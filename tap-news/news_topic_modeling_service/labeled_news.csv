6,Obama warned Trump about hiring Flynn,"Washington (CNN) Then-President Barack Obama warned President-elect Donald Trump in November against hiring retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser , former Obama administration officials confirmed to CNN Monday.

Obama warned Trump about Flynn during their Oval Office meeting on November 10, days after Trump was elected president.

Obama's concerns, which he relayed to Trump, were not related to the firing of Flynn from the Defense Intelligence Agency but rather in the course of the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election.

""Flynn's name kept popping up,"" according to a senior Obama administration source.

The White House confirmed later Monday that Obama raised concerns about Flynn during his Oval Office sitdown with Trump in November.

""It's true President Obama made it known he wasn't exactly a fan of Gen. Flynn's,"" press secretary Sean Spicer said.

He said the concerns shouldn't have come as a surprise, since Flynn was an ""outspoken critic"" of the Obama administration's shortcomings on foreign policy.

Spicer said if the Obama administration was ""truly concerned"" about Flynn, there are steps it could have taken, including suspending his security clearance.

Flynn previously served as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama until he was reportedly forced out of the post 2014 over internal disagreements over policy and management.

Trump did not heed Obama's counsel on Flynn, bringing aboard the former military intelligence officer who supported Trump during his campaign as his national security adviser. Trump fired Flynn 24 days later when news broke of Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.

News of the warning comes as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is set to testify before Congress on Monday about the concerns she expressed to Trump administration officials about Flynn's contacts with Russian officials, namely with Kislyak.

NBC News was the first to report the warning.

Yates, in her role as acting attorney general, warned White House counsel Don McGahn on January 26 that Flynn was lying when he denied -- both publicly and privately -- that he discussed US sanctions on Russia with Kislyak. It wasn't until weeks later that Trump asked for Flynn's resignation, only after news surfaced that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak.

JUST WATCHED Trump: I feel badly for Michael Flynn Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I feel badly for Michael Flynn 01:31

According to five current and former intelligence officials, their concern started around the time Flynn went to Moscow for the 10th anniversary gala of the state-sponsored news agency Russia Today. At that dinner, the former high-ranking intelligence official was seated right next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also had contact with Kislyak after the trip.

Former US officials were highly suspicious of Kislyak and his motives, and there were concerns Flynn didn't seem to understand the dangers in the conversations, the officials said. As was reported over the weekend, even Trump's own team was concerned enough to request a CIA profile of the Russian ambassador to help illustrate to Flynn he was taking a big chance in his interactions with Kislyak.

Yates' testimony on Monday will be the first time she speaks publicly about her warnings to the White House about Flynn.

The Senate and House intelligence committees are continuing to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, including potential coordination between Russian officials and the Trump campaign or people close to the campaign.

Congressional investigators have so far homed in on Flynn, Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, and Roger Stone, who informally advised Trump during his presidential run.

While Trump asked for Flynn's resignation, he has not abandoned his former national security adviser altogether.

Trump on Monday morning sought to get ahead of Yates' testimony, taking to Twitter to deflect criticism that he or his administration should have kept Flynn out of the top national security post from the outset.

General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama administration -- but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,"" Trump said in his first missive.

""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel,"" he tweeted.

Flynn began advising Trump on national security in early 2016 and soon became a constant presence by Trump's side as he crisscrossed the country from rally to rally.

He frequently introduced Trump on the campaign trail, delivering introductory remarks rife with criticism of the Obama administration's foreign policy and of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn often led Trump supporters in chants of ""Lock her up!"" as he accused her of corruption and negligence in her use of a private email server.

Trump came to value Flynn not only for his like-minded view of global affairs but for his loyalty throughout the campaign.",cnn
6,Why Trump didn't listen to all the people who told him to stay away from Michael Flynn,"Washington (CNN) Two days after Donald Trump won the presidency, he came to visit the man he would replace at the White House. And, in that meeting, Barack Obama warned Trump about bringing Michael Flynn into his administration due to concerns about the retired general's ties to Russia.

Trump did it anyway -- offering Flynn a job as national security adviser just eight days after meeting with Obama

The question now is why. Why, after being told by the outgoing president that Flynn was bad news -- in the sense that his name was all over the ongoing Justice Department investigation into Russia's attempts to hack the 2016 election -- did Trump ignore that advice within a week? And why has Trump continued to publicly defend Flynn in the face of repeated warnings -- from then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates among others -- that his ties to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak represented a major problem?

I put that question to several current and former Trump officials.

""I wish I knew,"" responded one. The others chose not to respond at all. Which is telling. (Or maybe they are just extremely busy!)

So what could explain Trump's unwillingness to listen to Obama -- and others -- about Flynn? Here are a few theories:

1. Dislike of Obama

JUST WATCHED Spicer: It's true, Obama wasn't a fan of Flynn Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Spicer: It's true, Obama wasn't a fan of Flynn 00:51

White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested Monday that while Obama did tell Trump about his concerns, it was seen through the lens of Flynn's active role as a Trump surrogate and critic of Obama. ""President Obama made it known that he wasn't a fan of General Flynn,"" Spicer said Monday. He added that if Obama felt so strongly about Flynn then his administration should not have approved his security clearance in April 2016.

There's no question that Trump, for all his insistence of how great he and Obama got along in their Nov. 10 meeting, viewed his election as a rejection of Obama's eight years in office. Taking Obama's advice on who to pick as one of his closest advisers would not be the sort of thing Trump would do.

2. Loyalty

Trump prizes loyalty above all else. And no one was more loyal to him than Flynn. Not only was Flynn an early endorser of Trump, he was one of his most aggressive and effective surrogates. By the end of the campaign, Flynn was Trump's de facto hype man/lead introducer at rallies.

Trump doesn't forget that sort of loyalty. And he wants to reward it.

3. Trusts his own judgment

Trump, as businessman and now a politician, believes that his gut is, in every situation, right. The campaign he ran, to his mind, was an affirmation of his gut being smarter and better than all of the advice the so-called professionals were offering. After all, they said he had no chance to win!

Given that, why listen to all the voices telling him to get as far away from Flynn as possible? Why not, on the other hand, embrace Flynn as a symbol of the very outsider movement that elected him in the first place?

While it's not clear exactly what motivated Trump to ignore all sorts of advice -- from President Obama on down -- about Flynn, it's very likely we won't ever know the real reason. Trump is not one to admit mistakes or explain himself. And he -- and his White House -- appear to be bunkered in when it comes to Flynn.",cnn
6,Sally Yates is about to bring back the Russia story in a big way,"Washington (CNN) Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates will testify in front of a Senate subcommittee Monday about what and when she told the Trump White House in regard to Michael Flynn's ties to Russia.

Yates' testimony will push the story of the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia back into the headlines, especially, if expected, she asserts that she warned Trump campaign officials that Flynn, the now-deposed national security adviser, was not telling the full truth about his contacts with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.

Both White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer have asserted that Yates passed along information about which the White House counsel checked out and found nothing

President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that the Russia investigations on Capitol Hill -- and the idea that senior members of his campaign were closely involved with Russian intelligence officials -- are ""fake news,"" a theme he kept up on Twitter Sunday.

When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?

He made a similar point on Monday, accusing the Obama administration of not properly vetting Flynn when he led the Defense Intelligence Agency during his predecessor's term: ""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.""

General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

He quickly added: ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. (counsel).""

Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

The problem for Trump is that there is a whole lot of smoke already surrounding his campaign and its ties to Russia -- with Flynn at the center of it all. Flynn was forced to resign after lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak, but since that time, we've learned he reportedly didn't properly report a speech he gave to a RT-TV, a Russia propaganda arm, and that he was paid at least $500,000 to represent Turkey's interests during the 2016 campaign. Late last week, The Washington Post reported that Flynn has been warned by Trump transition officials about the danger of speaking with Kislyak -- a detail CNN has now confirmed

Polling suggests there is significant suspicion regarding the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. In an April Washington Post-ABC News poll, 56% of those tested said that Russia tried to influence the election. Of that group the bulk -- 39% -- said the Trump campaign ""intentionally"" helped Russia's meddling.

The CIA and FBI have confirmed their belief that Russia sought to meddle in the election and that the country's interference was aimed at trying to keep Hillary Clinton from winning. There's no evidence yet that there was any sort of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

The re-emergence of the Russia investigation comes after, arguably, one of the better weeks of the Trump presidency -- capped by the House's passage of the American Health Care Act on Thursday.

Depending on what Yates says -- and how the White House reacts -- any momentum built from last week (and I am somewhat skeptical there was much) could disappear into thin air. Regardless, Yates' testimony -- and the latest news about Flynn -- is a reminder that the Russia story just isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

Trump and his administration are clearly frustrated by the Russia drumbeat. But their dismissive approach could well come back to bite them in regards Flynn this week and potentially in the future.

Whether this President likes it or not, the Russia story isn't going away anytime soon. Given that, he and his senior team have to figure out a better message than they've had to date.",cnn
16,Kushner family apologizes for mentioning White House adviser Jared Kushner,"A company owned by Jared Kushner's family is apologizing for mentioning the White House adviser at an investment conference in China.

Kushner Companies said Monday that the name drop at the event in Beijing on Saturday was not intended to be an ""attempt to lure investors"" to one of its projects in New Jersey.

Nicole Kushner Meyer, the sister of White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, mentioned her brother's new role in the administration during a pitch for her family's property. The New Jersey building makes use of an EB-5 visa program to draw in international investors, including the Chinese.

""In 2008, my brother Jared Kushner joined the family company as CEO, and recently moved to Washington to join the administration,"" she said at the conference.

A similar conference was held in Shanghai on Sunday.

On Monday, Kushner Companies said it didn't mean for the comment to be interpreted as an incentive for investors to sign onto the project.

""Ms. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,"" the company said in a statement.

Related: 'Invest $500,000 and immigrate' to United States

The EB-5 visa allows immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs in the United States. Kushner Companies says about 15% of its New Jersey building -- a $976.4 million residential and commercial project called 1 Journal Square -- will be funded through the EB-5 program.

The program is used by foreigners, particularly wealthy Chinese nationals, as a way into the United States. Lawmakers have criticized it as a way to essentially sell citizenship to the ultra rich.

While Nicole Kushner Meyer didn't reference President Trump by name, his photo appeared on a slide at the event that listed the ""key decision makers"" on the EB-5 program.

Kushner Companies later distanced itself from the photo. In a statement to CNNMoney on Monday, the company said the image ""was part of a presentation by the event's organizers.""

""Kushner Companies had nothing to do with it,"" it added.

Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog group, said he was skeptical of that explanation.

""You would think if they are going to take part in a marketing event for one of their properties, that they would want to see the PowerPoint,"" he said.

And even if the slide caught Kushner Meyer by surprise, Noble said the incident demonstrates why such connections can be dangerous. The company's foreign partners would understandably jump at the chance to push any perceived connections to the White House.

""They put themselves in a position where obviously people are going to be touting their connections,"" Noble said.

President Trump has made visa reform a central piece of its promised changes to immigration policy.

The White House said Monday that it is ""evaluating wholesale reform"" of the program along with Congress to ensure it is ""used as intended and that investment is being spread to all areas of the country.""

It added that the administration is ""exploring the possibility of raising the price of the visa to further bring the program in line with its intent.""

Related: Why wealthy Chinese are lining up to pay $500k for U.S. visas

Jared Kushner has stepped away from the business since taking a key role in Trump's White House.

His attorney, Blake Roberts, said Saturday that Kushner is not involved in the operation of Kushner Companies and divested his interests in the Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he, his wife and his children are not beneficiaries of, which was suggested by the Office of Government Ethics.

""As previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program,"" Roberts said in a statement.

Noble, the ethics attorney, said it's unlikely that Nicole Kushner Meyer violated any laws. In Jared Kushner's case, Noble said it depends on what he has divested and whether he follows through with the promise to not participate in EB-5 matters.

6,Pruitt removes scientists from key EPA board,"Story highlights An EPA spokesman disputed that anyone was dismissed

The EPA relies on independent science advisory committees to inform many of their decisions

Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency dismissed half the scientists who serve on a science review board that plays a crucial role in the work the EPA does, CNN has learned Monday.

The EPA relies heavily on the scientific guidance of the group when it comes to air and water quality when making policy decisions. An EPA spokesman told CNN there are a total of 18 positions on this particular advisory board, and nine of those scientists were not renewed following the end of their three-year term.

There is a notable ideological shift at the agency under the Trump administration and EPA head Scott Pruitt. Some in the scientific community say the dismissal of such a large number of scientists from the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors is further evidence of that.

Gretchen Goldman, research director at the Center for Science and Democracy asked, ""What's the scientific reason for removing these individuals from this EPA science review board? It is rare to see such a large scale dismissal even in a presidential transition.""

She added, ""The EPA is treating this scientific advisory board like its members are political appointees when these committees are not political positions. The individuals on these boards are appointed based on scientific expertise not politics. This move by the EPA is inserting politics into science. ""

6,Trump singles out historically black college funds in signing statement,"Story highlights Trump signed the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Friday

Signing statements are often used to flag provisions an administration might disregard

Washington (CNN) The White House pushed back Sunday on questions about a signing statement President Donald Trump added to the latest government spending bill Friday that said his administration would treat minority spending programs -- including one to help historically black colleges pay for construction -- in a manner consistent with the Constitution.

The signing statement ""simply indicates that the President will interpret those provisions consistent with the Constitution"" and is not dissimilar to signing statements issued by past presidents, a White House official said Sunday.

""The important thing to realize is: The President was able to secure big wins for his top priorities in this spending bill, including more than $25 billion in additional funding for the military, $1.52 billion for border security, a permanent extension of health coverage for retired miners, and a three-year extension of the DC school choice program,"" the official said.

Trump signed the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Friday, adding the statement: ""My administration shall treat provisions that allocate benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender ... in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.""

Those programs included historically black college financing, Native American housing block grants and minority business development, the statement said.

16,Life expectancy differs by 20 years between some US counties,"(CNN) Life expectancy at birth differs by as much as 20 years between the lowest and highest United States counties, according to new research published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

Dr. Christopher J.L. Murray, lead author of the study and director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, estimated life expectancy for each US county from 1980 through 2014. Murray and his colleagues analyzed county-level data and then applied a mathematical model to estimate the average length of lives.

Life expectancy at birth increased by 5.3 years for both men and women -- from 73.8 years to 79.1 years -- between 1980 and 2014, Murray and his colleagues wrote. During that time period, men gained 6.7 years, from 70 years on average to 76.7 years, while women gained four years, from 77.5 years to 81.5 years.

But the numbers aren't the same everywhere. Looking at the finer details, Murray and his colleagues calculated a gap of 20.1 years between US counties with the lowest and highest life expectancies.

The counties with lowest life expectancy are located in South and North Dakota, while counties along the lower half of Mississippi, in eastern Kentucky, and southwestern West Virginia also showed lower life expectancies compared to the rest of the nation. The North and South Dakota counties include Native American reservations.

At the other extreme, residents of counties in central Colorado can expect to live longest, Murray and his colleagues said.

'Drastically different life expectancies'

While the study does not directly answer why we see low or high life expectancies in specific counties, it does look at what factors contribute to the overall gap between some counties, said Murray.

""We can see that many of the counties with very low life expectancies in the Dakotas, like Oglala Lakota County in South Dakota, overlap with large Native American reservations including the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations,"" said Murray.

Conversely, Summit County, Colorado, ranked as the county with highest life expectancy in 2014 at 86.8 years, is home to several ski resort towns.

""For both of these geographies, the drastically different life expectancies are likely the result of a combination of risk factors, socioeconomics, and access and quality of health care in those areas,"" said Murray.

Yet, socioeconomic factors are not everything, said Murray, explaining that ""60% of the differences in life expectancy across counties can be explained by socioeconomic factors alone"" yet that leaves a ""substantial amount of unexplained differences.""

""Behaviors like smoking and physical activity, along with risk factors like obesity and diabetes, are also very important,"" he said.

Still, almost all counties throughout the nation showed improvement over time, though the number of additional years varied across the nation. Counties in central Colorado, Alaska and along both coasts experienced larger increases than most other counties. Meanwhile some southern counties in states from Oklahoma to West Virginia experienced either no improvement or very little over time.

The most positive note is that, over the study period, all counties show declines in the risk of early death for children under the age of 5 years old, say the authors. And, nearly all counties (about 98%) show declines in the risk of early death for people between the ages of 5 and 25, as well as those between 45 and 85.

However, people between the ages of 25 and 45 show an increased risk of death in 11.5% of counties over the study period.

The study didn't evaluate what might drive changes in mortality risks for specific age groups, Murray said, but he speculates that the same general factors that impact life expectancy overall may drive differences for those ages 25 to 45.

What causes differences in life expectancy? The reasons for life span inequality have been explored in previous studies so the current study examined the extent to which just three factors contributed to lower or higher survival. The three factors are socioeconomic levels and race/ethnicity, behavioral and metabolic risk, and health care.

""Risk factors -- obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes -- explained 74% of the variation in longevity,"" said Murray. ""Socioeconomic factors, a combination of poverty, income, education, unemployment, and race, were independently related to 60% of the inequality, and access to and quality of health care explained 27%.""

The authors used new methodologies that are more precise than past models, but county level data are all subject to error, the authors note. If recent trends are allowed to continue, the differences in life expectancy across counties will increase, not decrease, the researchers add.

'A gap of 20 years ... is absurd'

For the first time since 1993, US life expectancy in 2015 dropped significantly for the entire population, not just certain groups, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in late 2016 . CDC researchers warned that a one-year shift does not mark a trend.

Ellen Meara, a professor or health economist at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said many factors impact life expectancy. She was not involved in the new research.

""Socioeconomic factors like education and poverty can shorten lives of individuals, and it may be bad to live in areas with high rates of poverty and less educated adults,"" said Meara. ""Similarly, sedentary lifestyles (which are reflected in obesity rates) and smoking are two of the biggest individual risks of poor health and premature death. For people who develop a disease like diabetes or hypertension, also measured in the study at the county level, risk of death is higher.""

Meara noted that the authors used ""rigorous methods"" to gain a more ""comprehensive look"" at deaths by county and age group. ""This research echoes what we have been learning from studies in other settings over the past decade,"" she said. ""Disparities in mortality have widened over time.""

Still, understanding differences across geographic areas can provide clues, said Meara, about what might contribute to improvements over time.

""To have a gap of 20 years in a country as wealthy as ours is absurd,"" she said.

Murray agrees. ""The inequality in health in the United States -- a country that spends more on health care than any other -- is unacceptable,"" he said. ""Every American, regardless of where they live or their background, deserves to live a long and healthy life.""",cnn
3,Emmanuel Macron: Tough task ahead after victory in France,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Macron (centre left) on his first duty as president-elect, with President François Hollande

Emmanuel Macron took his first steps as France's president-elect on Monday but faces a tough task establishing a team that can govern effectively.

His party has announced it is changing name from En Marche to La Republique En Marche (Republic on the Move).

It must pick candidates quickly ahead of parliamentary elections on 11 and 18 June. It wants to be the biggest party but at the moment has no seats at all.

Mr Macron beat the far right's Marine Le Pen by 66.1% to 33.9% on Sunday.

But a low turnout and a record number of spoiled or blank votes showed disillusionment among many, particularly on the far left, at the choice they were given.

Ms Le Pen has also signalled there will be a change to her National Front party. There are suggestions from its officials, too, that it will change its name. But she has vowed to lead the ""new force"" into the parliamentary elections.

First day as president-elect, by the BBC's James Reynolds, Paris

Emmanuel Macron inherits one of the most powerful positions in Europe, and all the symbolism that comes with it.

This morning at the Arc de Triomphe, he showed no sign of being awed by his new job.

He walked alongside the outgoing President, François Hollande, as the two laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

They then shook hands with veterans. Mr Macron appeared to take longer to make his way through one receiving line, stopping to talk to elderly men, leaving Mr Hollande to wait for him at the end.

Emmanuel Macron now becomes France's youngest leader since Napoleon Bonaparte, whose battles are commemorated at the Arc de Triomphe. The new president will hope that his own fights are less bloody.

How difficult could it be for Mr Macron to govern?

He faces two main problems - a complete lack of representation in parliament and a deeply divided country.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption French election night in 120 seconds (including the accidental broadcast of the new president's speech preparations)

Apart from being, at 39, the country's youngest president, he is also the first from outside the two main parties since the founding of the modern republic in 1958.

Although he won support, sometimes grudgingly, from the established Socialists and Republicans, much of it stemmed from the need to beat Ms Le Pen. The conservative Republicans in particular will be looking for a strong showing in the parliamentary polls.

How to do the opinion polls stack up?

Polls released shortly after Mr Macron's victory suggested he and his allies in the centrist Modem party would come out top in the first round on 11 June, with 24%-26% of the vote.

Both the Republicans and National Front would have about 22%, the far-left France Unbowed 13%-15% and the Socialists, still smarting from François Hollande's unpopularity, 9%.

But the first-past-the-post system means it is difficult to gauge seat numbers. The National Front only has two seats and despite its candidate's performance in the presidential election, one poll suggested it might only get 15-25 in the 577 seat parliament.

Such uncertainty means Mr Macron might well be faced with a serious amount of horse trading to find allies to buy into his manifesto.

Another opinion poll in Le Figaro on Monday suggested many French people think this no bad thing.

The Kantar Sofres-OnePoint study suggested only 34% of those interviewed hoped the new head of state would have a majority in parliament.

The BBC's Lucy Williamson says Mr Macron's experience as economy minister has taught him that building cross-party consensus for each individual issue can be draining and dispiriting. Much will depend on whether his party can form a stable coalition.

Why the party name change?

It is part of the move to widen support, party secretary general Richard Ferrand said, adding that Mr Macron had now stepped down as party leader given his accession to the presidency.

Mr Macron intends to field candidates in all seats and has said half of them will be newcomers to politics - to try to introduce new blood. Half will be from Modem or defectors from other parties.

The idea is that the candidates will not have to give up their party affiliations but will need to run under the Republique En Marche banner.

Macron: The days ahead

10 May: Marks France's Slavery Remembrance Day, then in the afternoon attends the funeral of Corinne Erhel, the legislator who collapsed and died while speaking at a Macron rally last Friday. Official election results are published

14 May: President François Hollande formally hands over power to Mr Macron, who will start to announce his ministers, including a PM. He says he has made his choice for the post. It could be a woman, with one name touted that of former economy minister, Christine Lagarde

15-19 May: Mr Macron must finalise candidates for his party in the parliamentary election

11 and 18 June: Parliamentary election held over two rounds. All 577 seats are being contested in a first-past-the-post system

And the National Front?

Officials have suggested there will be a new name - also to broaden support.

Despite Marine Le Pen's efforts to refocus the party, it has continued to suffer from its past extremist associations under her father Jean-Marie Le Pen.

Nicolas Bay, party secretary-general, told the Associated Press: ""The National Front is a tool that will evolve to be more efficient, bring even more people together after the number of voters we reached last night.""

6,Immigration: Tories to keep 'tens of thousands' target,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: We still want to cut net migration to 'tens of thousands'

Theresa May has indicated that the Conservatives will again promise to cut net migration to the ""tens of thousands"" in their election manifesto.

Speaking in Harrow, she said migration levels were having an impact on public services and low-paid workers.

Asked if this meant the target - missed repeatedly since 2010 - could be hit, she said it was important to continue to aim for ""sustainable"" levels.

Other parties said the target was ""artificial"" and should be dropped.

On Sunday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused to say whether the pledge - which was in the 2010 and 2015 Tory manifestos - would be repeated but the BBC understands it will definitely be in the 2017 manifesto, due to be published next week.

Net migration is the difference between the numbers of people moving to the UK for more than a year, and the numbers of people leaving the UK to live elsewhere for a year or more. The most recent figure was 273,000 and the last year that it was below 100,000 was 1997.

Questions had been raised about whether the target would be retained after Culture Secretary Karen Bradley recently said that immigration was ""not about putting numbers on it"" but about ensuring Britain had the skilled workers it needed.

Analysis

By political editor Laura Kuenssberg

While Theresa May has recommitted to the target that she, as home secretary, missed for six years in a row, ministers have been busy reassuring businesses they will be able to get the people they need, whether builders, bankers, or fruit pickers. If the economy needs them, they will be allowed to come.

That doesn't sound like a recipe for getting the numbers down to Theresa May's preferred level. And even though we are on our way out of the EU, there is still huge scepticism over whether the target is remotely achievable. So why keep it?

Read more from Laura

Ms Rudd told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics on Sunday that while she believed immigration should be lower, the party had a ""lot to think through"" and the manifesto would not be ""identical"" to previous ones.

But on a campaign visit in north-west London, Mrs May indicated there would be no back-tracking from the target. Net migration numbers, she said, had gone up and down over the past few years but the commitment still stood.

""I think that it is important that we do say and continue to say that we do want to bring migration to sustainable levels. We believe that is the tens of thousands.""

She added: ""Once we leave the EU, we will of course have the opportunity to ensure we have control of our borders. We will be able to establish our rules for people coming from the EU. That is a part of the picture we have not been able to control before.""

EU migrants accounted for about 44% of the 596,000 people who came to the UK in the year to last September,

Of these, an estimated 294,000 came to work, 134,000 were long-term students, 74,000 came to join existing family members while 61,000 came for other reasons - including asylum seekers and those receiving medical treatment.

Before the Brexit vote, the Conservatives sought to reduce the ""pull factors"" which it said were attracting EU migrants, such as access to benefits. Now they have promised new migration controls once freedom of movement no longer applies, but they have yet to set out the precise model they would adopt.

Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, said he expected the target to apply to a longer period than five years and possibly exclude certain groups.

""The key question is to what point this is going to be a flexible target... and react to the economy and new developments in the country,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today.

Image caption There have been calls for students to be taken out of the migration statistics

""The previous one was fixed. It did not change over five years. Maybe this one will be adjusted along the way.""

But he said ministers would still face the challenge of reducing levels of migration from outside the EU. Although figures are currently at a three year low and well down on 2010, they remain above the 250,000 mark. Students currently account for about 70% of the total.

Labour says it accepts that the principle of the free movement of people - which EU leaders say goes hand-in-hand with single market membership - would have to end after Brexit but that new immigration controls should not be the ""overarching priority"" as the UK leaves.

Jeremy Corbyn said migrants working in the UK's public services made a ""massive contribution"" and changes to the system resulting from Brexit had to be fair.

""Theresa May made that promise in 2010 and made the same promise in 2015, and didn't get anywhere near it on any occasion at all,"" he said.

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the target was a product of political manoeuvring and ""meant very little"" while Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said it had helped ""split up families and encouraged hostility towards migrants"".

UKIP said the target was ""vacuous"" and the Conservatives had broken their promises ""time and time again"" on the issue.

Announcing its own proposals, including a five-year ban on unskilled and low-skilled foreign labour, it said its ambition to reduce net migration to zero would put ""clear water"" between itself and the other parties.

3,Obama warned Trump about hiring Michael Flynn,"Image copyright Getty Images

Barack Obama warned newly elected President Donald Trump against hiring Michael Flynn as national security adviser, the White House has confirmed.

Mr Obama warned his successor less than 48 hours after the November election during a conversation in the Oval Office, former Obama officials said.

Mr Flynn's contacts with a Russian ambassador are expected to come up in a Senate hearing on Monday.

He was fired in February for concealing the nature of these contacts.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the Trump administration about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before the inauguration.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the daily briefing on Monday: ""It's true that President Obama made it known that he wasn't exactly a fan of General Flynn's.""

But Mr Spicer said that should not come as a surprise ""given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama [and] was an outspoken critic of President Obama's shortcomings specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting Isis and other threats around that were facing America"".

Who is Michael Flynn?

Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake

The Obama administration fired Mr Flynn from his role as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, citing issues of mismanagement and temperament.

Mr Obama's warning to Mr Trump came before concerns emerged about Mr Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador, a former Obama official told NBC News.

The Democratic president reportedly thought Mr Flynn was not suited for such a high-level position.

An ongoing feud - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

When Mr Trump sat down with Mr Obama just two days after winning the election last November, it was smiles all around. Now, according to reports, it turns out Mr Obama spent part of the time warning him to steer clear of Michael Flynn - and the president-elect ignored his advice.

In hindsight, Mr Trump would have been better served heeding his predecessor's advice, as the ensuing scandal over contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak quickly ended Flynn's controversial tenure as the president's national security advisor.

The timing of this revelation, just hours before Sally Yates is set to testify Mr Flynn's Russian ties and her own efforts to warn the Trump administration, is no fluke.

The president took a shot at the woman he fired as acting attorney general via Twitter this morning, and now Mr Obama's team is coming - anonymously - to her defence.

It's yet the latest bit of evidence of an ongoing feud between the past and present presidential administrations as well as the tension between Mr Trump's inner circle and the US intelligence community.

The stakes are high, and there's no indication anyone is backing down.

But on Monday, Mr Spicer questioned the former president's objections to Mr Flynn.

""If Mr Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn,"" the White House press secretary told reporters, ""why didn't he suspend General Flynn's security clearance, which they had just reapproved months earlier?

""Additionally, why did the Obama administration let Flynn go to Russia for a paid speaking engagement and receive a fee?""

The revelation came as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified for the first time in public before a Senate panel about Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

Ms Yates, a 27-year Justice Department prosecutor, was fired in January by Mr Trump for refusing to uphold the administration's travel ban.

President Trump on Monday appeared to accuse Ms Yates of leaking information to media on Twitter.

10,"Surface Pro 5 doesn’t even exist yet, says Microsoft exec","It seems we won’t see the launch of a Surface Pro 5 any time in the near future, sadly, although Microsoft may well give the current Surface Pro 4 a spec bump at an event later this month.

There are several sources chattering about Microsoft’s hybrid range, the main one being CNET who interviewed Panos Panay, chief Surface dude at Microsoft (corporate vice president for Surface Computing, to be precise).

At the close of the interview, CNET pressed Panay on what we’ve all been wondering: that given the Surface Pro 4 is getting pretty long in the tooth, where is its successor which has previously been rumored to be incoming for a while now?

Panay essentially replied that the Surface Pro 4 would remain a competitive product for five more years, and that he was “super, super sure” of that – in other words, buy the SP4, there’s no need to hold out for a Surface Pro 5.

Mainly because the SP5 is not coming until the company develops some “meaningful changes” for the hardware. In other words, not just a processor upgrade, but a big boost on vital aspects such as battery life and/or making the device thinner and lighter (generally more portable).

Panay told CNET: “When it's meaningful and the change is right, we'll put it on market.”

He clarified: “You'll see that same meaningful impact when Pro 5, or Pro Next hits the market,"" swiftly adding that, ""there's no such thing as a Pro 5.""

In other words, there’s no such thing as a finished Surface Pro 5 design right now, meaning that it’s still a long way down the line.

These are the best laptops you can buy in the meantime

Shanghai surprise

At the same time, Microsoft has an event in Shanghai, China on May 23 which is Surface-related, where it will ‘show the world what’s next’. Panay will be there, and tweeted about the event with the hashtag #surface.

Clearly, though, this isn’t going to be the Surface Pro 5 – Panay was clear about that in the CNET interview – but Microsoft may reveal a new juiced-up Surface Pro 4 model, which matches up with what we heard from the hybrid grapevine last month, namely that a ‘Surface Pro 4.5’ was in the works.

In other words, a light refresh introducing Kaby Lake CPUs to the current range, and possibly some other minor hardware boosts. Similar to what happened with the Surface Book when Microsoft introduced the Performance Base variant (there’s still no news on the Surface Book 2, either).

As ever, this is all speculation, but at least we won’t have to wait long to see what Microsoft has planned, because this Chinese press shindig is only a couple of weeks away.",techradar
10,"The next Amazon Echo might have a screen, but does it really need one?","Part of what made the original Amazon Echo such a surprising and original product was how it completely removed the touch-screen, which has become our default way of interacting with digital devices.

But recent leaks point towards the next generation of Amazon Echo speakers coming equipped with a touch screen of their own, a dramatic change of direction for Amazon’s home-based voice assistants.

Amazon isn’t the only company reportedly considering combining a screen with a non-portable voice assistant since Apple’s rumored Siri Speaker will also reportedly feature a screen.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

But wouldn't the move negate entirely what Amazon has attempted to accomplish with Alexa? Releasing a piece of consumer electronics without a screen was a bold move, and it came with some significant challenges, but until now we’d expected Amazon to persevere with improving its audio-based interface.

Since the very first computers we’ve relied upon screens to provide the majority of their output, so it’s going to require some significant work to provide the same functionality through voice.

In spite of the challenge, I was always hoping that Amazon would struggle through and do the hard work required to make it work. Releasing a device with a screen seems to imply that the company has, at least partially, thrown in the towel.

Except Amazon has already conceded that certain actions will require a screen. Attempt to manage a to-do list using your Echo, for example, and you still currently need to use the Alexa companion app on your smartphone to tick off tasks as ‘done’. Want to change the default music player? You’ll need to dig into Alexa’s settings, on your smartphone.



So where's this heading?

It can be hard to think about the end-goal of an initiative like the Amazon Echo because nothing like it has ever existed.

But it might be helpful to think of it as being having the equivalent of personal butler sitting in your living room, waiting to help you out with your day.

Ask a butler what letters you’ve received and you’d never expect them to read out each of your letters for you, you’d hope that they’d show you the most important ones directly. In a similar way, it would get frustrating quickly to have an Echo read out your entire inbox, but an Echo with a screen could pick the most important emails to show to you.

Similarly if you were asking a butler for traffic advice, rather than them trying to describe exactly where the congestion is, it would be much for convenient for them to show you a map, and point to the difficult roads so you can avoid them. An Echo with a screen would be much better in this regard.

At a certain point, is this what the Echo is going to turn into?

Although entirely voice-based assistants seem like a cool future, the truth is that there’s certain information that will always be easier to display visually, and having to rely on pulling a smartphone out of your pocket simply isn’t as convenient as simply showing you directly on the device.

Although Amazon has yet to officially confirm the existence of the product, the quality of the leaks, combined with the existence of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, makes this a convincing direction for Amazon to take.

And, frankly, I’m ok with it. I love my Echo, but only part of that is because it’s a smart device I can control with my voice. Mostly I just like having a mini computer set up in my kitchen to deal with occasional queries that it’s not worth fetching my phone to do.

So ultimately an Echo with a screen isn’t quite the change of direction that it had originally seemed. If handled well it could be just a better way of presenting you with the information you need without overwhelming you with minutes of lengthy audio explanation.

All that we need now is for Amazon to actually officially confirm the existence of the device, but given how finished the leaked shots look, I can’t imagine it’s far off.",techradar
10,"Apple Siri Speaker: release date, news and rumors","After first appearing on phones, voice assistants entered the home in a big way with the Amazon Echo , a speaker that was equipped with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant.

While Apple has had a voice assistant, Siri, on its phones for some time now, it has so far been left behind when it comes to smart speakers. Competitor Google brought its own voice assistant to dedicated hardware with the Google Home speaker last year.

Rumors have been circulating for a while now that both Microsoft and Apple are planning on bringing their voice assistants, Cortana and Siri respectively, to the home in the form of smart speakers.

Read on for all the information we have so far about Apple’s rumored smart speaker.

Cut to the chase

What is it? A rumored smart speaker equipped with Apple’s Siri voice assistant

A rumored smart speaker equipped with Apple’s Siri voice assistant When is it out? TBA – Apple is yet to confirm that it actually exists

TBA – Apple is yet to confirm that it actually exists What will it cost? Competitors range in price from $50 to $180 – Apple’s will likely be priced towards the high end of this range

Apple Siri Speaker release date

The most recent rumor points towards a launch in the second half of this year , in time for the Christmas shopping season, after an announcement at Apple’s annual developer showcase, WWDC, which this year takes place in June.

However we’re slightly skeptical of this rumor for a couple of reasons.

First is the fact that WWDC is traditionally a conference where Apple talks about software rather than hardware, so talking about a new piece of smart speaker hardware would be highly unusual.

Secondly we’re skeptical that the speaker would be announced as early as WWDC, only to be released much later in the second half of the year, as Apple likes to release hardware as soon as possible after it’s announced; each year the iPhone is released just 10 days after its initial announcement, for example.

There have been exceptions to this rule such as the AirPods , which released around three months after they were originally announced, but for the most part Apple maintains a fast turnaround between announcement and release.

Unfortunately this doesn’t leave us with much of an idea about when the smart speaker might be coming, but after hearing that Apple employees are already testing prototypes in their own homes , we’re guessing it’s not far away .

Apple Siri Speaker features

If you want to get an idea of what a Siri speaker would be capable of, then Siri on your iPhone is a good place to start.

Currently Siri is able to sync up with a number of the iPhone’s core features. It can add reminders to the reminders app, create events in the calendar app, set alarms and timers, call and video ""Facetime"" call contacts, and find and read emails.

Siri is also heavily integrated into Apple HomeKit , which is the company’s home automation ecosystem, that allows you to control all of your connected devices from a single app. Using HomeKit you can have Siri turn on your lights, increase your home’s thermostat, or even activate a ceiling fan.

Check out our full list of the devices that work, or will work, with Apple HomeKit .

However, Siri has some significant problems compared to competing voice services.

For example, it heavily prioritises Apple’s own apps rather than allowing you to use alternatives. Ask Siri to play some music, and it will only be able to play songs that are currently stored in your Apple Music app.

This is in contrast to both Alexa and Google Assistant, which both allow you to use a music app of your choice, rather than restricting you to Amazon Prime Music and Google Play music respectively.

Amazon has been especially open with allowing developers to integrate their services into its smart speakers. It allows the creation of ‘Skills’ which essentially act as apps for the smart speaker, and so far there have been over 10,000 of them created for the speaker .

On a basic intelligence level, Siri also has a number of problems. Ask it when the Mona Lisa was painted (the year 1503, art buffs), and the voice assistant will happily tell you that ‘the answer is one thousand, five hundred and three,’ rather than being intelligent enough to realise that the year should be read aloud as ‘fifteen oh-three’.

Of course there’s always the chance that Apple will put significant effort into improving Siri before the technology finds its way into a smart speaker. Google did a similar thing when it overhauled Google Now, creating Google Assistant, in the months before the Google Home was released.

Meanwhile, recent comments by Apple VP Phil Schiller suggest Apple is thinking along the lines of a Siri speaker with an integrated screen - so basically just a big iPad with better audio, then?

Facial recognition

Previously, smart speakers focussed entirely on the voice, and recognising the commands that are spoken by the user.

However, there are some rumors that Apple’s rumored smart speaker might feature facial recognition via a built-in camera.

The technology could be used to recognise which users are interacting with the device, allowing it to cater to their individual preferences in music or lighting.

Over the past two years Apple has acquired the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient, which suggests that such technology is something that the company is exploring.

Apple’s speaker would not be the first to feature a built-in camera. The recently announced Amazon Echo Look has a built in camera, which is used to recognise and recommend clothing choices.

Google Home recently added the ability to recognise users based on the sound of their voice , and we’d imagine that Apple would want to feature similar functionality if it wants to compete with the existing major players in the market.



Emotion sensing

Related to the facial recognition capability is a recent rumor that the smart speaker will be able to recognise user’s emotions .

We’re not entirely sure what this could end up adding to the overall user experience, but it’s funny to think that the speaker could theoretically play different music depending on how it reads your mood.

Beats technology

Another recent rumor points towards the device making use of ‘some form of Beats technology’, although it’s unclear exactly what this could be.

It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS27 April 2017

Apple needs to improve Siri’s ability to recognise our voice, since we’ve found that its current implementation on phones can be a little flaky. Could a Beats-built microphone fit the bill?

The big development with Beats headphones over the last year has been the introduction of Apple's new W1 bluetooth chip, which makes it a lot easier to pair the headphones to an iPhone, and also improves battery life.

Obviously that latter point isn't as important for a speaker that's likely to be mains, rather than battery, powered, but it would be a great feature if the speaker could be easily paired to your phone by simply holding it close by. Could this perhaps be another way of identifying the user – by proximity to the W1 chip?

Apple Siri Speaker AirPlay

The Amazon Echo Dot has a 3.5mm audio jack output that allows it to plug into a stereo, and Google Home integrates with the Chromecast.

Allegedly Apple’s Siri speaker will offer similar functionality thanks to an integration with Apple’s AirPlay technology, which allows users to stream video and audio from their phone to a television or stereo respectively.

Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.27 April 2017

A new challenger has entered the arena

Smart speakers are one of the most unexpected and cool technologies to have come out over the past couple of years, and interesting to see each of the technology giants repurposing their existing voice assistants to work in a home context.

Apple isn't the only one with such a device on the horizon. Microsoft appears to be readying a home speaker equipped with its Cortana voice assistant, and between that and Google's existing smart speaker efforts, the market is set to get crowded very quickly.

Apple has a real chance of standing out when it comes to its home automation efforts thanks to HomeKit, but it's not as strong when it comes to integrating with non-Apple services such as Spotify.

Apple's next major conference is set to be WWDC in June, but as previously mentioned, we would be surprised to see a hardware reveal come out of the software-focussed show.

Then again when it comes to Apple anything is possible, so keep your eyes trained on the McEnery Convention Centre in San Jose from 5-9 June for any new information about Apple's voice controlled ambitions.",techradar

The new PS4 Slim launched in September 2016 for around £259 (500GB) or £310 (1TB). This new model has effectively replaced the original PS4 now.

10,BlackBerry KeyOne review,"BlackBerry KeyOne is a sophisticated-looking smartphone that resurrects a physical keyboard in the modern Android era. Its tactical QWERTY keyboard offers a dose of nostalgia, while its smart and secure software give businesses some peace of mind. Just know that the mid-range specs will only get you so far and its entertainment capabilities make this BlackBerry feel as if it clocks out at 5pm sharp when it comes to the fun stuff.

Move over, Samsung Galaxy S8 . The BlackBerry KeyOne is the latest smartphone comeback story of 2017, even if the company behind it is really China’s TCL Communications.

It’s touted as the most secure Android phone, pre-loaded with smart, enterprise-level mobile software and, at last, delivers an old-school physical keyboard within a modern enough design.

This is the reinvented BlackBerry for everyone wholly determined to reclaim a tactile keyboard and BlackBerry Messenger. It works great for typing once you get used to the keyboard again.

‘CrackBerry’ addicts have something to look forward to here. But it’s a workaholic. BlackBerry KeyOne is all business in the front and back, less of a multimedia party anywhere in between.

The screen is bright and colorful, but its 3:2 aspect ratio leaves you with black bars on all 16:9 video and small-looking movies. The audio comes out one bottom-firing speaker. It’s like this phone clocks out at 5pm sharp when it comes to the fun stuff.

BlackBerry KeyOne is clearly an Android phone that has productivity users in mind. It’s one of the best at helping you manage tasks, even if it doesn’t have the latest chipset. It works as an entertainment device, too, but it’s not the best at it.

Does this new BlackBerry phone have enough of an enterprise advantage to lure you back from your on-screen, makebelieve keyboard? Let’s get down to business and put it to the test.

Price and release date

£499 in the UK at Selfridges and Carphone Warehouse

$549 in the US unlocked on May 31 and on-contract via Sprint later this summer

The BlackBerry KeyOne price is somewhere in between Wall Street and Main Street, costing $549 (£499, AU$729). It’s cheaper than an iPhone 7 or the Samsung Galaxy S8.

What it lacks in top-of-the-line internal chip specs it tries to make up for with unique features like sophisticated software and its physical keyboard. It’s a trade-off that makes it slightly cheaper.

There are two versions of the BlackBerry KeyOne in the US: an unlocked version that’s GSM and CDMA capable across the networks, and a summer-bound CDMA model for Sprint.

If you're lucky enough to be in or around London, England, you can get your hands on a BlackBerry KeyOne right now - with prestigious store Selfridges securing world exclusive availability until May 5.

After May 5, you'll be able to purchase the KeyOne throughout the UK at Carphone Warehouse, with more retailers and carriers coming on board through the month.

The BlackBerry KeyOne US release date is a longer wait. The unlocked model is scheduled for May 31, with the same on-sale date in Canada, too.

Keyboard

BlackBerry's signature keys return, spurning the new all-screen trend

Makes for a more precise, but slow typing experience

Neat tricks: 52 key shortcuts, trackpad-like movement and suggested word-flicking gestures

The Blackberry KeyOne is all about its physical keyboard in a world dominated by touchscreen iPhones and Androids. It’s the exact opposite of the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 all-screen trend.

BlackBerry’s signature keyboard is a welcomed change if you miss the tactile feedback of a real smartphone keyboard. It’s a throwback to a time before throwback Thursday was ‘a thing.’

It’s a throwback to everyone’s old Monday through Friday daily driver with 35-chicklet-style keys, and each one it properly backlit. There’s no need for an on-screen keyboard to hog your display.

It does take several hours of typing to re-learn how use it. At first, it’s problematic. B shares a key with ! and caused us to say “How’s your day goingB” with quickly apologize. “Sorry, mom.”

We found ourselves making fewer mistakes going back to a BlackBerry, but overall slower at typing. While we sped up our characters-per-minute output over time, we were never faster versus typing on an on-screen keyboard. Just more accurate and less autocorrect dependent.

There are several new twists to make life easier. It has 52 customizable shortcuts, so every long and short press gets you somewhere faster. Hold down on the ‘I’ key while on the home screen and you instantly get to Instagram.

Blackberry KeyOne has three-word suggestions across the bottom of the touchscreen as part of its contextual next word prediction engine. It’s smart, but could use punctuation predictions.

Also, don’t expect helpful emoji predictions like you would on iOS 10 . That’s too fun for a BlackBerry. Emojis are buried two menus deep.

You can, however, select a suggested word without ever lifting your thumbs from the keyboard. Just slide up on the keys and it’ll almost flick the word right onto the screen.

This word-flicking gesture works most of the time in one upward motion and feels slightly faster than tapping one of the on-screen choices. At times, we’d accidentally hit one of the capacitive buttons – home, back or recent – which sit in between the screen and keyboard.

The entire keyboard also acts as a trackpad, so you can scroll through menus and web pages as you lightly pet the keys. You, again, don’t need to put your fingers on the screen.

Flicking suggested words onto the screen and scrolling with the keyboard makes the screen feel slightly bigger, though we did run into instances where we tried to begin typing a text and were suddenly scrolling up our message history.

Phone design

Two-tone sophisticated look: black soft touch back and silver accents

Biometric fingerprint scanner is hidden inside the space bar

Ironically named connivence key is more annoying than it is helpful

Strangely, no dual-SIM option for international business travelers

The BlackBerry KeyOne has an air of sophistication to it, even as it blends the old and the new technology. It looks like a productivity tool carried by the workforce elite.

Its screen-and-keyboard combo is outlined in a silver anodized aluminum frame and backed by a black, soft grip textured rear cover. This stylish, two-toned look is has real character.

No, the rubberized back isn’t really leather, but it gives off that impression. The anodized aluminum frame is scratch-resistant and stood up to some completely on purpose minor abuse.

The most clever thing about this new BlackBerry design is that it hides the fingerprint sensor inside the small space bar at the bottom of the phone. It’s an odd shape for a biometric scanner.

The good news is that the blended fingerprint sensor works really well here with a near 0% fail rate. It’s also easy to access on the front and it can wake the phone from a screen-off state.

BlackBerry KeyOne likes to mix things up when it comes to the its buttons and headphone jack. The power is on the left side, the volume rocker is on the right and the 3.5mm jack is at the top. It’s like this grown-up smartphone is secretly a kid still playing opposite day.

There’s another button – the convenience button – that throws one more shortcut into design. It can be mapped to anything you want, unlike Samsung’s draconian Bixby button that does little.

We mapped the convenience button to launch the camera app, but found it more annoying than helpful due to its easy-to-mispress location. “Oh, the camera is open... again.”

During calls, it functions as a mute button, which we found useful. It’s easy to remember this button exists during active calls, not when you’re first picking up your smartphone from a table. “Again, with the camera opening?!”

KeyOne is the second BlackBerry to use USB-C (after last year’s BlackBerry DTEK60 ) and this new, reversible USB standard is a helpful change, as it uses Quick Charge 3.0 for faster charging. Your old collection of monodirectional BlackBerry mini and micro USB cables are now useless.

There are two changes we would have liked to see in an otherwise great update the BlackBerry design. The mono speaker on the bottom frame helps no one, on-the-go entertainment seekers and business speakerphone devotees alike.

We’re also surprised the the BlackBerry KeyOne doesn’t have a dual nano SIM tray when many unlocked phones out of China now have options for using either a second SIM or microSD card. This just has the latter expandable storage option, not dual-SIM to the chagrin of jet-setting international business travelers.

Screen

4.5-inch Full HD screen feels like a 5.5-inch screen due to bigger width and your thumbs staying put on the keyboard

The bright display looks great, but its 3:2 aspect ratio forces 16:9 video to feel small by placing black bars at the top and bottom

This is not a multimedia showstopper, it's a workhorse

The BlackBerry KeyOne display shares the front face of the phone with the keyboard, so it can’t compare to an trendy new all-screen Android phone. You just can have everything in life.

What it does is give you a bright, but misshapen 4.5-inch Full HD screen. One third of the real estate taken up by non-screen parts (keyboard, capacitive buttons and a front-facing camera).

It feels like a 5.5-inch display thanks to its familiar 3-inch width, and we wouldn’t want it much longer. Anything taller would make this already 180g phone feel top-heavy when holding the very bottom of the keyboard.

We end up with a screen that’s bright, colorful and gives you more usable space thanks to the the keyboard and trackpad-like scrolling. But not every app adjusts to a 1,620 x 1,080 resolution.

You’re going to run into problems with the 3:2 aspect ratio on a daily basis. All 16:9 video feels extra small with top and bottom black bars. Snapchats and Instagram Stories are also cut off.

The good news is that most scrollable productivity apps and interactive games adapt to the size. It’s just movies and fixed-length photo apps that give the BlackBerry KeyOne trouble.

You’ll find split-screen multitasking thanks to Android 7.1 Nougat, but it’s a bit cramped. There are a few sacrifices if you want a keyboard on a smartphone in the modern day.",techradar
10,"Star Wars Battlefront 2 release date, news and rumors","Update: Rumors are circulating that Star Wars Battlefront 2 could feature some kind of VR content. NeoGaf users in European territories have spotted PlayStation promotional materials that have a ""compatible with VR"" badge on them.

This in combination with tweets from Alex Mole, CTO of VR mission development team Criterion, which stated his team were collaborating on ""something awesome"" in the sequel means there is a chance of some more VR Star Wars content in the future.

Original article continues below...

Things are pretty great for Star Wars fans at the moment: not only are new films coming on the regular, according to EA's Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen there are going to be a handful of games from various studios too.

The next exciting title in the Star Wars franchise is, of course, EA Dice’s Battlefront 2, the sequel to the franchise reboot first released in 2015.

When it was first released, Star Wars Battlefront received a mixed reception with some praising how it captured the Star Wars atmosphere perfectly with its excellent cinematic visuals while others bemoaned its repetitive combat and limited depth and content.

In spite of criticisms, the game still sold over 14 million copies and counting. With a sequel on the way, though, EA has the chance to learn from the first release and create something bigger and better.

If these words from EA CFO Blake Jorgensen are anything to go by, that’s exactly what we’re going to get: “If there was criticism, they just wanted more. So we're taking that criticism to heart as we build the next game and trying to address any of the issues that they had.”

And address it they have.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The sequel to the multiplayer-focused shooter Star Wars Battlefront

The sequel to the multiplayer-focused shooter Star Wars Battlefront When can I play it? November 17 2017

November 17 2017 What can I play it on? PS4, Xbox One and PC

Trailers and screenshots

The Star Wars Battlefront 2 trailer has been a story in and of itself. First we saw leaked version before the trailer was originally set to launch before it was pulled down much to our chagrin. But that all changed on April 15 when we got the official trailer during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.

The trailer gives fans a glimpse of the game's single-player campaign which it appears will revolve around an ""untold soldier's story"" in the Empire. As well as this single-player campaign that appears to be set in the period following the Empire's defeat at Endor, there'll also be a multiplayer mode of the game which will span ""across all eras.""

This means we'll see locations and characters from the series' original trilogy as well as the prequels and new films. The trailer gives us a look at characters like Rey, Kylo Ren, Yoda and Darth Maul across a variety of locations. It also looks like there will indeed be exciting space battles involved.

Release date

Turns out, November and December are going to be great months for Star Wars fans. Star Wars Battlefront 2 will see a worldwide release on November 17 2017, followed shortly by the theatrical release of Star Wars Episode 8 The Last Jedi one month later on December 15.

What this means is that the game will be out slightly ahead of the movie – and thus has the potential to give us a brief look at new locations and new ships from the upcoming film.

That being said, those who pre-order the game will have access to two new skins – Episode 8 variations of Kylo Ren and Rey – as well as two new ships – the Episode 8 variation of the Millennium Falcon and a yet undisclosed ship from the new movie.

What we know we'll see

Thanks to the Star Wars Celebration panel, we now have expert insight into what we can expect when the game comes out. There are two important new additions here: a story mode and space battles.

Single player campaign

Let's start first by looking at the game's new single-player mode.

In it, you'll play as Iden Versio, a member of the Imperial Forces elite ops unit called Inferno Squad, a combination of expert Tie Pilots and covert commandos. During the trailer for the game we watch Iden witness the destruction of the second Death Star above the moon of Endor. Without direct missions from the now-deceased Emperor, Iden leads her squad on a mission of revenge to try and quell the Rebellion.

To that end, Battlefront II will occupy the time between the sixth film of the franchise, Return of the Jedi, and the seventh film, The Force Awakens.

After the battle on Endor, players will travel to Iden's homeworld, a planet that has been under Imperial control for the entirety of her life. Instead of an martial law-loving Imperial city that we've seen in the past, however, Ida's homeworld has come to embrace and love the Empire. This love hits home the theme that the single-player campaign is going for, which is that yes, the Rebellion had heroes, but so did the Empire.

In a recent interview with Eurogamer single player game director Mark Thompson and Criterion's Matt Webster revealed that the single player campaign will be “a continuous story with a beginning a middle and an end” rather than separate missions and war stories like Battlefield 1.

Players will follow Iden for 30 years, from the end of Jedi up to the Force Awakens at Starkiller base, though there will be moments in the story where the player will switch sides and play ""from the perspective of one of the iconic heroes because [...] that’s just part of Battlefront’s DNA.”

In the trailer it was revealed that Iden will have a droid. According to Thompson, this droid will offer players a way to customize their play style while they're playing as Iden. For example, he says it will offer them choice when it comes to how they engage in a combat scenario so we imagine the droid will be able to be used as back up in combat, as a scout or perhaps even as a tool for hacking.

Considering the Motive development team has been brought in to work on the single-player specifically, there’s little chance of it feeling like a tacked on afterthought and we're excited to see how this will play out.

It's been confirmed that Battlefront 2 will explore characters, locations and events from the new films and prequel trilogy as well as the original trilogy.

That means that in addition to characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo and Boba Fett, players will get to take control of characters such as Rey, Kylo Ren, Yoda and Darth Maul.

The other interesting addition in this iteration will be space battles. These will be developed by Criterion and will allow players to engage in epic dogfights over some of the most iconic battlefields in the Star Wars universe.

Combat with depth

In a recent interview with PC Gamer, Star Wars Battlefront 2's creative director Bern Diemer said that DICE wants to add depth the game's multiplayer modes.

This time around Heroes will apparently not be all-powerful game changers as they once were. As well as making Heroes more present and not restricted to a ""lucky few"" players, DICE will add something called team play to make sure that those playing as standard troopers are not at an unfair advantage.

Team play is based on classes and leveling and encourages players to join up with their friends in well-balanced squads in order to take down heroes.

Matt Webster revealed that there will be 4 Trooper classes which are differentiated by standard things like range and firepower.

There will, apparently be ""customization and progression inside the Trooper classes, inside Heroes and inside Starfighters. So whilst they have clear lines of class types, there is customization within those.""

Webster said they'll reveal exactly how that will work at a later date, but we imagine gadgets will have something to do with it as Diemer told PC Gamer that to improve personalization and depth, abilities and gadgets will also be introduced. According to Diemer different classes in the game will have access to different items.

For example, Diemer said that troopers don't really ""have a personality"" and to give them one ""you need to be able to customize them in some way so it feels right. I really like using grenades, so I might try to pull my class a little bit towards my favorite toy or my favorite gadget.”

It's also been confirmed that there will be no more blue pick ups to become a Hero character, with Webster explaining that “it was becoming a brief experience for the lucky few, or people were just hunting and hanging around the spawn locations for tokens. So we wanted to expand the hero play within a battle, we wanted to increase that scope but also have a better system for players to be able to become a hero than just picking up a token.”

This addition of classes and squads brings Battlefront 2 more in line with DICE's other multiplayer shooter releases such as Battlefield.

Will there be VR?

It’s been revealed that Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission developer Criterion is involved in the development of Battlefront 2 which points to the idea that there will perhaps be some VR content involved with the game, or at least the addition of some epic space battle missions.

In a recent interview, it was revealed that as far as the team is concerned “We are not talking about VR at the moment for Battlefront 2. That's a story for another day…” That's not a direct no, but it does confirm that Criterion's main involvement is with regards to improving space battles and making them more dynamic and open.

What we'd like to see

Diversity in game modes

It’s not that there was a dearth of modes in the first Battlefront game, but after a while they all began to feel very similar. Something we’d really like to see in Battlefront 2 is either more game modes that feel a little different or at the very least the same number of game modes, just with some tweaks to make them feel a little more distinct from one another.

Some free or cheaper content

The original Battlefront has free content and that’s great but the content it charges for felt slightly too expensive, especially alongside the use of micro-transactions. So, what can the sequel do to change that?

Well, first off, eliminating paid DLC would be a good first step – and, from the sounds of it, that's exactly what's going to happen. According to IGN, Star Wars Battlefront II won't offer a season pass this time around, meaning that DLC will most likely be supplied for free.

The DLC for the first game was pretty pricey considering the cost of the original game but for many players it became a necessary purchase to continue enjoying the game as older maps lost their popularity and it became a struggle to find good matches using them.

Split-screen co-op

Our last request is for split-screen co-op. This was an important feature of the first two games made by Pandemic, and yet wasn't included in the series' return.

Allowing two players to use the same screen (what we refer to endearingly as couch co-op) harkens back to the game's original design philosophy and will surely make long-time fans of the series happy. And really, don't we all want to be happy?",techradar
6,Sally Yates to offer first public account of Flynn's Russia contacts,"Sally Yates speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 28, 2016. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Sally Yates largely avoided the public spotlight when she served as deputy attorney general during the final two years of the Obama administration.

That all changed — dramatically — in the 10 days she spent as acting attorney general during the infancy of the Trump administration.

The career federal prosecutor from Georgia, a holdover from the Obama Justice Department, was abruptly fired Jan. 30 for refusing to defend the new president’s controversial travel ban in court.

Yet it is the extraordinary warning she delivered just four days earlier to the White House counsel’s office about former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn that is the reason for her testimony to Congress on Monday.

It's perhaps the most-anticipated congressional hearing since FBI Director James Comey publicly acknowledged last month that the bureau was investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

For the first time publicly, Yates is expected to recount to a Senate panel a Jan. 26 meeting in which she alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that Flynn had lied to administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration. Those misrepresentations, Yates would maintain, made the former Army lieutenant general vulnerable to possible blackmail.

The specter of Yates' testimony was not lost on Trump, who early Monday fired off two tweets distancing the administration from Flynn while suggesting that Yates may have leaked information about her actions related to the former national security adviser.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,'' Trump said. ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council (sic).''

What remains troubling about Flynn's contacts, according to officials who have previously described the communications, was that the former general had talked with the ambassador about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Those conversations were secretly monitored by federal authorities, as are most communications involving foreign diplomats.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The Justice Department has reportedly told Sally Yates that she needs their permission to talk about what she did and heard as acting Attorney General. Matt Hoffman reports. Buzz60

Pence, meanwhile, had said he had been assured by Flynn that the subject of sanctions was not raised in the Kislyak conversations.

Shortly after Yates' warnings were made public, Flynn was forced to resign, ending the shortest tenure of any president's national security adviser – while stoking further suspicion about the ties between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Since then, Flynn and former Trump advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone have become the subjects of fresh scrutiny about their Russian ties.

On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump transition team members had warned Flynn about the risks of communicating with the Russian ambassador, prior to the his December telephone conversations with Kislyak. According to the report, Flynn was told in November that the ambassador's communications were likely being monitored by U.S. authorities.

Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with the House Intelligence Committee are conducting a parallel inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, recently asked the advisers to provide information about their activities.

Flynn also is now under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform Defense Department officials about seeking payments from foreign governments.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is leading Monday's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing, has said the panel's examination is necessary to ""hold [Russia] accountable.''

""Based on evidence presented by our intelligence and law enforcement communities, I believe Russia interfered in our election,'' Graham has said. ""I do not believe it changed the outcome, but I have no doubt they interfered.'' The U.S. intelligence community has accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks to hack Democratic political organizations and release stolen information to undermine confidence in the American election.

It is not immediately clear how much new information Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also is scheduled to testify Monday, will be able provide. Both witnesses are likely to be constrained by the classified nature of the information surrounding the events they were privy to.

In March, when Yates' attorney had notified the Justice Department and White House of her intent to appear at a previously scheduled House Intelligence Committee hearing, the attorney was warned that Yates' testimony could contained privileged communications that might be barred.

Ultimately, Yates' scheduled March 28 appearance was canceled.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer has since indicated that the White House has no objection to Yates' testifying. And last week , Graham signaled that senators will ask Yates about what other possible considerations drove her to alert the White House counsel about her concerns for Flynn.

Responding to a series of questions from Graham, FBI Director James Comey recalled in separate testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he met with Yates to discuss her concerns about Flynn's activities. The meeting occurred after FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Comey declined to elaborate on the meeting with Yates in the open committee session.

Attorneys for Yates and Flynn did not respond to inquiries seeking comment.

Flynn, meanwhile, has sought immunity from any possible prosecution. Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees, in the midst of continuing Russia probes, have indicated that it is too early in their investigations to cut a deal for Flynn's testimony. Separately, preliminary discussions about Flynn's prospects for immunity in the FBI investigation also have yielded no agreement.

However, it is the extraordinary warning she delivered just four days earlier to the White House counsel’s office about former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn that is the reason for her testimony to Congress on Monday. You can watch the hearing live in the player above.

For the first time publicly, Yates is expected to recount to a Senate panel a Jan. 26 meeting in which she alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that Flynn had lied to administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration. Those misrepresentations, Yates would maintain, made the former Army lieutenant general vulnerable to possible blackmail.

In a pointed speech on Sunday, former President Obama took aim at his successor in the White House — and at congressional Republicans who are pushing to repeal his signature health care law.

Speaking at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston as he accepted the annual Profile in Courage Award, Obama noted that in 2010, several lawmakers lost their congressional seats after voting for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These men and women, he said, “did the right thing. Theirs was a profile in courage.”

Obama then told the crowd, “I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn’t take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm — those who often have no access to the corridors of power.”

The speech came just three days after House Republicans narrowly voted to repeal ACA on a 217-213 vote. The measure passed without any support from Democrats and in spite of a handful of ""No"" votes from mostly moderate Republicans. It faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where Republicans hold just a four-seat majority.

Obama warned lawmakers, “I hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what’s politically expedient, but doing what, deep in our hearts, we know is right.”

Recalling the early fights in Congress for ACA at the beginning of his presidency, Obama on Sunday also took a jab at President Trump’s comment to governors last February, when Trump told them, ""Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.""

Obama got a laugh on Sunday, telling the crowd, “There was a reason why healthcare reform had not been accomplished before: it was hard.”

He also indirectly criticized Trump’s efforts to deport millions of illegal immigrants and ban travelers from Muslim-majority countries, warning Americans against “falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don’t look at us, or have the same surnames, or pray the way we do.”

He added, “At such moments, courage is necessary. At such moments we need courage to stand up to hate — not just in others but in ourselves. At such moments we need the courage to stand up to dogma — not just in others but in ourselves.”

Obama also warned against cynicism about our political system, saying: “Justice and freedom and equality and kindness and generosity — it doesn’t happen on its own … We are constantly having to make a choice because progress is fragile.”

One reason Obama received the award, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation noted, was for expanding health security to millions of Americans. Obama joins Republican presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, NBC News reported.

The award is named for a 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by JFK that profiled eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled though unpopular positions. May 29 would have been his 100th birthday.

Obama, 55, thanked Kennedy for leading “with a steady hand” during the Cold War in general and the Cuban Missile Crisis specifically — and for showing his generation that “politics could be a noble and worthwhile pursuit.” He noted that the example of JFK and his brother Robert F. Kennedy “helped guide me into politics.” Their younger brother, longtime Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, “helped make me a better public servant once I arrived in Washington,” Obama said.

At Sunday’s ceremony, Jack Schlossberg, JFK's grandson, introduced Obama, saying, ""Without President Obama, I might still be sitting on my couch eating Doritos and watching sports.""

The former president also thanked former first lady Michelle Obama “for, after the presidency, sticking with me, because I think she felt an obligation to the country to stay on. But once her official duties were over, it wasn’t clear.”

6,Trump names 10 conservatives to federal courts,"President Trump nominated 10 federal court judges Monday at a time when three Supreme Court justices -- including Anthony Kennedy, here with Trump at the swearing-in of newly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch last month -- could be stepping down in the coming years. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA)

WASHINGTON — President Trump borrowed a page from George W. Bush's playbook Monday by nominating 10 federal court judges en masse, almost 16 years to the day that Bush named 11 appeals court judges — including a Washington lawyer named John Roberts who soon became chief justice of the United States.

Trump's action represents the opening salvo in what will be at least four years of battles with Senate Democrats over the federal judiciary, one that the president intends to pack with conservatives after President Barack Obama spent eight years tilting nearly every circuit court to the left.

It also elevates some rising legal stars who made it on to Trump's original list of 21 potential Supreme Court justices last year, putting them closer to the nation's high court at a time when Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's swing vote, is contemplating retirement and two liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are long past the average retirement age.

Two judges from that list were among the 10 nominees named Monday. Joan Larsen, 48, a Michigan Supreme Court justice, was nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. David Stras, 42, a Minnesota Supreme Court justice, was nominated for the 8th Circuit. Previously, federal district court Judge Amul Thapar of Kentucky, who also made Trump's high court list, was nominated to the 6th Circuit.

Others named to federal appeals courts Monday were Notre Dame law professor Amy Coney Barrett, Kentucky lawyer John Bush and former Alabama solicitor general Kevin Newsom. Those named to district courts were Dabney Friedrich, Terry Moorer, David Nye and Scott Palk, while Damien Schiff was named to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

Read more:

Conservative legal activists applauded the new nominees, just as they had Trump's selection in January of federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court seat vacated a year earlier by Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch, 49, was confirmed last month.

""When it comes to fulfilling his campaign promise to appoint strong, principled judges, Trump is knocking it out of the park,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which spent millions of dollars to help win Gorsuch's confirmation.

Combined with Thapar's earlier nomination, Trump now has nominated six people to serve on federal appeals courts, the traditional stepping stones to the Supreme Court. That's one-fourth of the total number of vacancies on those regional courts. Trump's five other nominations Monday were to lower courts.

""The large number of judicial vacancies gives President Trump a historic opportunity to move the federal courts in the right direction -- towards constitutionalism and away from judicial activism -- in just four years,"" said Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice.

It took Obama eight years to liberalize a majority of federal appeals courts. At the end of Bush's presidency, 10 of the 13 circuit courts had a majority of judges nominated by Republican presidents. Today, nine of them have a majority of Democratic presidents' nominees — including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, which will hear oral arguments Monday on the administration's effort to impose a travel ban on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries.

Trump can reverse that advantage in just one term, establishing Republican control over nine appeals courts and leaving three others deadlocked, based on current retirement trends. Only the special appeals court created in 1982 to hear patent and trademark cases would retain a majority of Democratic appointees.

The projected reversal is crucial, because while the Supreme Court hears only about 75 cases each term, the appeals courts hear some 30,000. Only the most significant or divisive find their way to the high court, which has slashed its caseload in recent decades.

Federal appeals courts have played a particularly crucial role in the past year. Scalia's death in February 2016 left the Supreme Court with only eight members. Republicans' refusal to confirm Obama's nominee — Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit court — forced the justices to leave lower court rulings on Obama's immigration plan and the power of labor unions intact following 4-4 votes. Only last month did Gorsuch win confirmation and assume Scalia's seat.

Senate Republicans and Democrats view the appeals courts as so important that confirmation battles have stretched longer than two years and led some nominees to withdraw from consideration. One of those nominated by Bush on May 9, 2001, was Miguel Estrada, considered at the time a potential future Supreme Court nominee. He was blocked by Senate Democrats for more than two years and ultimately withdrew.

The impact of appeals court judges is clear. Judges named by Obama to federal appellate and district courts overseeing North Carolina, Texas, Michigan and Wisconsin voted during the recent political campaign season against restrictions on voting imposed by Republican legislatures. In states where Obama's judges had less influence, such as Ohio and Virginia, courts left restrictions on voting in place.

Looking ahead, Trump's appeals court judges could play major roles in cases testing the ability of religious objectors to sidestep government regulations, as well as cases involving the rights of criminal defendants. The Supreme Court's decision in June striking down abortion restrictions in Texas still leaves appeals courts with the job of deciding which types of limits to permit.

Another major impact Obama had on lower federal courts could be tested under Trump: the increased prevalence of women, minorities, gays and lesbians. About 43% of all his nominees were women and 36% minorities, surpassing previous records under Bill Clinton. Republican presidents have nominated less than half that number.

16,Coach to acquire Kate Spade for $2.4 billion,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a blockbuster deal, Coach will buy Kate Spade for $2.4 billion dollars, in cash. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

Colorado Scenics

Accessories seller Coach said Monday that it had reached a deal to acquire upscale retailer Kate Spade in a shakeup for the luxury goods industry as it grapples with sluggish sales.

Coach said it would pay $2.4 billion for Kate Spade, which it plans to maintain as an independent brand with its own stores.

Kate Spade's connection with Millennials, who represent 60% of its customers, and international growth potential appealed to Coach.

""It is a strong brand with a clear and consistent positioning, with leadership in the attributes of fashionable, fun and feminine, and a growing share of Millennials,"" Coach CEO Victor Luis said in a conference call.

Although Luis said Kate Spade would be afforded the autonomy to make its own design and marketing decisions, he said the company had become ""too dependent"" on online sales and wholesale distribution.

Those channels ""can lead to meaningful brand deterioration over time,"" and Coach will cut back on both, Luis said.

The acquirer said it expects to shed $50 million in annual costs within three years after completing the deal. That will include ""supply chain optimization"" and elimination of overlapping costs, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wills said.

Coach said it had identified global expansion opportunity through opening Kate Spade specialty stores. Globally, Kate Spade has 133 specialty stores, 82 outlet stores and 54 stores similar to franchises exclusively in foreign markets.

The company opened 52 new locations in 2016, which helped boost net income and overall sales.

But sales per square foot at stores open at least a year fell 2.4% in the 12-month period ending Oct. 1, underscoring the retailer's challenges, including a sluggish luxury market, lower growth in China and unfavorable currency rates.

Kate Spade CEO Craig Leavitt told investors that the deal will allow the brand to ""achieve long-term success"" after working ""hard to create a clear and distinct brand identity, differentiated storytelling and great products.""

Luis said there ""may be some slight opportunities"" to close stores in markets where the two retailers compete, ""but we see it as very, very minimal."" He said only 35% of Kate Spade stores overlap with Coach locations.

Among the growth opportunities is China, where only 1% of consumers can name the Kate Spade brand without prompting, while 23% can name the Coach brand, Luis said.

While Kate Spade has been expanding, Coach has been reducing its own retail footprint in North America, where the company closed 30 retail stores in the fiscal year ended July 2.

Coach ended the period with 228 retail stores and 204 outlet stores in North America, 522 Coach locations internationally and 75 Stuart Weitzman stores.

The deal is ""somewhat surprising"" because it comes as Coach's ""turnaround plan seems to be taking hold,"" CFRA Research analyst Tuna Amobi said in a bulletin.

Coach investors applauded the deal, as the company's stock increased 5.5% to $45.01 in mid-morning trading.

Kate Spade had confirmed in February that it was considering ""strategic alternatives,"" as the handbag, clothing, shoes and accessories seller faces a strong U.S. dollar that is dampening foreign tourist spending.

The companies said their boards had unanimously authorized the deal, which they expect to close in the third quarter.

Coach is paying $18.50 per share for Kate Spade. That's 27.5% more than the stock was worth on Dec. 27, before rumors of a possible deal surfaced.

Kate Spade shares rose 8.1% to $18.34 at 9:53 a.m.

CHICAGO — Aaron Hicks slid across home plate, hopped up and flexed his arms in jubilation.

No Monday morning blues for Hicks and the New York Yankees.

Hicks scored on Starlin Castro’s grounder in the 18th inning, and the rolling Yankees beat the Chicago Cubs 5-4 in the majors’ longest interleague game ever by innings.

“We’re going to grind out games,” Hicks said. “We’re going to fight to the end.”

The teams combined for a major league-record 48 strikeouts in baseball’s longest game of the season by innings, wrapping up in a tidy 6 hours, 5 minutes.

“I know we lost, but you’ve got to try to have fun with it,” Cubs slugger Anthony Rizzo said.

Hicks struck out four times, but he came up with a huge play in the final inning. He led off with a bunt single against Pedro Strop (0-2) and advanced to second when catcher Willson Contreras threw the ball into right field for an error.

With one out and Hicks on third, Castro hit a bouncer up the middle. Shortstop Addison Russell tried to throw home, but it was wide and Hicks scored easily.

Chasen Shreve (1-0) pitched three scoreless innings, striking out pinch-hitting pitcher Kyle Hendricks with runners on first and second for the final out in New York’s fifth straight win. The Yankees (20-9) improved to 19-5 since they opened the season with four losses in five games. They also matched their high-water mark from last season at 11 games over. 500.

“It’s just a crazy game,” manager Joe Girardi said.

Chicago trailed 4-1 before it rallied in the ninth against Aroldis Chapman, who helped the Cubs win the World Series last year for the first time since 1908. Albert Almora Jr. and Javier Baez each singled in a run before Chapman hit slumping slugger Anthony Rizzo on his left forearm with the bases loaded on his 36th pitch, forcing home the tying run.

Rizzo got an X-ray on his arm and it came back negative.

“Thank my parents I drank my milk when I was a kid,” Rizzo said. “Decent bones.”

Tyler Clippard then came in and got Ben Zobrist to bounce to second for the final out. It was Chapman’s first blown save since Game 7 at Cleveland.

“I felt normal. It just wasn’t my night tonight,” Chapman said through a translator.

Before Hicks scampered home with the winning run, the biggest highlight of extra innings belonged to Cubs slugger Kyle Schwarber. The left fielder went into the stands in foul territory for an outstanding catch on Chase Headley’s foul popup in the 12th.

“Tremendous play,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.

What was left of the crowd also sung along when the Cubs showed a tape of Harry Caray singing “Take Me Out To The Ball Game” for the second seventh-inning stretch in the 14th.

Jacoby Ellsbury hit a two-run homer for New York, and Aaron Judge had a run-scoring triple. Ellsbury went 2 for 6 in his first start since he bruised a nerve in his left elbow last Monday.

Baez homered for the Cubs, and Schwarber doubled twice. Jon Lester struck out nine in seven sharp innings in his 30th career start against New York.

Luis Severino had a similar line for New York, bouncing back nicely from a shaky start against Toronto last Monday. The right-hander allowed one run and four hits in seven innings.

Worth noting

The Yankees set franchise strikeout records for pitching with 26 and hitting with 22 Ks. The previous single-game records were 19 for pitching and 17 for batting.

Trainer's room

Cubs: OF Jason Heyward was out of the starting lineup for the second straight day with a sore knuckle on his right hand. … LHP Brett Anderson was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a lower back strain. The Cubs also optioned LHP Rob Zastryzny to Triple-A Iowa and recalled RHP reliever Justin Grimm and INF Tommy La Stella from their top farm club.

Up next

Yankees: Masahiro Tanaka (4-1, 4.46 ERA) gets the ball Monday for the opener of a two-game set in Cincinnati. He faces fellow right-hander Rookie Davis (1-1, 7.36 ERA), who was acquired by the Reds when they traded Aroldis Chapman to the Yankees in December 2015.

Cubs: Jake Arrieta (4-1, 4.63 ERA) starts for the Cubs on Monday in the opener of a three-game series at Colorado. Right-hander Antonio Senzatela (4-1, 2.84 ERA) pitches for the Rockies.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's second travel ban targeting immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries begins a new round of federal court hearings Monday battling a familiar Achilles' heel: Candidate Trump.

From Richmond, Va., to Seattle, Wash., federal appeals courts with a majority of judges nominated by Democratic presidents will hear government lawyers defend the revised ban against immigrants and refugees as Trump's national security prerogative.

Civil liberties and immigrants' rights groups will contend that the new executive order continues to discriminate against Muslims based on their religion, a violation of the First Amendment's establishment clause -- and they will use Trump's words from the campaign trail as Exhibit A.

It was still 2015 when Trump -- before any votes had been cast in primaries and caucuses — called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.""

More:Refugee admissions plummet under Trump

Those and subsequent comments by Trump and his associates have been used by challengers to prove that regardless of other reasons, the travel ban represents an unconstitutional violation of religious rights.

But unlike the first round of court battles in February, which sent the White House back to the drawing board to draft a new executive order, administration officials and their allies have reason to believe they are on firmer legal ground now.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The president's previous executive order on immigration was suspended by federal judges. Time

Travel ban 2.0 exempts thousands of foreign nationals who hold valid visas or green cards. It eliminates Iraq from the original list of affected countries, leaving Iran, Libya, Somalis, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It lasts for 90 days, not indefinitely, as had been the case for Syria. It contains no preference for religious minorities, which had favored Christians. And it includes a waiver process for those claiming undue hardship.

""On its face, it doesn't target Muslims,"" says Christopher Hajec, litigation director for the conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute. ""The political branches of our government have the sovereign right to protect the country.""

TRUMP V. TRUMP

(Photo: JOSHUA LOTT, AFP/Getty Images)

Challengers say targeting Muslims is exactly what the travel ban does, and they cite Trump's words as proof.

""President Trump publicly committed himself to an indefensible goal: banning Muslims from coming to the United States,"" the American Civil Liberties Union and National Immigration Law Center argue in court papers. ""The president refused to repudiate that goal on multiple occasions, including after he was elected, and he continues to advertise it to this day on his own website.""

Karen Tumlin, NILC's legal director, says that violates the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion and gives Muslim Americans ""a constant feeling that the highest office in the land is disparaging their religious choice.""

Read more:

The government insists the impetus for both versions of the travel ban is the same: national security. Every president for the past three decades has temporarily suspended entry of some aliens, it says. Near the end of the Obama administration, it notes, immigrants from the same six nations were blocked temporarily under the visa waiver program because of concerns about terrorism.

That argument didn't work the first time around in February. A federal district court judge in Washington State and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit stopped the ban in its tracks -- after a chaotic first few days at international airports and a round of visa cancellations by the State Department.

Version 2.0 didn't fare much better in March. This time, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland got in the way, just as the ban was about to go into effect. In Hawaii, Judge Derrick Watson cited ""significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus"" toward Muslims. In Maryland, Judge Theodore Chuang said the ""history of public statements"" indicated the purpose was ""the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.”

Thomas Lee, an international law professor at Fordham University School of Law, says the second executive order stands a better chance of being upheld but remains burdened by the earlier anti-Muslim rhetoric.

""They can’t completely disavow the past statements,"" Lee says. ""You can't put that genie back in the bottle.""

LAST STOP: SUPREME COURT?

The government and conservative interest groups backing it say statements Trump made when he was not president are largely irrelevant. ""Even in the domestic setting, courts judge the legitimacy of a law by what it says and does, and occasionally by the official context that surrounds it — not by what supposedly lies in the hearts of its drafters,"" the government's brief says.

That may not be enough to convince the judges hearing the cases on Monday in Richmond and the following week in Seattle. Both courts are among the most liberal in the country.

The Richmond hearing will be held in front of the entire 15-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which is extremely unusual. Appeals court cases usually go before three-judge panels; the full court only rarely agrees to hear cases even after a panel rules.

“It’s been more than half a century since the court has done it,” Tumlin says. “It’s a bit of a legal unicorn. You don’t get this very often.”

If both the 4th and 9th Circuit appeals courts rule against Trump, he will get one final chance if the Supreme Court agrees to weigh in. The high court, now at full strength with the addition of Trump's nominee, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, has divided closely in the past on issues involving immigration.

Last June, it deadlocked 4-4 over President Barack Obama's effort to protect more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to seek work permits. The tie vote left a lower court ruling against the program intact.

But the justices often defer to the president and executive branch on issues involving national security.

“If I were a betting man,"" Lee says, ""I would bet that the government wins.”

Pulmonary congestion is a possible cause of Olympic bobsledder Steven Holcomb’s death on Saturday, USA Bobsled & Skeleton announced on Sunday.

The results of a preliminary report by the Adirondack Medical Center revealed the potential cause, pending toxicology performed by an independent laboratory. The preliminary report was negative for drugs, and USA Bobsled said there is no suspicion of foul play.

Holcomb, 37, was found to have died in his sleep at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid on Saturday.

Holcomb won Olympic gold in 2010, piloting the “Night Train” to win the first U.S. gold medal in the four-man bobsled since 1948. In Sochi, Holcomb won bronze medals in the two-man and four-man bobsled.

""Our deepest sympathies go out to the family, friends and teammates of our dear friend Steven Holcomb,"" said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Board of Directors Chairman Pete Piechoski.

For these 10 veterans, that’s not a good sign. They could be very much in danger of losing their jobs to incoming rookies from the 2017 draft class. It’ll take strong play in training camp for them to remain atop the depth chart.",fox-sports
9,MLB Power Rankings: How far can the Cubs and Giants fall? | FOX Sports,"The San Francisco Giants were something close to a dynasty at the beginning of the decade — the Chicago Cubs entered this season thinking that they might be the next great baseball dynasty.

It's May — there's a ton of baseball left this season — but right now two of baseball's blue bloods are spilling.

The Cubs are playing mediocre baseball, buoyed by a mediocre starting pitching staff. The Giants are just plain bad, having been swept in emphatic fashion by the surprising (but not that surprising) Reds.

When will these two teams get it together? Only time will tell. For now, they're in places no one expected them to be in the Power Rankings.

9,Is it even possible to enforce a lifetime stadium ban? | FOX Sports,"Last week, Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones blasted the concept of stadium bans, referring to such suspensions as a “slap on the wrist” following the team’s May 1 game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.

According to Jones, fans at the historic ballpark taunted him with racial epithets during the Orioles’ 5-2 win, with one throwing a bag of peanuts at Jones as he made his way to the dugout.

Red Sox president Sam Kennedy told MassLive.com that 34 fans were removed from the game, including 20 who were tossed for alcohol-related reasons. It’s unclear how many of those ejected engaged in the reported abuse of Jones — or how many fans are kicked out of an average game — but the Boston Globe reported that one fan was banned for life by the stadium.

Regardless, Jones argued that neither penalty is harsh enough to end the behavior.

“It’s pathetic,” Jones said, according to USA Today. “It’s called a coward. What they need to do is that instead of kicking them out of the stadium, they need to fine them 10 grand, 20 grand, 30 grand. Something that really hurts somebody. Make them pay in full. And if they don’t, take it out of their check.

“That’s how you hurt somebody,” the five-time All-Star continued. “You suspend them from the stadium, what does that mean?”

According to experts in the field, it doesn’t necessarily mean much — and while bans are usually effective, they aren’t a foolproof way to keep troublesome fans from returning, especially if they’re determined to get back in.

Different states, leagues and teams have varying policies, but typically speaking, a violator facing a stadium ban is forced to sign paperwork before leaving the building agreeing to their own prohibition. In addition, any future tickets purchased by that fan are voided, and should that person return while the ban is still in place, he or she would be subject to arrest for criminal trespass.

However, while the threat of incarceration is certainly a deterrent, enforcement can be challenging.

USA TODAY Sports/Ron Chenoy

“(Looking out for) ejected fans is a priority,” said Dan Donovan, vice president of security and technology consulting for Guidepost Solutions. “But those guards’ biggest priority is that the screening process is being done correctly and that we don’t have prohibited items coming into the facility.”

To help catch banned spectators, ballparks, stadiums and arenas will often distribute images of banned fans to security staff. But while employees remain mindful of blacklisted fans attempting to attend a game undetected, those faces can be tough to spot among the thousands who flood the building’s gates.

“Security and guest services are there to make the event enjoyable,” sports security expert James DeMeo, founder of Unified Sports & Entertainment Security Consulting, said. “But they also obviously have that duty of care to make sure the fans are safe.

“On ingress, metal (detectors) and screening measures are really important in terms of staff having that situational awareness to look for potentially troubled or dangerous fans before they come into the venue,” DeMeo added. “But the key is for the staff to know the signs to look for with a disgruntled or agitated fan.”

At the University of Southern Mississippi, students and faculty at the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security work specifically toward the goal of improving security at sporting events. Launched in 2006 on a grant from the Department of Homeland Security, the Center researches the impact of spectator-related incidents nationwide and has provided training and certification to more than 5,000 security professionals and nearly 1,000 universities.

USA TODAY Sports/Mark J. Rebilas

“We constantly look at people, processes and technologies to see if we can try to solve problems,” Lou Marciani, the Center’s director, told FOX Sports. “This incident in Boston will trigger new best practices, it will trigger new rules and regulations from the leagues, and it will drive technology to the lab here, so we can begin to, long-term, solve the problem.

“And that’s really what the center does,” Marciani added. “We’re on the back end of things to make things better down the road.”

Another approach that could take the pressure off hired personnel and help nab unwanted fans is the use of facial-recognition programs and other biometric software, but implementing that emerging technology is costly and is far from a cure-all.

“In order to do facial recognition, first of all I have to have a good, clear picture (of the subject),” Donovan said. “Then I load the picture into my system, I’ve got a database of known offenders, and certain cameras, when set up correctly, are fixed on a focus area, and you can run facial recognition off of that and flag those people.

USA TODAY Sports/David Butler II

“This isn’t Jack Bauer in ‘24’ though,” Donovan continued. “You’re not just pulling these faces off any old camera in the stadium. So it’s an investment for the stadium operator, the team, in order to add this capability for the number of doors, the possible entry points to their perimeter. And every building is different.”

With time, such systems will become more commonplace — ”I think it’s coming,” Donovan said, “and it’s going to come quickly” — but for now the onus still rests largely on the security and guest services representatives manning the building’s front line.

Fortunately for the teams and leagues that occupy these spaces, simply asking fans to leave and not come back is almost always enough to keep them away from good.

“Usually the trespass warning cures the situation,” said Ed Boyens, security manager for the City of Orlando venues division, which oversees operations at Amway Center and Camping World Stadium. “And it’s very rare that we do see somebody come back.”

9,This guy looks like Lionel Messi so much that police detained him to stop fan frenzy | FOX Sports,"No, Lionel Messi wasn’t just hanging out in the city of Hamadan, Iran over the weekend. It was a guy who looked just like him — and for a lot of fans, it was tough to tell the difference.

Reza Parastesh, a 25-year-old who looks a lot like Messi, has embraced his doppelganger looks by growing out his beard and rocking a No. 10 Barcelona shirt. According to AFP, police took the student to the police station and impounded his car to clear up commotion he caused.

“Now people really see me as the Iranian Messi and want me to mimic everything he does,” Parastesh told AFP. When I show up somewhere, people are really shocked. I’m really happy that seeing me makes them happy and this happiness gives me a lot of energy.”

It all started with Parastesh’s father, noticing the resemblance, convinced his son to try on a Barcelona shirt to see how it looked. Parastesh seemed to think he was onto something and started growing out his beard, too.

It looks like it could turn lucrative for the lookalike — he has gotten media interviews and contract offers to model. The problem for Parastesh right now is that he can’t do any tricks with a soccer ball, but he’s working on that. If Messi is up for it, however, Parastesh is willing to help him out off the pitch.

“Being the best player in footballing history, he definitely has more work than he can handle. I could be his representative when he is too busy,” he said.

9,"Chelsea's N'Golo Kante picks up another award, named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year | FOX Sports","N’Golo Kante has been voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers’ Association, just shading his Chelsea teammate Eden Hazard in the voting.

Just like the voting for last month’s Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year award, Kante and Hazard trotted into first and second, taking a combined 65 percent of the votes. Tottenham’s Dele Alli, the reigning PFA Young Player of the Year, finished third, some distance behind the two Chelsea men.

A record 17 different players received votes, with five players from Chelsea receiving recognition in Kante, Hazard, David Luiz, Diego Costa and Cesar Azpilicueta.

Upon receiving the award, Kante said: “It is a fantastic honor to win this award. With so many great players in this Chelsea squad and in the Premier League, for the Football Writers’ Association to name me their Footballer of the Year is a very proud moment in my career.”

FWA Chairman Patrick Barclay added: “N’Golo Kante could not be a more deserving winner of English football’s most prestigious individual award.

“In the view of some FWA members, he would have been a worthy recipient last season for his contribution to Leicester’s title success, but the almost unbroken excellent form of Chelsea since he changed clubs has left little room for further debate.

“Considering the competition of Eden Hazard and other players from Chelsea in particular, this is a great achievement.”

In 69 years, Kante is just the fourth Chelsea player to be voted FWA Footballer of the Year, alongside Gianfranco Zola in 1997, Frank Lampard in 2005 and Hazard in 2015. Kante is the last Frenchman to win the award since Arsenal’s legendary striker Thierry Henry won it back in 2006.",fox-sports
9,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coming back to Chicagoland | FOX Sports,"The Heroes in a Half Shell are headed back to Chicagoland Speedway and the opening race of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoff season.

The Sept. 17 Cup race at Chicagoland will be dubbed the Tales of the Turtles 400 and it will kick off NASCAR’s 10-race, season-ending playoffs.

The return engagement means fans will see a lot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-themed activities on race weekend, including a fan meet-and-greet with the Turtles and a ticket package that includes a Tales of the Turtles DVD.

In an exclusive interview with FOXSports.com, track president Scott Paddock said he was pleased that Nickelodeon agreed to bring the Turtles franchise back for a second season after a successful partnership last season when the race was called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 400.

“We’re thrilled because media companies like Nickelodeon are very activation-savvy,” Paddock told FOXSports.com. “They’re very promotional oriented. So when you have an entitlement partner like that allocates a lot of resources on promoting your event and secondly, doing a lot on-site that really enhances the guest experience, that’s a huge benefit from our end.”

Paddock said that in addition to having the Turtles at the track, he expects Nickelodeon to bring other on-air talents to the facility. There’s also Turtle-themed NASCAR merchandise already available through the NASCAR.com superstore.

Last year, eight vehicles in NASCAR’s top-three divisions carried special Turtles paint schemes during the Chicagoland weekend and Paddock expects this year will produce another eight to 10 special paint schemes.

Being the first race of the NASCAR playoffs helps, and so does the location.

“It differentiates us in terms of the 36-race schedule,” Paddock said of the track’s race date.

“I think the (NASCAR) industry loves coming to Chicago,” said Paddock. “So I think that’s been a boon. And as I like to say, big events become even bigger in a market like Chicago.”

And since it is the first playoff race, having NASCAR’s support helps, too.

“NASCAR has recognized that a good, successful kickoff to the playoffs typically has a healthy halo effect on the remaining nine races,” said Paddock. “So they have tended to invest resources in Chicago for a successful kickoff. We and are partners have benefitted from that as well.”

9,"Raptors All-Star Kyle Lowry says he'll opt out of contract, become a free agent | FOX Sports","One day after the Toronto Raptors’ season ended with a four-game sweep against the Cleveland Cavaliers, All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry confirmed to reporters Monday that he will opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer.

Expected as it was, Kyle Lowry made it official this AM in Toronto, telling local reporters: ""I will be opting out"" to become a free agent — Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) May 8, 2017

The decision isn’t a surprise given that Lowry, 31, has been an All-Star three times since he re-upped with Toronto for three years with an option for a fourth in 2014. He was set to be paid $12 million for each year of that contract, and it’s possible that he could get a max deal from the Raptors or another team after opting out.

Lowry averaged a career-high 22.4 points and 4.8 rebounds to go along with 7.0 assists for a Raptors team that finished third in the East with a 51-31 record. He missed Games 3 and 4 against the Cavaliers with a sprained ankle and now must decide whether he wants to continue to fall short against Cleveland in the NBA playoffs or take his chances with another team. The Cavs have eliminated the Raptors each of the past two years, and this year the series wasn’t even close.",fox-sports

Reinheimer said he wasn’t sure what to do when he spotted the snake, so he consulted the first-base umpire.

“I don’t know if we’re supposed to try and pick it up and get it off the field,” Reinheimer told MiLB.com, “But I’m not laying out for a ball if it’s right there.”

The River Cats’ social media account sarcastically cried foul on the incident, insinuating that the snake was used as a scare tactic by the Aces, who happen to be the minor-league affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks.

9,Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s dad ends up in custody en route to Victory Lane at Talladega | FOX Sports,"Ricky Stenhouse Jr. had all of his closest family and friends waiting for him in Victory Lane to celebrate his first career win in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series on Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway.

That is, everyone except his father, Ricky Stenhouse Sr.

Stenhouse Sr. watched his son pass Kyle Busch for the lead and hold him off for the victory from his motorhome, which was located behind the Alabama Gang Superstretch of the 2.66-mile track.

When Stenhouse Jr. crossed the finish line, Stenhouse Sr. wanted to get to his son so bad, he tried climbing the backstretch fence when he realized there was no way to get across the track.

That’s when all the trouble started, which was best described by Talladega Superspeedway public relations director, Russell Branham, who quickly chimed in and explained the entire situation during the winner’s press conference in the media center.

“He (Stenhouse Sr.) was extremely excited about his son winning today, and naturally so, Branham said. “His son wins the race, he goes down, he tries to find a way to get across the track. He tried to climb the fence, found out he couldn’t. He begins running down outside of the perimeter road of Turn 3 outside the venue. He wants to go through the tunnel and get in here. Our guys saw it, naturally they stopped him, asked him who he was, said would you get in the car.”

“They placed him in the car and talked to him,” he added. “They said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I’m Ricky Stenhouse’s father.’ (Security then said) Hold on one second, sir. Let me call the director of security. (They) called our security, and our security guy said, ‘Take him to Victory Lane, and that’s what happened.’”

This isn’t the first time Stenhouse Sr. has climbed the fence at a NASCAR track. After Stenhouse Jr.’s first ARCA Series win at Kentucky Speedway in 2008, the two climbed the backstretch fence to meet up and celebrate.

“My dad has done so much for me in my career,” Stenhouse Jr. said. “Making sure that you have the right people around you is one of the things that he’s all about — making sure that you have people that respect you, that will do anything for you, and man, he sacrificed a lot for me and my career.”

With his first career victory, Stenhouse Jr. is now eligible to automatically compete in this year’s NASCAR All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 20.

Stenhouse Jr. credits his father for helping him achieve his racing dreams.

“Everything that I know about racing I learned from him,” Stenhouse Jr. said. “I’m glad that he was able to be here in Victory Lane.”

6,Sally Yates warned White House that Michael Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail,"Sally Yates speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 28, 2016. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she was so concerned that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with the Russian ambassador that she met twice with the White House counsel – including a discussion at one point about possible about criminal charges.

For the first time publicly, Yates recounted to a Senate panel a Jan. 26 meeting – and a follow up meeting the next day – in which she alerted White House Counsel Don McGahn that Flynn had lied to administration officials about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration. Those misrepresentations, Yates would maintain, made the former Army lieutenant general vulnerable to possible blackmail.

""You don’t want a situation where a national security adviser could get blackmailed by the Russians,’’ Yates told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.

The specter of Yates' testimony was not lost on Trump, who early Monday fired off two tweets distancing the administration from Flynn while suggesting that Yates may have leaked information about her actions related to the former national security adviser.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,'' Trump said. ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council (sic).''

Trump and Obama administration officials also confirmed Monday that Obama advised Trump not to hire Flynn during their post-election White House meeting.

What remains troubling about Flynn's contacts, according to officials who have previously described the communications, was that the former general had talked with the ambassador about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Those conversations were secretly monitored by federal authorities, as are most communications involving foreign diplomats.

Pence, meanwhile, had said he had been assured by Flynn that the subject of sanctions was not raised in the Kislyak conversations.

Shortly after Yates' warnings were made public, Flynn was forced to resign, ending the shortest tenure of any president's national security adviser – while stoking further suspicion about the ties between Trump associates and Russian officials.

Since then, Flynn and former Trump advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone have become the subjects of fresh scrutiny about their Russian ties.

On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Trump transition team members had warned Flynn about the risks of communicating with the Russian ambassador, prior to the his December telephone conversations with Kislyak. According to the report, Flynn was told in November that the ambassador's communications were likely being monitored by U.S. authorities.

Separately, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with the House Intelligence Committee are conducting a parallel inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, recently asked the advisers to provide information about their activities.

Flynn also is now under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform Defense Department officials about seeking payments from foreign governments.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is leading Monday's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing, has said the panel's examination is necessary to ""hold [Russia] accountable.''

""Based on evidence presented by our intelligence and law enforcement communities, I believe Russia interfered in our election,'' Graham has said. ""I do not believe it changed the outcome, but I have no doubt they interfered.'' The U.S. intelligence community has accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks to hack Democratic political organizations and release stolen information to undermine confidence in the American election.

It is not immediately clear how much new information Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also is scheduled to testify Monday, will be able provide. Both witnesses are likely to be constrained by the classified nature of the information surrounding the events they were privy to.

In March, when Yates' attorney had notified the Justice Department and White House of her intent to appear at a previously scheduled House Intelligence Committee hearing, the attorney was warned that Yates' testimony could contained privileged communications that might be barred.

Ultimately, Yates' scheduled March 28 appearance was canceled.

Trump spokesman Sean Spicer has since indicated that the White House has no objection to Yates' testifying. And last week , Graham signaled that senators will ask Yates about what other possible considerations drove her to alert the White House counsel about her concerns for Flynn.

Responding to a series of questions from Graham, FBI Director James Comey recalled in separate testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he met with Yates to discuss her concerns about Flynn's activities. The meeting occurred after FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Comey declined to elaborate on the meeting with Yates in the open committee session.

Attorneys for Yates and Flynn did not respond to inquiries seeking comment.

Flynn, meanwhile, has sought immunity from any possible prosecution. Both the House and Senate Intelligence committees, in the midst of continuing Russia probes, have indicated that it is too early in their investigations to cut a deal for Flynn's testimony. Separately, preliminary discussions about Flynn's prospects for immunity in the FBI investigation also have yielded no agreement.

President Trump will soon have his younger and less visible daughter, Tiffany Trump, close by in Washington. She's been admitted to Georgetown Law, located just blocks from the White House.

Tiffany Trump, 23, the daughter of the president and his second wife, Marla Maples, will start at the law school of Georgetown University in the fall, confirmed Mimi Koumanelis, a spokeswoman for the Catholic university.

The main campus is in the Georgetown section of Washington, west of the White House, but the law school is about 15 blocks east of the White House.

Tiffany's presence in Washington will put three of the Trump children (and three grandchildren) in the capital by the fall: Older half-sister Ivanka Trump and her family are living there; she and her husband, Jared Kushner, are senior advisers to the president.

Trump's youngest child, Barron, 11, son of his third wife, first lady Melania Trump, will be moving to Washington with her sometime in June after the end of his school year. The president recently told Bloomberg they had found a school for the youngster but didn't say which one.

The president's two older sons, from his first marriage to Ivana Trump, Donald Jr. and Eric, remain in New York where they are running the Trump real-estate empire.

Tiffany, born in Palm Beach, Fla., but raised mostly in California with her mother, is a 2016 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, from which Ivanka Trump, 35, graduated after transferring there from Georgetown University. Eric Trump also is a graduate of Georgetown University.

The younger Trump daughter was less visible in 2016 until relatively late in the campaign, mostly because she was still an undergrad. After the election, she attended the inauguration, has been seen at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, and turned up for the fun during the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 17, with her boyfriend, Ross Mechanic.

Most recently, the young couple attended a Trump dinner Thursday on the USS Intrepid, docked on the Hudson River in New York, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the World War II Battle of Coral Sea with the prime minister of Australia.

She and Maples and Mechanic also were spotted during New York Fashion Week in February, in the front row for the Fall/Winter 2017 show of Chinese designer Taoray Wang, who designed her white dress and matching coat for Inauguration Day.

A representative of the Trump Organization has not yet responded to a request for comment from USA TODAY.

Tropical Cyclone Donna, packing 120-mph winds, is bearing down on the French territory of New Caledonia in the south Pacific.

On Sunday, as its winds soared to 130 mph, Donna became the most powerful tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere in the month of May, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach.

As of midday Monday U.S. time, the storm was the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale and was moving to the southeast at 9 mph. Tropical cyclones are the same types of storms as hurricanes or typhoons.

By Tuesday into Wednesday, local time, the center of Donna should pass near New Caledonia, bringing flooding rain, possible landslides, coastal flooding and damaging winds, the Weather Channel warned.

Schools in New Caledonia were closed for a public holiday on Monday and would stay shut on Tuesday, Reuters said.

New Caledonia is more than 1,000 miles east of Australia.

Late last week, Donna downed trees and destroyed a church and many homes as it barreled through Vanuatu's far northern province of Torba, World Vision reported.

Donna will never again be the name of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean as it was retired from use following Hurricane Donna's violent rampage up the U.S. East Coast in 1960.

WASHINGTON – Former President Obama warned his successor Donald Trump against hiring Michael Flynn as national security adviser because of his ties to Russian officials, officials in both camps said Monday.

The warning came just two days after the presidential election, during the incoming president's meeting with Obama in the Oval Office on Nov. 10.

Despite Obama's warnings, Trump appointed Flynn as national security adviser anyway – and dismissed him less than a month into his presidency, saying that Flynn misled the White House about his conversations with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump's inauguration.

Though he did not comment in detail about the Oval Office meeting, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Obama made it clear that ""he wasn’t exactly a fan of Gen. Flynn’s.""

That ""shouldn't come as a surprise,"" Spicer said, noting the outgoing president had fired Flynn as the head of the military's intelligence unit. If Obama was so concerned, he should have suspended Flynn's security clearance when he had the authority to do so, Spicer added.

A former aide to President Obama also confirmed the warning, first reported by NBC News.

Another Trump official who confirmed the warning also requested anonymity in order to discuss the private conversation between Obama and Trump, and because of the sensitivity of discussing Flynn, currently the subject of ongoing federal investigations over his contacts with Russians.

During the November meeting, that official said, Obama seemed aware of Flynn's contacts with the Russians, including a 2015 trip to Moscow.

For his part, Trump has defended Flynn and questioned why the Obama administration allowed the former Army lieutenant general to have a security clearance.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,"" Trump tweeted Monday.

The news of Obama's warnings broke shortly before ex-Justice Department official Sally Yates is expected to testify before a Senate panel about her own warnings that Flynn had lied to administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.

Flynn, who spoke with Kislyak before Trump took office, initially denied talking with the ambassador about sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia over its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Flynn later acknowledged that the subject may have surfaced in a phone conversation.

Last month, FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau was investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials during the election.

Flynn, whose conversations with the ambassador fueled suspicion about inappropriate contact between the Trump team and Russia, is also under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform the Defense Department about accepting payments from foreign governments without the required prior approval. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment.

On Monday, Spicer said Trump stands by his decisions to hire Flynn and then later to dismiss him.

Though he didn’t mention him by name, much of former President Barack Obama’s speech when he accepted a Profile in Courage Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library on Sunday evening seemed aimed at President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress who are attempting to dismantle Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. Here of some of his more biting quotes, most of which appear directed at Trump as well as in defense of Obamacare:

***

About members of Congress who voted to pass the ACA during his presidency, only to lose their seat in later elections.

“They had a chance to insure millions. But this vote could also cost them their seats, perhaps end their political careers. … These men and women did the right thing. They did the hard thing. … Their desire to retain a reputation for integrity was stronger than a desire to remain in office.”

***

About today’s members of Congress:

“It is my fervent hope and the hope of millions ... [that] such courage is still possible, that today’s members of Congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth, even when it contradicts party positions.”

***

Describing those in a Boston cancer ward (before the ACA), as told to him by Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose son Ted Jr. was being treated there:

“These parents lived in constant fear of what might happen if they could not afford the next treatment, some calculating in their own minds what they might have to sell or borrow just to make it for a few more months. Some bargaining with God for whatever they could get.”

***

About leadership:

“Any fool can be fearless. Courage, true courage, derives from that senses that of who we are. What are our best selves? What are our most important commitments?”

“It doesn’t take a whole load of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require courage to champion the vulnerable, and the sick, and the infirm. Those who have no access to the corridors of power.”

“That very Kennedy-esque idea that America is not the project of only one person but that each of us can make a difference and all of us ought to try.”

***

On immigrants and immigration:

I think of … every American who stands up for immigrants because they know that their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents were immigrants too. And they know that America is an idea that only grows stronger with each person who adopts our common creed.”

***

About diversity and tolerance:

“Everywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe, clan and anger at those who don’t look like us, have the same surnames or pray the way we do. … At such moments we need courage to stand up to hate, not just in others but within ourselves. At such moments we need the courage to stand up to dogma, not just in others but within ourselves.”

16,5 things to know about the new 'King Arthur' starring Charlie Hunnam,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Charlie Hunnam had a few surprises while filming 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' and 'The Lost City of Z.' He shares his behind-the-scenes stories with USA TODAY's Andrea Mandell. Dan MacMedan for USA TODAY

Charlie Hunnam claims Arthur's birthright in 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.' (Photo: Daniel Smith, Warner Bros.)

There’s a new king carrying Excalibur’s sword. This weekend, Charlie Hunnam will be crowned in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (in theaters Friday), a new take on the Merlin legend from director Guy Ritchie.

Five things you need to know about the big-budget spectacle:

This is an origin story.

In the supernatural-infused reboot, Arthur’s father (Eric Bana) is wrestled from his throne by his murderous brother Vortigern (Jude Law). Young Arthur escapes and is raised as an orphan in a brothel, where he takes up the life of a thief. A decade later, thanks to Vortigern's paranoid edict forcing all young men in the kingdom be tested on their ability to wrest the sword from the stone, Arthur's birthright proves hard to avoid. “One of the big problems with the Arthurian legend is it’s so sprawling,” says Hunnam, 37. “So what Guy had wanted to do, very smartly, was just tell the first chapter of the story.”

Charlie Hunnam is equipped for mega-fame, says director Guy Ritchie. (Photo: Chris Young, AP)

Charlie Hunnam has been ready for years.

The British actor launched his 2017 silver-screen offensive last month with The Lost City of Z, rose to fame as a dangerous biker on Sons of Anarchy and infamously pulled out as the lead in Fifty Shades of Grey. He moved to Hollywood 20 years ago to launch his career. “It’s not like he’s new to any of this,” says Ritchie, adding that he’s “seldom met anyone as level-headed as (Charlie). ... Any degree of fame is not going to corrupt him. He’s pretty solid.”

Um, he’s really, really ripped in the role.

Let’s just say Hunnam didn’t have much work to do to get in shape for King Arthur. “He never seems to carry more than 6% body fat,” says Ritchie with mock annoyance. Hunnam’s routine? “I did some Thai boxing, Jiu-Jitsu,” he told Kristen Bell when she filled in on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last week. “I set myself a goal of doing 1,000 push-ups a day minimum for six months. I’m a little bit crazy so if there was a day that I didn’t get the thousand, I would punish myself and have to do 2,000 the next day. You've got to get after it. Eye of the tiger!”

More 'Arthur' could be on the way.

Hunnam has signed on for more installments, should the box office be fruitful. Is he up for it? “Absolutely,” he says. ""I grew up on (1981's) Excalibur. I must have watched it four dozen times. It’s one of the great stories. I would hope (future movies) would be with Guy. That’s always the roll of the dice for an actor who signs on to these type of things.""

Yes, that’s David Beckham with the bad teeth.

Look closely: Beckham has a cameo as a soldier watching as Hunnam attempts to pull Excalibur from its stubborn resting place. How could you miss him? Well, Ritchie decorated his famous friend in a prosthetic nose, facial scars and rotted teeth. “I sat next to him as he was watching his bit, and I could feel him shrinking in his chair,"" says Ritchie with a laugh, who last hired Beckham to appear as a movie projectionist in 2015’s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. “He’s the most wonderful man."" For the record, Beckham was cool with masking his famous visage. ""That’s the only way it can work,"" Ritchie says. ""If there’s too much good-looking Beckham going on, he could distract you.""

4,"This High School Is Refusing To Acknowledge A Dead Student During Graduation Because They Want A 'Happy, Vibrant Feel'","In the email that Michelle Rosoff shared on her Facebook page, the principal, Will Chavis, said that ""a memorial of a lost/loved one has the potential to cause students (or others) to react in ways that would take trained professionals (i.e. counselors) to support — we cannot ensure that at such an occasion.""

Michelle Rosoff said the school didn't need therapists on hand in the middle of a graduation. ""I'm a therapist, that's what I do for a living. If they need therapists, I'll bring a whole shitload of therapists,"" she said.

In an email to BuzzFeed News, Lisa Luten, a spokeswoman for Wake County Schools, said that the decision not to have a memorial for Rachel during graduation was made by administration officials, counseling staff, and school psychologists ""based on guidelines recommended by National Association of School Psychologists.""

However, some of Rachel's friends want her to be remembered at their graduation ceremony.

""I think we are old enough to be okay and understand what is going on,"" Alissa Brasington, Rachel's friend, told WRAL.com. ""I think we'll be okay if they mention her. It will actually be better than if they don't mention her.""

Her best friend, Victoria Ward, who is graduating in June, told ABC 11, ""I think it's more of a sad thing that they can't recognize her. She should be there with us.""

Luten said that ""Rachel will be remembered and recognized during Enloe High School's Senior Awards event. A scholarship will be presented in her name at that event.""

Students and teachers had also installed a bench on campus in Rachel's honor.

Michelle Rosoff told BuzzFeed News that she had started the $500 scholarship in Rachel's name. A link to the scholarship is on the school's website.

""They can take my money now that I'm funding them for a scholarship and they can have her name on the website but they don't want to acknowledge her at graduation,"" she said.",buzzfeed
4,17 Poop Emergencies That Will Make You Laugh And Cringe,"We asked members of the BuzzFeed Community to tell us their grossest, funniest vacation poop stories. Here are some of our favorites.

1. The beach bum poop: ""Two years ago I went to Hawaii for the first time with my now fiancé. On our first day there, I caught traveler's diarrhea. So every item I ate, I pooped out shortly after. Not thinking it was a big deal, but already having an unpleasant experience, we went into the ocean. I felt a rumble in my tummy but ignored it, figuring it was just gas. A wave came and knocked us both over, rolling me around a little. I was still on the sand but slightly submerged, and as I was rolling around trying to upright myself I crapped my bathing suit. I waddled back up to the beach trying to hold remaining poop in. I told my significant other that I crapped my pants and we rushed back to the room, where we found the inside of my bathing suit covered in poop and sand."" —zhis616

2. The trashcan poop: ""My mom and I were in Kentucky for my older brother's soccer tournament. We were out during the day, and came back to the room running down the halls because both of us had to poop so bad. Being younger, I naturally got to the toilet first. But my mom couldn't hold it. So she came into the bathroom with me, grabbed the trashcan, and proceeded to shit in the trashcan while crying with laughter and telling me how much of a bad daughter I was. To this day, anytime she tries to judge me, I just remind her of the time she shit in a hotel bathroom trashcan."" —allycoop

3. The just-married poop: ""My husband and I were heading out for our honeymoon; we were talking and having a good time. I thought I had to fart, but instead, a whole intestine's worth of diarrhea came out. I was wearing these thin leggings and it seeped out onto our new car seats. I tried sitting sideways so that I wouldn't get them messed up, but the poop started running down my butt cheek. After driving for 10-15 minutes, with my husband laughing and me being all squishy, we pulled into a sketchy-looking car wash that had cameras up everywhere. I got baby wipes and went to the backseat, butt in the air, spreading my cheeks so that I could wipe, despite the cameras. My husband, you ask, was outside with my leggings. He had hung them up on the mat cleaners, spraying yellow poop all over the place...I love him."" —ashurhunter

4. The mountain-of-poop poop: ""We were in Nepal hiking the Himalayas and had to use squatty potties — the same ones the villagers used. One particular squatty was especially ripe, and by this point, our entire group's stomachs had all given up on life. Of course, no one heeded the warnings not to throw toilet paper in the hole, so we all did. By the time I was able to use it, the poop was literally flowing over the top, so we were pooping on top of poop in this horrific vicious cycle. By this point, we began to take all our toilet paper with us, filling this one, lone plastic shopping bag. Let's not even discuss the smell."" —kfl17

5. The you-thought-you-were-safe poop: ""On my first cruise I made it the entire time without getting sea sick. On the last night, I was feeling pretty good and wanted to loosen up for games and karaoke, so I had a few drinks. I assume that's what caused the events of the following morning. I woke up at 6 a.m. and bolted to the bathroom having to make a choice: What's going in the toilet? I had diarrhea AND I had to vomit. I opted to sit on the toilet as that seemed to be slightly more urgent. But midway into the first round, it was time to vomit. The sink was just within reach if I leaned, so I put the left corner of my mouth on the ledge and let it go. It's the sickest I've been in my life. I sat there for 35 minutes, continuously squirting poop and puking. Every convulsion of my stomach sent more out both ends simultaneously."" —Anonymous

6. The never-trust-a-fart poop: ""I went to Vegas with a buddy of mine with the intention of doing a shit-ton of hiking. It was halfway through the trip and we were about to head to our biggest hike, The Grand Canyon. As we were walking through one of the casinos, my stomach started to grumble and scream and do cartwheels. So, I'm thinking I need to just fart and, well, a fart ends up being much more — I shit my pants. So, I run to the bathroom while yelling at my friend, ""shit, shit, shit, shit,"" and I just throw my boxers in the trashcan. I free-ball it back to the hotel and get another pair of boxers. Then, while we're waiting on the bus, getting ready to head out, I once again decided to trust a fart, and tah-dahhh.... I ended up hiking the Grand Canyon free-ballin' again. Lesson learned: Never trust a fart."" —corypayton

7. The illegal poop: ""Three years ago, I went on a long-haul hiking trip to Nepal with my brother and dad. We were in India just before we travelled on to Kathmandu and it was my 20th birthday so, to celebrate, I enjoyed a delicious margarita at a bar in Delhi. Flash forward two days, and we are staying in Kathmandu to meet the rest of our hiking group and get ready to set out for the Annapurna Circuit. My stomach had been rumbling for about 24 hours, but nothing of note had happened, so I was feeling good and excited. The morning before we left, I was bathroom-locked with unbelievable stomach pains, but the toilet had nothing to show for it. Later that night, once we had checked into our hotel, all hell broke loose. I was up for hours vomiting and shitting my guts out. I had to throw away three pairs of underwear because the shit kept on flowing, even in my slumber. As we had already paid for this trip and weren't going to turn around to get me medical attention, I hit the trail in a makeshift toilet paper diaper — it was no match for the miles I was hiking and quickly disintegrated. The best part: relieving oneself in nature on the trail is STRICTLY illegal, so I spent the first full day on the trail literally pooping my shorts to avoid certain arrest for desecrating the sacred trail."" —maggievoelzke

8. The roadside poop: ""It was a hot summer day, and we were stuck in stand-still traffic on our way home from a trip. Our 6-week-old daughter needed a diaper change, so we pulled off to the side of the road. Her diaper was just wet, so I decided to try and change her real quick in my lap. BIG MISTAKE. As soon as I took off her diaper, she started pooping what looked like thick mustard EVERYWHERE. My husband was scrambling to pass me wipes, and while I waited, I had no choice but to catch the mustard poop with my bare hands! MY BARE HANDS PEOPLE. We both were cleaned up eventually, but that feeling of warm sticky poo between my fingers is one I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."" —juneburgs

9. The road trip emergency poop: ""My parents took a road trip with my grandparents, great aunt, and great uncle. They were on the highway in standstill traffic, no exit in sight, when my great aunt insisted that she had to go to the bathroom and couldn't hold it. She ended up standing up in the van while my grandma held a plastic bag up to her butt to have diarrhea in it. The whole time my parent's had their heads hanging out the window, and everyone in the van was gagging. When she finally finished they tossed the bag out of the window and tried to never speak of it again."" —heatherl4208780e9

10. The six-mile-hike poop: ""For spring break my freshman year of college, my family and I went on a trip to Paris to visit my sister, who was living in France at the time. Day three of the trip's itinerary started with visiting the Opera Garnier and the Sacre Coure. All the French cheese we had with every meal had been making me particularly gassy, so after we walked out of the opera, I thought the loud traffic and open air would be a good opportunity to let it out. Long story short, it wasn't only a fart. I didn't say anything, and figured the next event for the day wouldn't take long. Instead, my dad ended up dragging us on a six-mile walk, uphill, all the way to Sacre Cour. I walked six miles uphill to the highest point in Paris with shit in my pants."" —emmyj4d30548d4

11. The Versace poop: ""On a trip to Israel, my friend noticed this little lady in our group shivering. He wrapped his solid white Versace trench coat around her. Later when we returned to the hotel, she came up behind him and draped it back around his shoulders, saying 'thank you.' He couldn't see it but everyone behind him could see where she had shit all the way down the length of the coat. It looked like a mudslide."" —ceciliay

12. The pre-excursion poop: ""I was away for a month-long trip to Spain after high school. We all gathered in a park to go horseback riding and I suddenly had to GO. This was not going to wait until after the ride...it was hardly going to wait until I had my pants undone! I crawled deep into a patch of spindly trees and went. It wasn't a clean one, so I had to actually find random pieces of garbage to use as toilet paper."" —julieb18

13. The silver lining poop: ""I went on a school trip to Peru with about 20 other people. Everything was going fine the first couple of days, but after eating chicken one night, it all went downhill. It was like a chain reaction; once one person got diarrhea, another followed. Only two out of the 21 people on the trip did not get a case of explosive diarrhea — even the chaperones were sick. This trip required many hours on a bus with one small bathroom, which soon became a problem and people started getting bags out in case they could not make it to the bathroom. We made multiple emergency stops along the way, but no place had a bathroom big enough for 21 people. Students even started carrying around their own toilet paper because the rolls kept running out. Eventually a doctor visited our hotel and gave us all medication to stop these explosions. On the bright side, the medication made our pee glow in the dark and it was pretty cool."" —cait16

14. The midnight surprise poop: ""My girlfriend and I planned an epic Pacific Northwest vacation that culminated at the Women's World Cup Final in Vancouver. After the US won, we ventured into the city to celebrate and wound up at an authentic Japanese noodle house. The food was amazing! Afterward, we went back to the Airbnb. In the middle of the night, I woke up to the worst stench ever. In a sleepy stupor, I rolled over to ask my girl, 'Babe, did you shit the bed?' Turns out, yes, she had. Apparently she has an MSG food allergy. Worst part, we found out two hours later so do I."" —smalltownsmalltater

15. The just-couldn't-wait poop: ""In the early 2000s, I went to Hawaii to help get my grandmother prepared for her move back to the mainland. After her departure I stayed behind for a few days to enjoy a vacation and she encouraged me to eat/drink as much of the items left in her refrigerator so they wouldn't go to waste. So I popped a bottle of sparkling cider before heading out to dinner. I enjoyed the stroll to the restaurant, and had a good meal. But as I was getting ready to settle my tab I felt an urge in my bowels. I was totally afraid of pooping in public so I quickly paid my bill and left to begin the quick journey home. As I walked, the urge got stronger and stronger. Remember the scene in Up In Smoke when Cheech has to poo and keeps repeating to himself, 'Buttcheeks stay together...buttcheeks stay together?' That was me. Finally I was about 30 feet from my grandma's apartment, concentrating so hard on keeping it in, when my body just couldn't hold it anymore. I shat myself. The worst part? I was wearing a short skirt and thong underwear so the liquid poo ran down my leg and onto the concrete balcony/walkway in front of my grandmother's and her neighbor's apartment doors and windows."" —jennifern49169f1d8

16. The stand-and-deliver poop: ""Last summer I went to Milan with my family, and one night we decided to have dinner somewhere near our hotel. We found a Basque restaurant next to a Korean restaurant and the Basque restaurant seemed to be closed. We had never had Korean food before, so we went there, and had a VERY spicy veggie omelette-type dish with some kimchi. That same night, as we were about to go to sleep, I kinda started feeling sick. The moment I stood up, I started vomiting and pooping all over the hotel floor, and kept doing so for like five minutes. The staff changed our room and I couldn't eat for two days."" —beatrizdelai

17. The coffee-fueled poop: ""My family was on a road trip from Texas to California to visit some family we hadn't seen in awhile. We decided we would be crazy enough to do the 20-hour drive non-stop, so we all took turns driving while everybody else slept. I got the graveyard shift at 2 a.m., and I was getting really drowsy, so I stopped at a gas station to get some coffee. It worked, but I forgot that coffee is like the atomic bomb of laxatives to my intestines and will literally flush me out like an apocalyptic tsunami. It was 7 a.m. when I started feeling my stomach growl, so I pulled into a rest stop and ran into the restroom screaming 'OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD' at the top of my lungs — I didn't think I was going to make it. When I got to the toilet there was a giant spider web and black crust growing on the toilets so I squatted over it. I walked out of the stall relieved that I had made it to the restroom and expelled the entire contents of my stomach. As I was washing my hands, my mom pointed out the giant poop stain on my shorts, and that's when I walked back to the stall and realized that my 'effective squatting' had actually failed. I'd missed most of the toilet, which meant it was all over the toilet, the floor, and the toilet paper holder. My mom helped me clean the mess all over my shorts and all over that crusty rest stop. When my dad found out what happened, he pulled out the camera and took a picture of me right outside the rest stop to capture the moment."" —rosecguamex",buzzfeed
9,This is Serena Williams' last week at No. 1. Will she ever get back? | FOX Sports,"Serena Williams topped the WTA rankings released Monday, her third-straight week as No. 1 in absentia and 10th overall following her Australian Open victory, which was her last match before announcing her pregnancy. It'll also likely be Serena's final week atop the sport, 15 years after her debut at No. 1. When the new rankings hit next week, she'll drop to No. 2, flip-flopping again with Angelique Kerber, who first took the No. 1 spot from Serena back in September before the odd mathematics of the rankings formula saw them flip back-and-forth five times.

With her point totals continuing to drop for every tournament she misses, Serena will slide farther and farther down the rankings until she becomes unranked after the 2018 Australian Open (if she doesn't return before then). Right now, Serena is third on the all-time list of weeks at No. 1 with 319. That puts her only behind Steffi Graf (377, 58 weeks ahead) and Martina Navratilova (332, 13 weeks ahead). The tennis world fully expects Serena Williams to compete for Grand Slams upon her return. Any rational observer would probably put the over/under on post-pregnancy majors at 2.5 and that might even be too low. But what about No. 1? Will this be the last time we ever see Serena Williams' name officially atop the sport she's dominated for almost two decades?

I don't see why it has to be. Though I wouldn't necessarily bet on it, the possibility of a No. 1 return is far more realistic than the following scenario - ""36-year-old returns after pregnancy seeking a No. 1 ranking that nobody besides her has ever reached while over the age of 30"" - might suggest. Here why:",fox-sports
6,Sally Yates: Trump aide told Flynn blackmail risk,"(CNN) Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she alerted the White House earlier this year that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be ""essentially blackmailed by the Russians.""

""We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" Yates told a Senate judiciary subcommittee, in a high-profile hearing on Russian meddling into the US election.

Yates told the panel that she had a meeting with White House Counsel Donald McGahn on January 26 to tell him that she had information that statements by Vice President Mike Pence, based on his conversations with Flynn, were false. She was joined in the meeting by a senior career official in the Justice Department.

""We weren't the only ones that knew all of this, that the Russians also knew about what General Flynn had done and the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others,"" Yates said, relating the contents of her conversation with McGahn.

Yates was speaking at a hearing led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, who opened the hearing with an implicit rebuke of the President and his alternative explanations for the interference in the election.

The South Carolina Republican said the hacking was not the work of ""some 400-pound guy sitting on a bed or any other country,"" a reference to a comment Trump has previously made on the matter.

Trump fired Flynn, a retired general, for failing to disclose discussions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak about US sanctions against the Kremlin and for not telling the truth about them to Vice President Mike Pence. Yates did not say specifically that her concerns about Flynn's behavior was related to these calls, but she appeared to be implying that was the case.

In her opening statement, Yates said that she planned to be as ""fulsome and comprehensive as possible"" within ethical and legal boundaries.

Yates also warned in her opening testimony that there were some issues she could not address publicly because they involved classified information. Similarly, she said that as a former official she was not authorized to discuss Department of Justice or other executive branch deliberations. It was not immediately clear how those constraints would affect her testimony on the Flynn question. Neither Flynn nor Trump were directly referenced in her opening statement.

""The efforts by a foreign adversary to interfere and undermine our democratic processes — and those of our allies — pose a serious threat to all Americans,"" Yates said.

Graham asked Yates whether she had any information about whether there was collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia.

""My answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information,"" Yates said.

At one point in the hearing Graham asked both Clapper and Yates how information about Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador, that eventually led to his sacking, made it into the newspapers. Trump asked a similar question earlier on Twitter. Both former official said they did not know how that happened.

Trump went on the offensive on Twitter Monday morning, hours before the hearing began, blaming the Obama administration for Flynn's security clearance and asking the committee to question Yates over leaking classified information to the media.

""General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,"" Trump wrote , adding later , ""Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council.""

A White House official told CNN that the administration plans to rebut Yates by employing two strategies: Calling into question her objectivity by arguing she is a partisan Democrat and questioning the timeline of events she is expected to present.

The Senate judiciary committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee also heard from former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who spoke in advance of Yates. He testified that he did not know about the FBI investigation into Russian meddling in the election and whether there were any links to the Trump campaign until its existence was announced in a congressional hearing by FBI Director James Comey in March.

""During my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director -- both (former FBI) Director (Robert) Mueller and Director Comey -- on whether, when, and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations,"" Clapper said.

Clapper issued a clarion call for vigilance over Russian election interference before it further eroded US democracy.

""They must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations,"" he said. ""They are now emboldened to continue such activities in the future, both here and around the world, and to do so even more intensely.""

Graham, the leader of Monday's hearing, also invited former President Barack Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, to testify with Yates and Clapper, but she rejected the invitation through her lawyer, noting the last-minute timing of the invitation. A source familiar with Rice's discussions told CNN that when Graham invited her, Rice believed it was a bipartisan overture and was prepared to accept. However, ranking Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse indicated to her that the invitation was made without his agreement, as he believed her presence was not relevant to the topic of the hearing, according to the source.

Of the four former Trump campaign aides at the center of the Capitol Hill's Russia probes -- including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former foreign policy adviser Carter Page and former campaign adviser Roger Stone -- Flynn has generated the most heat following a steady stream of revelations.

Investigators on the House oversight committee raised the possibility last month that Flynn may have broken the law by not disclosing payments from RT-TV, widely considered by US officials to be a propaganda arm of the Russian government, on his 2016 national security clearance form. Flynn's lawyer at the time argued that Flynn had been open about his speech to RT-TV, including briefing the Defense Intelligence Agency on his trip.

Yates' appearance itself had been fraught with drama ever since House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes' delayed her House hearing at the last minute, as part of a chaotic three-week stretch that saw the House Russia investigation almost fall apart and Nunes become the subject of a House ethics probe.

The Washington Post reported at the time that the White House had blocked Yates by asserting executive privilege, which allows the President to stop a former aide from testifying. White House press secretary Sean Spicer vehemently denied the reports at the time and said that the White House actively supports Yates' testifying in public.

A White House official said last week that the administration still wants Yates to testify in public and reaffirmed Spicer's comments. Graham and Whitehouse also said they heard of no effort to stop her from coming before them.

Still, Democrats on the House Russia investigation are anxiously watching Monday's hearing: First, to see if Yates shows up and, second, to see how much she reveals publicly.

3,Germany searches all military barracks for Nazi material,"German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, center, speaks with Inspector General of the German armed forces Bundeswehr Volker Wieker, right, and Inspector Heer General Joerg Vollmeer, left, during a visit at military facilities on May 3, 2017 in France.

BERLIN — Germany ordered searches of all army barracks for Nazi memorabilia after finding startling pieces amid growing suspicion of extremism within the military.

Two discoveries over the weekend could lead to more Nazi material being found during the searches that will end May 16, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said.

""More will be revealed, that goes without question. I'm giving everyone fair warning that we will not back down,"" Von der Leyen said Sunday on the political talk show Anne Will. ""We're not through the worst just yet.""

Authorities on Saturday discovered a cabinet displaying helmets worn by the Nazi Wehrmacht, the armed forces that served Adolf Hitler, and other memorabilia in a barrack in the city of Donaueschingen, Spiegel Online reported. A similar discovery was made over the weekend at a military base in Illkirch, France.

Illkirch is the same base where a German officer was arrested in late April and accused of planning a racially motivated attack by disguising himself as a refugee.

In Germany, it is illegal to possess items that show the swastika. The pieces found at the barracks in Donaueschingen didn't carry the insignia, so no one could be prosecuted, Reuters reported.

This isn't the first indication that a deep-seated admiration of Germany's Nazi past may still exist.

In 2012, the same military base in Illkirch was at the center of a scandal when German soldiers drew a 13-foot swastika on a soccer field to celebrate their team's victory. More recently, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party — in the running this year to enter parliament — have made openly anti-Semitic comments.

Von der Leyen faced backlash last week for blaming recent events on ""weak leadership"" in the German military, following the arrest of the soldier for allegedly planning the attack against refugees. She later apologized. But the defense minister had strong words again after the latest discoveries at the bases.

""This is about the reputation of our armed forces,"" Van der Leyen told Bild on Sunday. Those trained to bear arms for the nation ""have to adhere to stricter standards.""

6,"Sally Yates told White House aides Flynn was a Russian blackmail risk. 18 days later, he was fired.","That's how long it took the White House to fire national security adviser Michael Flynn after acting Attorney General Sally Yates met with White House counsel Don McGahn to inform him that Flynn wasn't telling the truth about his interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and, as a result, represented a blackmail risk.

""We believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" Yates said in a Senate subcommittee hearing aimed at gathering details of the Russian hacking of the 2016 election on Monday in Washington. She added: ""Logic would tell you that you don't want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him.""

Yates noted that she met with McGahn on January 26 and again on January 27 to inform him of the fact that Flynn's assertions -- as relayed in the media by Vice President Mike Pence -- were simply not accurate. She did so both because she thought the Justice Department owed it to the vice president to tell him what they knew but also because they knew the Russians knew of Flynn's problems.

Yates added that McGahn asked for -- and was granted -- the chance to examine the materials that led the Justice Department to their conclusion. She said she did not know whether McGahn or anyone else in the White House actually reviewed those materials. Yates also repeatedly said she decided to inform McGahn and the White House of what they knew of Flynn so the White House could ""take action.""

Put aside everything else -- Republican attempts to steer the hearing to the unmasking of Trump campaign officials, incidental collection, leaks and leakers -- that transpired in Monday's hearing. The only thing that really matters going forward is what led McGahn and the rest of the White House to not act on the warnings -- and evidence -- provided to them regarding Flynn for more than two weeks. And, when they did finally fire Flynn, why was the reason cited by the White House the fact that he had not told Pence the truth regarding meetings with Kislyak? After all, the White House -- via McGahn -- knew that information from January 26 onward.

Here's Trump's explanation, from a February 16 press conference, about when he learned about Flynn's conversations with Kislyak (it's long but important to excerpt broadly from):

JUST WATCHED Trump: Press illegally gets information Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Press illegally gets information 02:34

""As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.

It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said 'well I don't see' -- to me, he was doing the job.

The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said 'doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.' But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.

That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.""

That just doesn't make sense. Trump says that the information provided to McGahn by Yates ""doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."" But, according to Yates' testimony -- under oath! -- what she told McGahn was that Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail risk.

So, either one of these two things is true:

Trump didn't see Yates' warning as passed to McGahn as cause for removal of Flynn. Trump didn't believe Yates was telling the truth about Flynn.

There's just no other options to explain why it took 18 days between Yates' telling McGahn that one of Trump's top national security advisers was compromised by Russia and that adviser being fired. And that, when Flynn was fired, the reason given was that he had not told the truth to the vice president as opposed to the fact that he was a prime target for Russian blackmail.

It's no longer an acceptable answer to say -- as Trump and White House advisers like Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus have -- that the information passed from Yates to McGahn was insignificant. Unless Yates is lying -- and no one has suggested she is -- then what she told McGahn on January 26 (and followed up on the next day) was of huge importance.

""Why wouldn't you fire a guy who did this?"" Sen. Al Franken wondered aloud at the hearing.

6,Judges appear divided on Trump's travel ban,"(CNN) Federal appeals court judges appeared divided Monday after hearing the Trump administration's defense of its travel ban, with one saying President Donald Trump never disavowed his campaign statements on keeping Muslims out of the country and another asking if the ban would still be illegitimate if Trump hadn't won the election.

""He's never repudiated what he said about the Muslim ban,"" Judge Robert B. King said, underscoring a key rationale for a Maryland federal district court's halt to the ban: That it is intended, as evidenced by Trump's campaign statements, to target Muslims and is therefore discriminatory.

But Judge Paul V. Niemeyer questioned the plaintiffs' attorney about his motive for opposing the ban.

""If some other candidate had won the election and issued this order, I gather you would have no problem with that,"" said Niemeyer, who was appointed by former President George H.W. Bush.

The nearly two-hour hearing before the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals came about two months after a federal judge in Maryland imposed a nationwide halt to the core portion of the President's revised executive order that sought to bar foreign nationals from six majority-Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang concluded, largely drawing on Trump's past statements, that the travel ban likely violates the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims, and the the Justice Department appealed that decision in March.

Jeffrey Wall, the acting solicitor general, argued Monday that Trump's statements about Muslims prior to taking office should not be considered evidence of discrimination. Wall emphasized that the revised travel ban was written after the President listened to judges' concerns that the original executive order discriminated against Muslims.

""(Trump) made it clear he was not talking about Muslims all over the world, that's why it's not a Muslim ban,"" Wall told judges.

But Omar Jadwat, a senior attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, argued the ban does not serve a valid national security purpose.

""There's a logical problem with the order,"" Jadwat said, noting the countries selected by Trump are ""not the list of countries you come up"" with when outlining those that pose the biggest threats to the United States.

He called the ban ""completely unprecedented,"" saying it has caused ""extraordinary injury"" to the plaintiffs, whose families cannot visit them in the United States.

JUST WATCHED Hawaii judge extends order blocking travel ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hawaii judge extends order blocking travel ban 02:19

The judges used the first half hour of the hearing to question Wall on how Trump's second order changed from the first, which critics have labeled a clear Muslim ban.

King, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, continued in that vein, pointing out that, as of Monday, the ""District Court here found the [ban] is on his campaign website.""

The controversial plan was removed from Trump's campaign website Monday, shortly after White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that he was unaware that the plan was still online.

The plan has been used against the administration's attempt to suspend travel to seven -- then six -- Muslim-majority countries and halt the admission of Syrian refugees into the United States.

Chuang, the district court judge, said in March that despite the Trump administration's assertion that the order was a travel ban, not a Muslim ban, ""the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban.""

On Monday, Wall emphasized that the President made his campaign vow to ban Muslims ""before he took the oath.""

""It is an archived press statement from 16 months ago,"" Wall said when asked. ""We took an oath and formed a government.""

The judges also asked Wall if the administration has been able to review the vetting procedures since Trump issued the first travel ban in late January.

""What we have been doing since January 27 is just litigating this order,"" Wall replied.

Jadwat, meanwhile, struggled to answer the judges' questions about what exactly he claimed is wrong with the text of the travel ban. The judges also asked the ACLU attorney whether his organization would challenge the same travel ban order if someone besides Trump signed it.

""What if [Trump] said he was sorry every day for a year?"" Judge Dennis Shedd asked.

""Sorry is not enough,"" Jadwat said.

Following the hearing, the ACLU held a press conference outside the courthouse featuring a handful of speakers who oppose the ban.

""The Muslim and refugee ban is a clear example of politics of hate and xenophobia,"" said Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. ""This is part of a larger agenda that this administration has against people of color, Muslims, trans community and many others.""

Normally, such an appeal of a district court's decision would be heard by a randomly assigned panel of three judges, and the losing party may ask for it to be reheard by the full court.

Yet in this case, the judges on the 4th Circuit decided it should be heard by the full court -- otherwise known as ""en banc"" -- in the first instance. Ten of the 15 active judges on the court are either Clinton or Obama appointees. A source familiar with the case told CNN that Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III -- a Reagan appointee and one of the most highly respected judges on the court -- recused himself from the case because Wall is his son-in-law as well as his former law clerk. Judge Allyson Duncan, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, also stepped aside. That means 10 of the 13 judges who heard Monday's case were appointed by Democrats.

What's at stake?

This is not the Trump administration's first legal showdown over the President's travel ban.

The original executive order was swiftly blocked nationwide by a federal judge in Seattle, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it, and then the administration spent over a month rewriting it, exempting several categories of foreign travelers and taking care to make no express mention of religion -- all in the hopes of avoiding legal scrutiny for a second time around.

Yet statements from Trump and his advisers, especially when combined with his continued inclusion of a 90-day ban on foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries in the revised executive order, have proved -- at least for now -- insurmountable in court.

The suit in front of the 4th Circuit on Monday was brought by several refugee rights organizations, along with individual plaintiffs who claim the executive order, if allowed to go into effect, would separate them from loved ones abroad. They also claim that the ""anti-Muslim animus"" underlying the second executive order is readily apparent from the litany of public statements Trump made before and after the presidential campaign.

Chuang disagreed with the administration's argument that Trump's campaign statements shouldn't count in lawsuits, noting that Trump's campaign website still contained a statement on "" preventing Muslim immigration "" at the time.

Chuang went on to explain that the consideration of such evidence by a federal court is a matter of ""common sense,"" as such ""explicit statements of a religious purpose are 'readily discoverable facts' that allow the court to identify the purpose of this government action without resort to 'judicial psychoanalysis.'""

""Simply because a decisionmaker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the 'reasonable memory' of a 'reasonable observer,'"" Chuang added.

As a result, the crux of the issue on appeal is likely whether the 4th Circuit agrees it is permissible to look outside of the four corners of the executive order to examine its purpose.

""We believe that it makes little sense as a matter of law and logic to ignore the President's own statements telling the country what the purpose of this (executive order) is,"" explained Lee Gelernt, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys and deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, in an interview with CNN. ""This is not a situation where we have to psychoanalyze the President. The President has made clear why he's doing this.""

The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the legal briefs in the pending case.

If the Trump administration wins in the 4th Circuit, will the ban immediately go back into effect?

Short answer: no.

A second federal judge in Hawaii, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson, issued a nationwide ruling that halted the 90-day travel ban on the same grounds as Chuang, finding it likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. Yet Watson's decision was slightly broader in scope and paused Trump's 120-day ban on refugee admissions as well.

So if the Justice Department prevails in the 4th Circuit, the case will then go back to the district court judge for further litigation and the key portions of the revised executive order will stay on hold as long as Watson's nationwide decision remains in effect.

The Trump administration's challenge to Watson's ruling will be heard by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle next Monday.",cnn
6,Trump's pick for Air Force secretary confirmed,"Story highlights The new Air Force secretary was confirmed with 76 votes in favor and 22 against

This is only the second Senate-confirmed position at the Pentagon since Trump took office

(CNN) Heather Wilson, President Donald Trump's pick for secretary of the Air Force, was confirmed by the Senate Monday with 76 votes in favor and 22 against.

Wilson is the first service secretary to be confirmed in the Trump administration and is only the second Senate-confirmed position at the Pentagon since he took office, with the other being Secretary of Defense James Mattis.

Wilson is a 1982 graduate of the US Air Force Academy, a Rhodes Scholar and a former member of Congress, representing New Mexico from 1998 to 2009.

During her confirmation hearings, Wilson said she plans to address the Air Force's pilot shortage as well as seek additional funding for the service's modernization efforts.

Her bipartisan confirmation is likely to be welcome news for the Trump White House, which has struggled to fill some of the Pentagon's top posts more than 100 days after inauguration.

10,Don't panic: iPhone 8 release is reportedly right on schedule,"Whispers of a jeopardized iPhone 8 launch due to production issues have circulated for a few weeks now, but a new report suggests the new iPhone is actually right on schedule.

Apple will unveil its next iPhones in September before going on sale in October, according to Economic Daily News sources (via DigiTimes). Apple's parts suppliers are reportedly on track to meet an August/September mass production schedule, with some key components already set to ramp up beginning next month.

Apple is widely expected to announce the iPhone 8 to mark the iconic smartphone's 10th anniversary this year along with the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, two phones that follow the tech giant's traditional update cycle.

The Economic Daily News report flies in the face of an analyst who, citing sources, said the iPhone 8's ""significant hardware upgrades"" have led to a two-month schedule slip, pushing the necessary production ramp up to October or November.

While Apple could have still unveiled the iPhone 8 in September, this rumored clog would have potentially led to limited supplies and lower-than-expected sales in the all-important holiday quarter.

Here are the best iPhone 7 deals this month

Wait. Did you say, October?

Though the iPhone 8 and its cohorts don't seem to be facing production delays, it's worth pointing out the new iPhones' sale dates are being circled for sometime in October.

This is later than Apple's typical iPhone releases, when the handsets hit store shelves in September.

Apple apparently anticipated releasing its iPhone trio in October all along, so while there's technically no delay, it will be later than shoppers are used to seeing. This could be due to the iPhone 8's rumored upgrades, though we're just speculating.

The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to be relatively minor upgrades over last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with the real ""wow"" saved for the iPhone 8.

The device is said to sport a curved design, edge-to-edge display, vertical dual-camera lens, wireless charging and augmented reality features, among other additions. iPhone shoppers are already holding out for Apple's 10th anniversary smartphone, so the real question now is: can the 8 meet all the hype?",techradar
10,"Invoke Cortana speaker: release date, news and rumors","We have truly entered the age of the digital assistant. When Apple first introduced Siri to our iPhones back in 2011 it seemed like a novelty without much purpose. Now digital assistants are establishing themselves as a solid part of everyday life, not only on our mobile devices but in our homes too.

Both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home have set themselves up as must-have accessories for early adopters of smart speaker home technology. With two years having passed since the first Echo getting released, there have been rumors about Microsoft joining the fray, and now we’re starting to see some solid info about the speaker from hi-fi speaker manufacturer Harman Kardon that’ll house Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana in your home.

Here you will find all the information we have about Harman Kardon’s Cortana-powered speaker, the Invoke.

Cut to the chase

What is it? A smart speaker powered by Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana, made by Harman Kardon

A smart speaker powered by Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana, made by Harman Kardon When is it out? Fall 2017

Fall 2017 What will it cost? Currently unclear, but we are expecting a premium price tag

Invoke release date

According to a now removed page on the official Harman Kardon website found by Slash Gear, the Invoke is: “Coming Fall 2017” although what this means for when you’ll actually be able to have one in your home is currently unclear.

Microsoft holds an annual event in October, which could be when we will see the official launch of the Invoke, although currently the speaker's development looks like its being spearheaded by Harman Kardon and just happens to have Cortana on board, so the launch could potentially happen independently of Microsoft.

We were originally hoping to see a Cortana powered speaker at tech conference CES 2017, and while we didn’t, we did see Cortana integration for both BMW and Nissan cars, so possibly Microsoft’s strategy is to put Cortana into other manufacturer’s devices rather than actually produce one of its own, for now at least.

According to MSPoweruser, there are rumors that Cortana’s speaker integration will be showcased at Microsoft’s Build 2017 developers conference, with the Invoke being a possible attendee.

I was told that Microsoft will show off and detail Cortana on speakers (and possibly the Harman Kardon Invoke) at Build 2017 next month.April 26, 2017

Invoke features

While information is fairly thin on the ground about the capabilities of the speaker, it is safe to assume that it will follow in the same vein as the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. It will certainly be able to play music, answer questions and control your smart home products.

In terms of playing music, we know from a recently discovered device setup app that the Invoke (and any Cortana-powered speaker) should have the ability to select which music app is the source for your music, meaning you can play music from Spotify, Pandora, and others.

This feature was revealed when Microsoft released a Device Setup app in April, leading us to think that a Cortana-powered speaker was imminent.

Smart home product integration is still slightly untested ground, so it will be interesting to see which products play nicely with this first generation device.

What looks like it will really set Invoke apart is its ability to make phone calls, a feature that is still missing from all the current competitors on the market. This will technically take the form of a Skype voice call, but using an app for calls looks like it may be the way voice calling is going, with recent rumors hinting that Apple will be replacing voice calls with Facetime Audio on iOS 11.

Invoke design

The Invoke looks more than a little like the Amazon Echo, although when creating a speaker with 360 degree sound it's probably inevitable that you’re going to create something fairly cylindrical. It's crafted out of metal, and looks like it’s going to come in either a chrome or black finish.

A smart move?

Harman Kardon has a reputation for high quality speakers so one of the things we can be certain of is that the Invoke will sound good. What’s uncertain is the price tag. We're assuming that with its premium looks and the likelihood of premium guts, it will almost certainly come at a premium price.

With an Apple smart speaker in the pipeline, and with Amazon opening up its development tool-kit so that anyone can make a speaker with their mic set-up, the market is likely to get very crowded in the next few years. Microsoft needs to find a unique selling point for its smart speaker and it will be interesting to see if the Invoke is positioned as the ‘premium’ option.",techradar
1,"At college commencement speeches in 2017,  it's a no-Trump zone on most campuses","Graduates turn their tassels during the conferring of degrees portion of the commencement ceremony at Radford University May 6, 2017. (Photo: Heather Rousseau, AP)

Caution: If you attend a campus commencement address this spring, you could be entering a no-Trump zone.

Most college and university graduation speakers contacted by USA TODAY said they would not address the elephant in the stadium. And mention of the president and party politics has been conspicuously absent from the speeches that already have been given.

“If they invited a politician to speak, they’d get what they expected. Since they didn’t, I’ll take that as a direction’’ and avoid the subject, said former NASA astronaut Kathryn Thornton, who may speak about space exploration at Sweet Briar College in Virginia.

“Anybody whose commencement speech could be put on the editorial page of a newspaper doesn't understand the job,’’ said Anthony Esolen, an English literature scholar who will speak at Hillsdale College in Michigan. His advice: “Leave the shifting sand dunes of the day far behind.’’

As for Trump, he asked, “Why on earth should I mention the president? …. I have instead to decide whether I will talk about Milton or Dante or Dr. Johnson…’’

That seems like a sound approach to Cristina Negrut, a connoisseur of commencement speeches who founded the website graduationwisdom.com. Love Trump or hate him, “we already have enough people trying to label him, like Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes,’’ she said. “Another label – ‘liar’ or something -- is not helpful.’’

The talk at graduation is of everything but Trump, including memories of a graduation past (writing coach Roy Peter Clark at Providence College); indigenous American languages (2016 MacArthur genius grant winner Daryl Baldwin at Miami University in Ohio); mountain climbing (mountaineer Conrad Anker at the University of Utah).

Speakers cited tried and true rules for commencement speeches to explain why they will not talk about the man everyone else is talking about.

It’s about the graduates, not the speaker’s politics

The most common piece of advice a first-time graduation speaker receives may be “it’s not about you.’’ It’s good counsel, said CNN political analyst Fareed Zakaria, who has delivered commencement addresses at Harvard, Sarah Lawrence and the University of Oklahoma, and this year speaks at Bucknell. “My views on Donald Trump are well known and easily discoverable. There’s no need for me to impress them on students and their families.’’

But it’s not all about the graduates

Even if the graduate would enjoy hearing the speaker trash the president, Grandpa or Grandma – who keeps Fox News on all day – might not. And it’s his day, too.

Accentuate the positive

“You want to strike a celebratory note,’’ Esolen said, and an optimistic one. These days, that pretty much rules out politics. “I’ll leave notions of ‘American carnage,’ for another venue,’’ Thornton said – a dry allusion to the signature phrase in Trump’s inaugural address

Eliminate the ephemeral

Esolen said politics is fine in a commencement speech – “if you are talking about Edmund Burke or Tocqueville or Aristotle.’’

The writer Anna Quindlen, who estimates she’s given three dozen commencement speeches over the years, plans to strike a similar note at Washington University in St. Louis: “I prefer to try something that will stand the test of time.’’

Jonathan LaPook, CBS News’ medical correspondent and an NYU professor of medicine, said he doesn’t plan to touch on the Affordable Care Act debate when he speaks at the Quinnipiac University Medical School: “This is their first graduating class, so I have to be a little evergreen.’’

Make ‘em laugh

“Funny speeches are best,’’ said Negrut, the speech maven. She points approvingly to Modern Family sitcom creator Steve Levitan’s You Tube video previewing his speech this month at his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It features MF’s Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) announcing Levitan as the speaker, but claiming never to have heard of him.

Zakaria said that if he mentions Trump at all, he will probably do so humorously, because “there is so much about him that lends itself to humor.‘’ But that also is tough, he said: “There is so much competition.’’

Clark, founder of the National Writers Workshop, recalls the uses of humor from his own graduation from Providence in the grim Vietnam War year of 1970, when spring classes ended early because of student anti-war protests.

The speaker was the political humorist Art Buchwald. He didn’t attack President Nixon by name, but let the graduates – some of whom who’d be drafted – know he understood their concerns about Nixon and the war. Clark never forgot how Buchwald ended: “Years from now, when people ask you what you did at your graduation, you can say you laughed.’’

Sincerity and levity

Some speakers will talk about Trump. Maz Jobrani, the Iranian-American stand-up comedian, is giving the speech at his alma mater, UCal-Berkeley. “I have to talk about him, because I’m an immigrant,’’ he said. “The best graduation talks are sincere, and I have a lot of sincere feelings about his impact. He needs to take responsibility for his words.’’

Some audiences want a political message. On a campus like Berkeley, which has become a battleground over political speech, an anti-Trump message presumably would resonate. A place like Liberty University in Virginia, where Trump himself will deliver the commencement, is another story.

“How to handle the national zeitgeist at this particular moment is a struggle,’’ Quidlen said. “I'm hoping to speak to the graduates about who we are as individuals and as a nation, and who we hope to be, in a way that is informed at some level by the tone in Washington.’’

During commencement season 2016, when Trump was the presumptive GOP nominee, he was the target of several high-profile attacks. At Stanford, documentarian Ken Burns accused Trump (without mentioning his name) of nurturing “an incipient proto-fascism’’ as well as “jingoistic saber rattling’’ and “dictatorial tendencies.’’

He acknowledged that it was an unusual setting for such a polemic, but said, “There comes a time when I -- and you -- can no longer remain neutral, silent.’’ He got a standing ovation.

At Johns Hopkins, director Spike Lee worried Trump would start World War III. At MIT, actor Matt Damon asked why, if our world is one of many simulations run by a superior civilization, “we're in the one where Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee? Can we, like, transfer to a different one?'’

This year, many campus speakers are politicians – Joe Biden at Cornell, Colby and Harvard, Hillary Clinton at Wellesley and Medgar Evers College in New York City, Bernie Sanders at Brooklyn College, Sen. Elizabeth Warren at UMass-Amherst and Wheelock College, Vice President Mike Pence at the Naval Academy and Notre Dame and Trump as the Coast Guard Academy.

It’s not clear if their speeches will be partisan. One early return: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking May 1 at Fisk University in Nashville, did not mention Trump, saying only that ""The election showed how much work needs to be done to rid our nation of negative attitudes…’’

Thornton, who teaches at the University of Virginia, said speakers should understand that the world will not long remember what they say: “I’ve been going to graduations for over 20 years and I can’t remember a word, or who gave it. I’m speaking on Saturday; by Sunday they’ll have forgotten everything. So I figure the pressure is off.’’

16,Richard Simmons sues tabloids over false sex-change story,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share After years of media speculation over the whereabouts of Richard Simmons, he reportedly is speaking up for himself—with a lawsuit. USA TODAY

Richard Simmons is fighting back against the tabloids.

In a libel lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, the fitness guru is calling out National Enquirer, Radar Online and American Media, Inc., for publishing ""cruel and malicious"" articles about him transitioning from male to female.

Stories appearing in those publications between June 2016 and March 2017 had headlines about Simmons' ""shocking sex surgery,"" which the workout personality has denied he's undergone. The Associated Press, People and The Hollywood Reporter have obtained a copy of the suit.

According to THR, the complaint reads, ""National Enquirer and Radar Online have miscalculated."" The suit calls the reports ""particularly egregious"" — not because transitioning isn't OK, but because that isn't an accurate representation of Simmons' identity.

""The National Enquirer and Radar Online have cheaply and crassly commercialized and sensationalized an issue that ought to be treated with respect and sensitivity. Principles of freedom of speech and press may protect their prerogative to mock and degrade the LGBTQ community ... (but) Mr. Simmons, like every person in this nation, has a legal right to insist that he not be portrayed as someone he is not. Even the most ardent supporter of sexual autonomy and LGBTQ rights is entitled to be portrayed in a manner that is truthful.""

People reports that Simmons is also calling out his former associate, Mauro Oliveira, for sharing the false and libelous sex-change information with National Enquirer and Radar Online, and having “blackmailed, extorted and stalked” him.

American Media, Inc., which owns both National Enquirer and Radar Online, directed USA TODAY to a statement online that references the lawsuit.

""For Mr. Simmons to claim that his privacy has been invaded is hypocritical when his entire livelihood is based upon the public consumption of his image,"" the statement reads. ""To wit, Mr. Simmons signed a lucrative merchandising deal with a major branding company in April to handle licensing of his name and likeness. At the same time, he protests that he is entitled to privacy and therefore should not be subjected to scrutiny of the media, which has raised reasonable questions about his health and whereabouts since he disappeared from the public eye almost four years ago. ... We stand by our reporting about Mr. Simmons, and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and win public vindication of our reports.""

AP reports that the lawsuit, which says Simmons often dressed in drag as part of ""his well-known and long-standing burlesque-style entertainment persona,"" seeks unspecified damages as well as an apology and retraction for the stories.

Simmons has reluctantly been in the limelight recently after a podcast about his low profile, Missing Richard Simmons, became one of the most popular podcasts in the country. Since then, Simmons was hospitalized for indigestion and released.

When contacted by USA TODAY, Simmons' longtime representative, Tom Estey, had no comment on the reported lawsuit.

9,Michael Vick hopes NFL rookie Joe Mixon is 'humbled',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Michael Vick spoke at Willie Colon's charity golf event benifitting research for lupus. Andy Vasquez/NorthJersey.com

BERNARDSVILLE — Michael Vick knows what it's like to make the kind of decision that haunts you for the rest of your life.

The former NFL quarterback also knows about trying to move past that mistake, and embracing a second chance.

And so when Vick looks at running back Joe Mixon, the Cincinnati Bengals' controversial draft pick this season, he hopes Mixon understands just how fortunate he is to be playing in the NFL.

""Joe got an opportunity,"" Vick said Monday at the Willie Colon Charity Golf Outing benefitting Lupus Research Alliance. ""He's an exceptional talent. Other than that, he [wouldn't] get that opportunity. I think he's learned from it and hopefully he's humbled by what's happened to him.""

The Cincinnati Bengals have received backlash for drafting Oklahoma's Joe Mixon. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)

Mixon, who starred in college at Oklahoma, has all the skills to be a successful NFL running back. He was projected to be a first round pick. But in July 2014, Mixon was arrested for punching Ameila Molitor in the face while in college.

Many teams viewed the incident as unacceptable and took Mixon off their draft board. Jets general manager Mike Maccagnan strongly hinted that the team wouldn't draft Mixon.

Mixon fell to the second round in last month's draft, where he was selected 48th overall by the Bengals.

Vick, of course, made his own terrible decision when he was one of the best and most popular players in football. He spent nearly two years in federal prison after being convicted for his role in a dogfighting ring.

That ugly incident remains a part of Vick's legacy -- it always will be. But after two years away of the league, Vick returned to play seven seasons and start 48 games with the Eagles, Jets and Steelers.

Vick has long said he hopes others can learn from his mistakes. And now, he hopes others can learn from Mixon's error, too -- including Mixon.

""He wouldn't have done it if he knew what he'd be dealing with now,"" Vick said of Mixon. ""And I think kids have just got to use that as an example.""

After his arrest, Mixon accepted a plea deal for misdemeanor assault and was suspended for the 2014 college football season. Security footage released to the public in December showed Molitor shove Mixon in the chest and slap him on the neck before Mixon knocked her to the ground with a right hand to the face. Molitor suffered several broken bones in her face as a result. Mixon and Molitor reached a settlement last month.

""Joe is young man, and he made a mistake,"" Vick said. ""Let's be honest. You rarely see guys having encounters like that, and it should never happen. I never condone it, I don't think it's right at all.""

9,"Ezekiel Elliott, Dak Prescott explain what they’ve been working on in the offseason | FOX Sports","Ezekiel Elliott had one of the best rookie campaigns by a running back in NFL history, falling 177 yards shy of Eric Dickerson’s rookie rushing record despite sitting out the final week of the season. Dak Prescott went from somewhat of an afterthought fourth-round pick to Cowboys’ franchise quarterback, leading the team to a dramatic turnaround in 2016.

But that doesn’t mean Elliott and Prescott haven’t been working on their games in the offseason. The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and star quarterback participated in the Cowboys’ home run derby Monday and discussed what they’ve been looking to improve upon in their sophomore season.

“Becoming a more dominant second-level runner,” Elliott said, via the Dallas Morning News. “I think there were a couple of times last year where I could’ve been [better] on certain runs when I got to the second level. So just kinda focused on finishing my runs and making guys miss at the second level.”

That must be a scary thought for opposing defenders. Elliott, who led the NFL in rushing yards and attempts last season, consistently got to the second level thanks in part to the Cowboys’ dominant offensive line.

If Elliott, who had three runs last year that went for more than 40 yards, adds some elusiveness to his game, he could threaten to become the eighth player in history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season.

As for Prescott, he wants to progress in all facets.

“I’m only one season in, so the whole game,” said Prescott, who threw for 3,667 yards with 23 touchdowns and four interceptions as a rookie. “There’s a lot of things. I can study film better, get better at my drop-backs, be more accurate at times. There’s a lot I can get better at.”

Judging by the footage from Monday’s home run derby, neither will focusing on becoming two-sport stars anytime soon.

9,Jessica Andrade explains exactly how she will knockout Joanna Jedrzejcyzk at UFC 211 | FOX Sports,"Through her first three fights at strawweight in the UFC, Jessica Andrade has been as dominant as anyone on the roster as she’s torn through her opponents en route to a championship this weekend in Dallas.

At UFC 211, Andrade will face Joanna Jedrzejczyk, who is currently the second longest reigning champion in the UFC behind Demetrious Johnson as she looks for her fifth consecutive title defense.

While Jedrzejczyk has experienced a few minor hiccups in her fights, she’s been fairly dominant during her reign as champion while taking out every contender the division has thrown at her including two wins over highly touted grappler Claudia Gadelha.

As much as Jedrzejczyk has been able to dispatch all of her past opponents, Andrade has still seen a few weaknesses in her game and one particularly glaring flaw that stood out to her during the champion’s last title defense against Karolina Kowalkiewicz last November.

“Watching the last fight, especially, we saw that Karolina [Kowalkiewicz] was a girl that didn’t back away from Joanna when she was getting pressured, which was something new. Pretty much everybody that fought her before, once Joanna put pressure they would walk back. We noticed that she didn’t do as well with other people that would back away from her,” Andrade described when speaking to FOX Sports.

“We are very much aware of everything Joanna does well and we are even more aware of what I do well and how those two match. If Claudia [Gadelha] was able to knock her down with a jab, once my straight [punch] lands or one of my hooks, I know there’s going to be a party in Brazil.”

Harry How/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

Andrade is well known for the way she stalks opponents across the Octagon before unleashing a hellish flurry of punches.

Like many of the old school greats from Brazil such as Wanderlei Silva or Mauricio “Shogun” Rua, Andrade is relentless with her offensive onslaught and she’s not sure Jedrzejczyk has ever faced anyone like her before or maybe never will again.

“The way that I put pressure on in fights is something Joanna has never had to deal with. She’s not used to someone just bullying her or just grabbing her and with pressure all the time,” Andrade said. “This is something we’re expecting her to have problems with because she is so technical, she is someone who comes from a really strong technical background. We know this from history that people who are too technical, they sometimes lose themselves with an opponent who are not as technical or not as predictable as them. This is something we are really hoping will make a difference. We know that it’s going to make a difference cause I’ll be honest, it’s really difficult to prepare against someone like me.

“The way that I fight, it’s not easy for my opponent to just sit there and think. Once I start getting my punches going, they aren’t going to have time to think.”

Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports

Of course, Andrade doesn’t discount what Jedrzejczyk offers in return because she wouldn’t be champion for as long as she’s been without a ton of skill to counter everything her opponents throw at her.

Before she was UFC champion, Jedrzejczyk was a multi-time title holder in Muay Thai kickboxing and she’s translated her striking art to mixed martial arts where she’s become one of the most fearsome stand up fighters in the world.

As strange as it might sound, Andrade concedes that Jedrzejczyk is probably the better technical kickboxer in this fight, but that doesn’t mean she won’t get hurt when getting punched in the mouth with a thudding left or right hand from the Brazilian contender.

“The thing with Joanna, she does have a lot of punching power but it comes a lot from speed and technique. We are very much aware of that. I’m not as technical as her, probably won’t ever be because that’s not the game that works for me,” Andrade said. “I know my strength. I know there’s probably no one at strawweight that is as strong as I am. There’s probably no other strawweight that has the power and strength that I have and that’s going to show in the fight.

“I don’t think she can even prepare for someone my size and my strength in her camp. It’s not something very easy to prepare for.”

Between her strategy to put the pressure on Jedrzejczyk from the opening bell to the power she possesses in both hands, Andrade feels like she has every weapon necessary to walk into UFC 211 as the challenger and walk out as the champion.

Andrade absolutely respects Jedrzejczyk but that’s not going to save her once they step into the Octagon together where she’s predicting a violent end to the fight.

“Since we got the fight, even before, I’ve seen the fight playing out in many ways. I think I could knock her out, I could finish her. She’s got that long skinny neck that I could grab onto and get a submission,” Andrade described. “Honestly, the way I see it, I’m going to get a knock out before the third round.

“At some point in those 15 minutes, my hand is going to connect and I’m not going to let her get back up. I’m not going to let her recover. I’m predicting a knockout by the third round.”",fox-sports

9,"Maria Sharapova loses grudge match to Genie Bouchard, who called for her lifetime ban | FOX Sports","Two weeks after calling Maria Sharapova a “cheater” who should be banned from tennis for life, Genie Bouchard doled out her own punishment to her former, fallen idol, defeating Sharapova 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 in a fortuitous and dramatic second-round meeting at the Madrid Open.

The expected fireworks were strictly limited to the play – anyone hoping for the off-court comments to spill over into any sort of mid-match antics would have been sorely disappointed, except for the fact that the match had more twists and turns than Sharapova’s suspension drama. Bouchard won the first set, was outclassed in the second and appeared to be heading for the inevitable defeat when she went down 1-2, 0-40 on her serve in the third set. She battled back to win the game and then, after three straight breaks starting at 3-3, the Canadian saved a break point at 5-4 and held serve to win the two-hour, 51-minute marathon in Spain.

(AP) AP/Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Bouchard, who grew up rooting for Sharapova, said in April that she’d lost respect for the Russian after her drug ban and declared her ability to return to tournaments via wild cards unfair to other players. The comments, which were the harshest of the many anti-Sharapova sentiments on tour, set up a match that had the anticipation of a Grand Slam final, despite being a Monday meeting at a second-tier tournament that was played immediately after a Mikhail Kukushkin match.

Officially it was a matchup between the No. 60 and No. 262 players in the world but the rankings belied the talent and stakes. Bouchard, a former Wimbledon finalist, has plummeted to No. 60 in the world and entered the tournament without a tour win since January’s Australian Open. Two years ago, she’d been ranked No. 6. Sharapova, of course, is a five-time Grand Slam champion who just finished a 15-month suspension for taking the drug meldonium, a medication that had only been added to the banned list weeks before.

Her comeback has been controversial due to those wild cards, an argument that ignored two simple facts: Sharapova is still one of the best players in the world and that tournaments exist to make money. If anyone else had been playing Genie Bouchard on a Monday night in Madrid, it’s safe to say the match would have barely registered with tennis Twitter, let alone earn worldwide attention. She deserves what people will give her.

(AP) AP/Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Rising to the occasion, Bouchard played her best match in months though both players struggled, the latter blowing multiple opportunities to blow open, or stay in, the third set. On one of the biggest points of the evening, the Russian had an easy, open backhand to even the match at 5-5 in the decider. She pushed it wide. Whether she was too amped up (the grunts started at a high decibel and only got louder from there), too nervous or had too little muscle memory – who knows. Bouchard won the next three points, sealing the match with a forehand, cross-court winner.

Sharapova will lament the missed opportunities and perhaps her strategy too; she went for winners early in rallies which, against Bouchard, is a little like a baseball player going up hacking against a pitcher who can’t throw strikes.

For those hoping for drama of the non-tennis variety, even the handshake, usually the moment where built-up friction tends to play out, was anticlimactic – which isn’t to say it was without some perceived tension. Sharapova walked to the net and appeared to say “well played,” while Bouchard shot her an icy glare, said nothing and held her stare for a split-second longer.

And the award for most awkward handshake of 2017 goes to… pic.twitter.com/8VPqrJeuGI — beIN SPORTS USA (@beINSPORTSUSA) May 8, 2017

In the end though, it was barely confrontational. (Bouchard, with her one career title, waited until she was in the safety of the interview room before throwing shade.) There was no need for it to be anything more. Maria Sharapova and Genie Bouchard had spent the previous three hours playing out their beef. The scoreboard said more than any handshake ever could.",fox-sports
9,Jay Cutler explains how Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky can be successful in Chicago | FOX Sports,"Doug Gottlieb: “I’ve heard you say that [the Bears] ‘shouldn’t play Trubisky. No matter how far downhill it goes, you should let him sit, you should let him learn, you got Mike Glennon, you’ll be fine.’ Can Chicago create the type of environment that allows him to be successful?”

Jay Cutler: “I think they can. I think they’ve got the people there that know what it takes to have a good quarterback. I mean you look across the league and to have good quarterback play, you’ve got to have good players around the quarterback. That’s just kind of how it goes. There’s no one out there winning games and throwing for huge numbers unless they have some [good players] around them.

""I think maybe the one rare exception to that rule is Aaron [Rodgers], because he makes so many plays outside the pocket and on the run. Other than that, guys have really good players around them.

""I think the Bears know that. You look at the roster now and I’m sure there’s going to be some guys that flash and are a little bit unexpected. And maybe the kid comes in and he’s unbelievable and he lights up training camp and he’s a lot more ready than anyone thinks. That’s definitely a possibility.

""But with Dowell [Loggains] there, the offensive coordinator, and John Fox, he’s been around the block a lot, and Ryan Pace coming from New Orleans, seeing how they mold around the quarterback - they’ve definitely got people there that know what they’re doing, it’s just finding the right guys.”",fox-sports

3,South Korea election: Polls open to choose new president,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Voters are choosing between 13 candidates

South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader.

Left-leaning Moon Jae-in is the clear front-runner with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger.

The election is being closely watched at a time of economic uncertainty and heightened tensions with North Korea.

Mr Moon wants to increase contact with the North in contrast to ex-leader Park Geun-hye who cut almost all ties.

On the final day of campaigning, Mr Moon called for an ""overwhelming victory"", saying it would help to heal a national divide caused by the downfall and impeachment of conservative Ms Park.

Mr Ahn, campaigning in swing states, said he was still confident he could win.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Opinion polls have put Moon Jae-in as the front-runner

In March, Park Geun-hye became the first South Korean president to be removed from power by impeachment.

She denies wrongdoing - though has repeatedly apologised - and is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power.

Mr Moon narrowly lost to Ms Park in the last presidential election in 2012.

He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Ahn Cheol-Soo is a former medical doctor turned software tycoon

He says he favours a two-track approach to encourage change, using increased dialogue alongside sanctions.

The BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says this could lead to tensions with Washington.

If US President Donald Trump pursues a hard line against the North - especially if it stages another nuclear test - Mr Moon's approach could cause greater tension between Seoul and Washington, he says.

As well as North Korea, domestic issues are high on the agenda for voters.

All the candidates are promising to protect the fragile recovery in South Korea's economy - the fourth largest in Asia - and to bring down youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high.

There are also promises to rein in perceptions of elitism in South Korean political society and reform the family-run conglomerates - chaebols - which dominate the domestic economy.

Observers are expecting a high turnout at the ballot boxes, with numbers boosted by younger voters.

6,Five things we learned from the Sally Yates hearing,"(CNN) Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have now filled in some key pieces of the sprawling puzzle presented by the Russia investigations.

Here are the top five things we learned from their appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Monday:

1. Yates delivered a forceful argument to the White House that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn could be blackmailed by the Russians

As soon as she read the details of Michael Flynn's interview with the FBI, at the end of January, Yates called White House counsel Don McGahn and said they needed to talk in private, she testified.

Yates brought one of her top staffers with her on the afternoon of January 26 to meet with McGahn and one of his top aides inside a secure facility on the White House grounds so they could discuss the FBI's interview of Flynn. It was then, she testified before senators Monday, that she warned McGahn that President Donald Trump's national security adviser could easily become a blackmail target for Russians, based on the answers Flynn gave to the FBI.

""That created a compromised situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Finally, we told them that we were giving them all of this information so that they could take action, the action that they deemed appropriate,"" she said. McGahn called Yates and asked her to return the next morning, January 27, when she testified that he asked her about four main concerns:

Why did it matter to the Justice Department if Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence?

What criminal statutes did Flynn potentially violate?

Would taking action against Flynn immediately interfere with the FBI's investigation?

Could he see the underlying evidence collected in Flynn's interview?

Yates explained that any official publicly repeating the lie that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, was increasing the chance Flynn would be blackmailed.

""Every time this lie was repeated and the misrepresentations were getting more and more specific, as they were coming out, every time that happened, it increased the compromise and to state the obvious: You don't want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians,"" Yates said.

Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined comment when reached by CNN Monday.

2. Trump is increasingly looking alone in his belief that Russia did not interfere to help him in the 2016 election

Trump has repeatedly called the investigations of possible coordination between his campaign aides and Russia ""fake news"" and, last week, said it may have been China that was behind the hacking.

That's an assessment that's looking increasingly detached from US intelligence officials.

""To me, the evidence was overwhelming, and very compelling, that the Russians did this,"" Clapper testified, when asked about Trump's most recent assertions.

Then, prompted by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, Clapper said Trump may still be helping the Russians by denying their involvement.

""You could rationalize that it helps the Russians by obfuscating who was actually responsible,"" Clapper said.

3. Clapper and Yates undercut one of the Trump White House's strongest arguments

Throughout the Russia probes, the Trump White House has pointed to testimony earlier this year from Clapper that he had seen no evidence in the January intelligence report of collusion between the President's campaign and Russia. That was before FBI Director James Comey publicly revealed that the FBI was, in fact, investigating that question.

Clapper said Comey's March 20 testimony was the first he heard of the FBI investigation. He later said that his original assessment was that there was no evidence he had seen worth including in the intelligence assessment -- but Yates later said that she could not answer the question because she did not want to reveal any classified information.

The implication from both officials' testimonies was that there may, indeed, be evidence of collusion -- this after months of the White House arguing that Clapper was clear there is no evidence.

4. The Senate investigations have strong strains of partisanship

Monday's hearing with Yates and Clapper was clearly focused on Russia's interference in the 2016 election, but Republican and Democratic senators still used it to land some partisan shots.

Republican senators grilled Yates on why she refused to enforce the first executive order that imposed a travel ban issued by Trump.

""I don't mean any disrespect: Who appointed you to the Supreme Court?"" Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told Yates in a comment that immediately lit up Twitter.

And Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz went to town on Yates, arguing that she may have broken the law by refusing to defend the order. She rebutted him by pointing to a later court ruling that supported her argument that she had a greater duty to protect against discrimination and uphold the Constitution.

Democrats, meanwhile, pushed hard with lines of attack clearly aimed at damaging Trump himself, not necessarily digging into what happened in the 2016 elections.

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, one of the Senate's most staunchly liberal members, took Yates on a winding line of questioning that ended with Trump possibly appearing on the witness stand in a hypothetical court trial against Flynn. At the end of the hypothetical exercise, Blumenthal pressed Yates if that was even remotely possible.

Yates responded: ""Potentially.""

The Senate Russia investigators may have maintained the air of being the adults in Congress investigating Russia's interference. But the Senate Judiciary Committee has proved over the last two hearings (including last week's with Comey) that partisanship is still a powerful force in its own inquiry.

5. The media matters

Yates was fired by Trump one day after it came out that she had refused to defend his travel ban and four days after she first alerted McGahn about Flynn. Meanwhile, it took 18 days for the White House to fire Flynn after Yates first told McGahn about his FBI interview.",cnn
6,Latest on Afghanistan options expected to hit Trump's desk this week,"(CNN) The final proposals for a planned troop increase in Afghanistan are expected to cross President Donald Trump's desk this week.

US officials say the likely range for the US troop increase in Afghanistan is between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, but could be as low as 1,500. The increase would be to accelerate training missions for Afghan forces and well as to fight the Taliban.

Trump has already given authority to set official troop levels in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria to Secretary of Defense James Mattis.

National security adviser H.R. McMaster and Mattis favor the troop increase being discussed at the Pentagon and increasing the US's financial investment in Afghanistan, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The same source said Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and his small contingent of nationalists are expected to push back when those recommendations hit Trump's desk.

Additional strategy options being presented to Trump include an outline for dealing with the Taliban, including scaling up strikes against the militant group, according to two US officials familiar with the proposal. The proposed strategy will, however, maintain the Obama administration's push toward reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

3,France: Paris Gare du Nord train station reopens after security alert,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Gare du Nord station is one of Paris' busiest transport hubs

The Gare du Nord train station in the French capital Paris has reopened after a security alert, officials say.

Platforms were evacuated and the area cordoned off by heavily armed police late on Monday evening.

No details have been given about the operation in one of Europe's busiest transport hubs. But local media report that police were looking for three suspects.

France is under a state of emergency since the Paris attacks of 2015.

Security had been stepped up across the country for the second round of the presidential election, which happened on Sunday.

Le Parisien newspaper (in French) said the operation focused on a train from Valenciennes, in northern France.

Police were looking for three men described as ""dangerous"" to French security forces by a foreign country, the newspaper said.

They had been spotted in Bordeaux and Marseille, as well as in Paris. Police had launched operations in each city, but had not managed to capture them, the report added.

Footage posted on social media showed many police vehicles guarding the perimeter of the station.

16,Racial discrimination suit against Fox expands with two more claimants,"Pedestrians walk by the Fox television studios, where a poster of Bill O'Reilly has been removed, April 20, 2017, in New York. Fox dismissed O'Reilly the previous day. (Photo: Richard Drew, AP)

As a racial discrimination suit against Fox News Network expands, the network continues to shuffle executive ranks to try and get beyond a damaging sexual harassment crisis.

Two additional plaintiffs are joining a suit initially filed six weeks ago in the Bronx Supreme Court in New York against multiple parties, including the network, parent company 21st Century Fox, Fox News and Fox Business Executive Vice President Dianne Brandi, and Judith Slater, a former senior vice president and company controller.

The suit, which now includes 13 former and current Fox employees, alleges that the network engaged in ""systemic discrimination based on race, ethnicity and national origin."" The newest additions, Elizabeth Fernandez and Claudine McLeod, both worked in the accounts payable department, which Fernandez departed in 2014 and where McLeod continues to work.

The suit expands as Fox News looks to rebound from an advertiser boycott that led to Fox's April 19 dismissal of its star host Bill O'Reilly after reports of harassment allegations made against him. Last week came the resignation of network co-head Bill Shine, who had been mentioned in several lawsuits filed against Fox News for allowing a workplace culture in which sexual harassment and racial discrimination could develop.

At the time of Shine's departure, 21st Century Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch promoted Suzanne Scott and Jay Wallace, who like Scott joined Fox News in 1996, as division heads -- Scott of programming, Wallace of news. Jack Abernethy remains network co-president. He was named as co-president with Shine in August 2016, a month after Roger Ailes stepped down as CEO in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

Last week, Amy Listerman became chief financial officer, a post she had held at Scripps Networks Interactive. And today, Murdoch announced that Marianne Gambelli would become Fox News’ president of advertising sales. Previously the chief investment officer at Horizon Media, Gambelli spent 22 years at NBC, most recently as NBCUniversal's president of sales and marketing.

O'Reilly's on-air replacement Tucker Carlson has managed to eliminate the crisis in the 8 p.m. ET hour. All of the commercial breaks have been restored for Tucker Carlson Tonight, Fox says, and all advertisers that left the hour have returned.

Two weeks ago, two-time Emmy Award winning and former co-host of Fox and Friends Kelly Wright joined the discrimination suit. Wright, who has been at Fox for 15 years, said in the suit, ""because he is Black ... has been effectively sidelined and asked to perform the role of a 'Jim Crow' – the racist caricature of a Black entertainer.""

Fernandez and McLeod allege they were ""subjected to numerous discriminatory comments and conduct by (the former controller) Slater."" Fernandez, who is Hispanic, said in the suit that when she was pregnant with her first son, Slater, during a meeting, asked ""if she knew the sex of the baby and if she planned on having more kids because 'Latinas like having a ton of kids'.""

McLeod, who is Panamanian and black, charges Slater with telling her “You people are high maintenance” in regards to health insurance costs and drive ""up everyone's ... premiums.""

Fox fired Slater on Feb. 28. “Fox News terminated Judy Slater before a single lawsuit or any amended complaint was filed,” the network said in a statement Monday.

Slater's attorney, Catherine Foti, said in a statement: “These are simply more baseless allegations.”

Former Miami Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti, a member of the undefeated 1972 team, has suffered falls, memory loss, and confusion, among other issues, according to a Sports Illustrated story to be published Tuesday.

Buoniconti played for 14 seasons, including seven with the Dolphins, and made eight Pro Bowls. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.

“I feel lost,” Buoniconti told Sports Illustrated. “I feel like a child.”

Following his playing career, Buoniconti hosted Inside the NFL with former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson from 1980-2001. After his son Marc was left paralyzed while making a tackle in a game for The Citadel, he started the The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis in 1985.

Sports Illustrated shared a preview of the full story in Peter King's Monday Morning Quarterback column on The MMQB. In the excerpt, Buoniconti, 76, said that “at 55 I was very normal. I’m not normal anymore.”

Even as recently as last November, Buoniconti served as emcee before a full house at a Legends Invitational dinner in California, according to Sports Illustrated. But he had trouble exiting the stage and called for his wife, Lynn, to assist him in the restroom.

Buoniconti also fell backward down some stairs and afterward told his wife, “I should just kill myself! It doesn’t matter!”

Buoniconti told the Miami Herald that he revealed the details of his current state ""... for all the guys who don't have a voice and are suffering like I'm suffering. It's not getting any better.""

“This has been my dad’s reality for a while now, and it’s been a frustrating and heartbreaking journey,"" Marc Buoniconti said in a statement. ""To see him like this after all he’s done to help others breaks my heart, and makes me want to do everything I can to find some answers for him and the countless other athletes dealing with these issues. We ask for your continued support as we try to help my father as he wages his courageous battle.”",usa-today

Crosby, who has a long history of head injuries, suffered a concussion during Game 3 last week but only missed one game before returning to the lineup.

From the outside looking in, a lot of people wondered if the Penguins’ captain was rushing back to the ice too soon. Regardless, he was cleared by doctors and he returned to action for Game 5.

But during Monday’s Game 6 in Pittsburgh, Crosby had another head injury scare on this brutal collision with the boards during the first period.

After being tripped by Braden Holtby’s stick on the goaltender’s follow-through, Crosby went headfirst into the endboard…and he went in hard. Crosby appeared to be dazed and got up slowly, but he wasn’t pulled from the game.

Both Crosby and the Penguins’ medical professionals feel good enough to allow him to continue playing in series despite its violent nature, and they would know better than anyone watching from home.

3,Federal appeals court grills Trump team over travel ban,"Demonstrators attend a small protest of President Trump's proposed travel ban on March 16, 2017 in New York City. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)

A federal appeals court in Virginia on Monday grilled the Trump administration over its attempts to institute a travel ban against six majority-Muslim countries, repeatedly asking why it should ignore President Trump's vows to institute a ""Muslim ban"" that would violate the First Amendment.

The judges of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond listed statements Trump and his officials made before and after he became president and signed two versions of the travel ban that clearly said, or hinted at, a religious basis for the executive orders.

""Is there anything other than willful blindness that would prevent us from getting behind those statements?"" asked Judge Henry Floyd.

Judge James Wynn pointed to Trump's comments when he signed the first executive order, when he said, ""We all know what that means.""

""Don't we get to consider what was actually said here, and said very explicitly?"" Wynn said. ""There was sort of a wink and a nod.""

Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall responded that the second travel ban was revised to remove any mention of religion and a president needs to be able to act to defend the national security of the country, no matter what he said during the campaign.

""The statements were ambiguous,"" Wall said. ""The president clarified over time that what he was talking about were countries and territories that have known links to groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Qaeda.""

The 13 appellate judges, who include 10 nominated by Democratic presidents, seemed likely to rule against Trump. They concluded the hearing without issuing a ruling, which could takes weeks to finalize.

But Monday's hearing exposed potential problems with arguments laid out by immigration advocacy groups that filed the lawsuit that could come back to haunt them if the case reaches the Supreme Court.

During the two-hour hearing, the three judges who were appointed by Republican presidents pressed Omar Jadwat, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, asking how long Trump would be hamstrung by his previous comments.

""How long does that taint last?"" asked Judge Albert Diaz.

Others asked how far back into Trump's history they can go to understand his intent when acting as president.

""Can we look at his college speeches? How about his speeches to businessmen about 20 years ago? Are we going to look at those, too?"" Judge Paul Niemeyer asked.

Judge Dennis Shedd asked what would happen if Trump apologized for his previous statements about Muslims and whether that would then allow him to institute his travel ban.

""What if he says I'm sorry every day for a year?"" Shedd asked, drawing laughter from the courtroom.

Jadwat said none of that mattered given the history of Trump's views in this case.

""It's possible that saying sorry isn't enough,"" he said. ""That's true in a lot of circumstances.""

Monday's hearing was part of the ongoing legal battle over Trump's attempts to temporarily suspend some portions of legal immigration to allow time to set up stronger vetting procedures.

The ban would block most immigration from six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — from entering the U.S. for 90 days, and suspend the entire refugee program for 120 days. Critics say Trump's executive order is nothing more than the Muslim ban he promised during his presidential campaign.

His first order, signed Jan. 27, quickly spurred chaos at airports around the world. It set off a rush of lawsuits that culminated with a federal judge in Washington state issuing a nationwide ban seven days later. His ruling was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The Trump administration decided not to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, opting to revoke the order and issue a new one.

A federal judge in Hawaii then blocked the revised travel ban just hours before it was set to go into effect March 16. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson ruled there was ""significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus"" toward Muslims in the revised order. The next day, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland issued another nationwide block on a section of the travel order.

The 4th Circuit judges are handling the ruling from Maryland, which was brought by several foreign-born people who are now U.S. citizens and green card holders. They fear their immediate relatives will be blocked from joining them under the travel ban. Next week, the 9th Circuit will hear oral arguments in the Hawaii case.

During Monday's hearing, judges also questioned the government about the status of its review of immigration vetting procedures. Why does the Trump administration continue insisting on 90- and 120-day travel suspensions, they asked, if it's already had so much time to improve vetting procedures? Judge Stephanie Thacker said the portion of Trump's order calling for a vetting review was in place for nearly two months.

""Was any vetting (review) done in those 50 days?"" she said.

Wall said government attorneys have interpreted court rulings as barring them from doing so.

""We've put our pens down,"" he said. ""We haven't done any work on it.""

If the nationwide blocks are upheld by either the 4th or 9th circuits, the case will likely end up before the Supreme Court, where Trump might have his best chance to implement the travel ban.

The high court, now at full strength with the addition of Trump's nominee, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, has divided in the past on immigration issues. Those 4-4 ties, which were commonplace following the death of Justice Atonin Scalia, could tilt in Trump's favor with Gorsuch on the bench.

Clapper said he was unaware of the FBI investigation into potential collusion

Washington (CNN) The White House responded to hours of Senate testimony Monday by saying there was still no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but also said he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until FBI Director James Comey announced it to the public at a House hearing in March.

Clapper previously made a similar comment in an interview on NBC . Pressed by Sen. Lindsey Graham if that claim was still accurate, Clapper said, ""It is.""

On the same matter, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates said her answer would require revealing classified information and noted that Clapper had just said he was unaware of the FBI's investigation.

9,How to fix the Utah Jazz in three easy steps | FOX Sports,"Re-sign your big free agents (hopefully)

Like the Los Angeles Clippers team they beat in the first round, the Jazz have several important free agents they'll try to re-sign this summer.

Unlike the Clippers, Utah has every reason to believe they'll bring their squad back intact next season. Gordon Hayward could decide to go join Brad Stevens in Boston, but the Jazz can offer a much more lucrative five-year deal, while the Celtics are limited to just a four-year offer.

Assuming Hayward comes back, Utah should be in play for George Hill. Re-signing the veteran point guard won't be easy. He has a history of injuries, as we saw this season, but reportedly is looking for a max-level contract.

That might give the Jazz pause, and it should. Committing max money to an injury-prone point guard on the downswing of his career is the kind of decision that can sink your franchise.

So if Hill insists on the max, the Jazz probably have to let him go. If the market is softer than he thinks, or if he's willing to take a discount to stay with a young, competitive team, then we can play ball.

Replacing Hill would be difficult, especially with Utah right up against the cap should Hayward return. But the Jazz can't panic. They're too promising to risk their future.",fox-sports

(AFP PHOTO / CHRIS J RATCLIFFE/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: CHRIS J RATCLIFFE, AFP/Getty Images)

With political risk receding after the French presidential election, Wall Street pros say the time is right for investors to rediscover Europe as an investment destination.

The decisive victory of centrist Emmanuel Macron over anti-immigration, nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen shifts the focus away from fears of political tumult to Europe’s improving business conditions and investment opportunities, market strategists say. Macron’s win is a vote for European unity, raises hopes for economic reform and, perhaps more important, ends talk of France breaking away from the free-market European Union.

“The Macron victory takes a very big risk off the table,” says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “I am more optimistic on Europe as a place to invest.”

The investment story in Europe, which has been held hostage by concerns about the political future of both France and the EU, has turned more upbeat post-election, even though Macron must still build a political coalition after parliamentary elections in June if he is to get things done. Still, investors are back to making investment decisions based on things like earnings and growth.

And they like the numbers they are seeing.

The European economy, which grew at a faster pace than the U.S. in 2016, is expected to grow nearly 2% this year, Deutsche Bank says. And that improvement, clearly visible in an indicator of eurozone manufacturing health in April hitting its best level in six years, is leading to a revival in corporate profits. Companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 stock index are expected to increase earnings 14% in the first quarter of 2017, the fastest growth since late 2015, earnings tracker Thomson Reuters says. Full-year profit growth is estimated at close to 20%.

Putting money to work in European stocks makes more sense given that they are trading at less-expensive valuations than U.S. stocks, says Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief multi-asset strategist at money-management firm BlackRock. Currently, European stocks are selling at 15 times earnings expected in the next four quarters, a 17% discount to large American stocks.

U.S. investors looking to profit from Europe’s recovery, can gain exposure to stocks headquartered in the eurozone in three ways:

• Invest in Europe-focused funds. U.S. investors can invest in broad baskets of European stocks via low-cost exchange traded funds. Examples include Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (VGK), SPDR Euro Stoxx 50 (FEZ) which invests in 50 of the eurozone’s largest companies, and iShares Europe ETF (IEV). Investors that want to bet solely on France’s stock market or Germany’s equity market can invest in country-specific funds.



• Buy European shares that trade in U.S. Active investors that want to make bets on specific-European companies can invest in ADR (American depositary receipt) shares, or foreign stocks that trade on U.S. stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Well-known ADR’s include telecom and wireless play Nokia (NDK), French drugmaker Sanofi S.A. (SNY), Italian eyewear maker Luxottica (LUX), Dutch food giant Unilever (UN) and Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS). Clemons cautions that investing in ADRs involves currency risk as the underlying assets you are investing in are in priced in euros. So, all things being equal, if the dollar strengthens vs. the euro, the value of your investment will fall; but if the euro gains vs. the dollar, your investment will rise in value.



• Buy U.S. stocks with strong sales in Europe. The broad S&P 500 index gets nearly 8% of total sales from Europe, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. But a handful of U.S. companies get a much larger share of their sales from Europe. Online travel site Priceline (PCLN) gets more than 70% of its sales from Europe and tobacco company Philip Morris does nearly 57% of sales there, according to data provided by Fundstrat Global Advisors. iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) gets more than 23% of sales from Europe while U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson gets nearly 22% of their sales there.

Investment dollars are expected to move back into Europe after Macron’s victory. Last year, European equity markets suffered $40 billion in outflows as investors tried to avoid political risk, Mateos y Lago says.

European stocks have a lot of potential to climb, as they have not enjoyed as big a rally as U.S. shares since the 2009 market low. The S&P 500, an index of large-company U.S. stocks, has rallied almost 255% since March 2009, vs. a gain of just 150% for the Stoxx Euro 600. Europe is also a little behind the U.S. when it comes to its economic recovery, which means “less positive news has priced into European markets, which gives them more room to run,” adds Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.

6,"The five fights Republicans will have on health care
The five fights Republican senators will have on health care","(CNN) Despite President Donald Trump's celebration in the White House Rose Garden last week, Republicans still have a long way to go before they can finally make good on their promise to dismantle Obamacare.

Passing a health care bill out of the House was the first step, but now the challenge of guiding a bill through the Senate -- where Republicans have an even slimmer majority -- begins. Republican senators have already said they will craft their own legislation and will use a process known as budget reconciliation to move it out of the upper chamber with 51 votes instead of 60, but that approach gives Majority Leader Mitch McConnell little room for error. Republicans can only afford two defections in their ranks.

Here are the five flash points you can expect as the Senate Republicans debate their way forward on health care:

Medicaid

Medicaid has long been in conservatives' crosshairs, but the benefit for states has been undeniable. Medicaid expansion has been a lifeline for constituents who suffer from mental illness or addiction and have been able to access treatment through the expansion.

Of the 52 Republicans in the Senate, 20 hail from states that expanded Medicaid in recent years.

Ohio's Rob Portman, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito and Colorado's Cory Gardner sent a letter to McConnell in March, when the House's bill was first released, expressing their concerns with the way the House bill handled Medicaid expansion.

The House's plan would end enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion in 2020. After that year, individuals on the program weren't kicked off, but once they cycled off the program, they weren't allowed to re-enroll. Essentially, the House's bill phased out Medicaid expansion over time.

The bill would also curtail federal support for the overall Medicaid program, giving states either a set amount of money per enrollee or a fixed block grant -- shifting the financial burden to the states.

JUST WATCHED Mulvaney: Health bill gives states control Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mulvaney: Health bill gives states control 00:49

Expect in the Senate that many of the lawmakers whose constituents have benefited from the Medicaid expansion will fight to keep the program intact longer. They will want to give individuals more time to transition off Medicaid and provide additional safety nets to ensure that people who may become ineligible for the program have another means to buy insurance. Meanwhile, expect Republicans who came from states that didn't expand Medicaid to argue that the program be phased out as soon as possible to save money.

Tax credits

One of the earliest controversies in the House's health care bill was the issue of tax credits. Conservatives argued the House's refundable tax credits were little more than a new entitlement program, a new name for the Obamacare subsidies Republicans had railed against for years. The similarities between the two -- Obamacare subsidies are also refundable tax credits -- prompted some lawmakers to dub the House plan ""Obamacare Lite.""

But more moderate Republicans argued that refundable tax credits in the House bill were inadequate -- largely because the tax credits were based on age, not income.

As CNN reported at the time when the Congressional Budget Office released its initial score of the House's bill, a 64-year-old making $26,500 would pay $1,700 for coverage in 2026 with Obamacare subsidies. But under House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan, that same person would pay $14,600 in premiums with the GOP tax credits.

In an attempt to lower the burden for low-income and older Americans, expect some GOP senators to push for some sort of means testing, which would take into consideration someone's income when calculating the size of their tax credit. In March, South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune, a member of leadership and a member of the health care working group, introduced a proposal along those lines targeted to boost the size of tax credits for lower income people.

Planned Parenthood

The House health care bill would defund Planned Parenthood for one year, a provision that could face increased scrutiny in the Senate where some moderate lawmakers like Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have already said they'd prefer to keep funding the women's health care provider.

""I, for one, do not believe that Planned Parenthood has any place in our deliberations on the Affordable Care Act,"" Murkowski told state lawmakers in Alaska in a speech earlier this year. ""Taxpayer dollars should never be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides.""

Taking the provision out could alienate the Senate's conservatives who viewed the House's funding repeal as a major victory and are now feeling pressure from outside religious groups to keep the defund in the Senate's version of the bill.

Pre-existing conditions

One key Obamacare-era regulation that would be changed dramatically under the House's health care bill protects people with pre-existing conditions.

The promise of protecting people with pre-existing conditions was at the epicenter of Trump's own campaign stump speeches. But under the House's health care bill, states would be able to opt out of the community rating protection, which would allow insurers to base premiums based on a person's medical history. This would only apply to those who are not continuously insured.

Experts have argued that it could have major ramifications for people with pre-existing conditions.

Expect moderate Republicans to take a serious look at how to make sure that people with pre-existing conditions have additional safeguards as they craft their own bill. The messaging for Republicans has already been brutal as Democrats have very publicly argued that Republicans are gutting an overwhelmingly popular protection from the Affordable Care Act.

Essential Health Benefits

Under Obamacare, insurers are required to cover 10 key benefits for consumers. Those range from hospitalization to maternity care, but the House health care bill changes that. In an attempt to drive down premiums, the House's conservative Freedom Caucus insisted that states be able to opt out of the essential health benefits requirements.

Conservatives in the Senate are expected to push for even more robust insurance deregulation in an attempt to lower premiums. One idea being considered would give states an ""opt in"" rather than an ""opt out"" on key Obamacare-era regulations like requiring insurers cover the 10 essential health benefits.

But that could stir concerns from moderate senators who already fear that the GOP has gone too far to scale down insurance protections for consumers back home. Waiving the essential health benefits could hurt people with pre-existing conditions because insurers could opt not to cover their treatment. Also, it could make it harder for those dealing with substance abuse or mental health issues to get help.",cnn
16,"Jimmy Kimmel returns to talk health care, his son and reaction to his speech","One week after Jimmy Kimmel's impassioned words about his newborn son's health crisis and the country's health care system, the late night host returned Monday night with more to say.

""One week ago tonight, I made an emotional speech that was seen by millions, and as a result of my powerful words on that night, Republicans in Congress had second thoughts about repeal and replace, they realized that what is right is right, and I saved health insurance in the United States of America!"" Kimmel said at the start of his show. ""Oh, I didn't? I didn't save it? They voted against it anyway? I really need to pay more attention to the news.""

Last week on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" the host tearfully revealed that his son William Kimmel was born on April 21 with a serious heart issue. On Monday, Kimmel said his son was doing well.

""I want to tell you because so many people have asked, our son Billy is doing very well,"" Kimmel said. ""He's eating, He is getting bigger. He's sleeping well. He can read now, which they say is unusual.""

Last week's monologue prompted an outpouring of support but also some negative reactions on social networks and in the media. Kimmel fired back at outlets like the Washington Times, which ran the headline: ""Shut up Jimmy Kimmel, you elitist creep.""

""I can't even count the number of times I've been called an out of touch Hollywood elitist creep this week,"" Kimmel said. ""Which, I have to say, I kind of appreciate because when I was a kid, we had to drink powdered milk because we couldn't afford the liquid ... My dream was to become an out of touch Hollywood elitist, and I guess it came true.""

Kimmel then sarcastically apologized for suggesting that children in America should have health care: ""It was offensive, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.""

Following the updates on his son and reactions to his speech, Kimmel again touched on the politics of health care.

""So now the health care bill moves from the House to the Senate, where hopefully some kind of common sense will prevail,"" he said.

Kimmel also had Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy appear on Monday's show. Cassidy told CNN last week that he can only support a health care bill that passes the ""Jimmy Kimmel Test.""

""Would the child born with a congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in that first year of life ... even if they go over a certain amount?"" Cassidy, who is also a physician, said last week.

Kimmel discussed the health care issue with Cassidy and jokingly thanked him.

6,GOP congressman: Republicans were 'irresponsible' to celebrate AHCA passage at White House,"Story highlights Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher said Monday that his fellow Republicans were ""irresponsible"" for celebrating the House's passage of the American Health Care Act at the White House.

""What are we celebrating? We haven't passed a bill into law,"" he said.

(CNN) Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher said Monday that his fellow Republicans were ""irresponsible"" for celebrating the House's passage of the American Health Care Act at the White House.

""The Democrats were singing on the House floor, singing on the House floor after the vote,"" the GOP congressman said on ""The Jerry Bader Show ,"" a local Wisconsin radio program. ""They were celebrating the vote going forward because they feel like it allowed them to get an electoral advantage and, honestly, the Republicans who went to celebrate at the White House -- I disagree with that approach.""

He went on to ask, ""What are we celebrating? We haven't passed a bill into law. The Senate's gonna re-write this thing. I've never seen the Packers pop the champagne at halftime. I just think that's irresponsible. And so I just would urge both sides to just lay down the traditional kind of political weapons if we can because this is a really complex topic and we need serious people working together to fix it.""

Gallagher, who voted for the bill, was referring his House colleagues' trip to the White House Rose Garden last week to tout their bill to replace Obamacare and to Democrats singing, ""Na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye"" to taunt Republicans on the House floor.

In the interview, Gallagher also criticized President Donald Trump for saying to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that Australia, which has a universal health care system, has ""better health care than we do.""

6,GOP defends having no women in health care group,"Washington (CNN) Just hours after House Republicans managed to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Senate is signaling it will write its own proposal -- announcing a group of 13 Republican members who will be responsible for crafting the Senate's plan.

All are male.

Senators in the group include Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, Health and Education Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander and conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee.

A GOP aide defended the makeup of the group.

""We have no interest in playing the games of identity politics, that's not what this is about; it's about getting a job done,"" the aide said. ""We'll work with any member of any background who wants to pass a health reform bill that will reduce premiums and take away the burdens that Obamacare inflicted.

""To reduce this to gender, race or geography misses the more important point of the diverse segments of the conference the group represents on policy -- from members who support Medicaid expansion, to those opposed to it, to those who have called for long term full repeal,"" the aide added.

The announcement of the health care working group is yet another signal that the bill passed out of the House is merely a starting point for Senate Republicans, who have been saying for months that they had serious concerns about the House's efforts to repeal Obamacare ranging from how the House bill dealt with Medicaid to how it handled people with pre-existing conditions.

Even as the legislation was passing on the House floor, Senate Republicans were admonishing the House's efforts.

""A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution,"" tweeted South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham

Here are the group of 13 Republicans who will work to build the Senate's bill:

6,Trump sent 4 tweets on the Sally Yates hearing. Not one of them was entirely accurate.,"(CNN) Between 6:41 p.m. and 6:50 p.m. ET Monday night, President Donald Trump sent four tweets focused on the Senate subcommittee hearing on Russia's meddling into the 2016 election that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

The four-tweet barrage shows just how closely Trump is monitoring the ongoing congressional investigation into ties between members of his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian intelligence officials. The quartet of tweets is also a window into how Trump hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest . He creates his own reality for himself and his followers.

Let's break the tweets down one by one -- in the order that they were sent.

""Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is 'no evidence' of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.""

Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

This is not entirely accurate. What Clapper said was not that he could definitively rule out collusion between elements of the Trump campaign and the Russians but rather that he was unaware of evidence suggesting there was any. In fact, Clapper noted that he had been unaware of the FBI investigation into the Russia ties with the Trump campaign -- driving home the point that he wasn't privy to every piece of information.

Trump is, broadly speaking, right that there is ""no evidence"" that has been released publicly of collusion between anyone on his campaign and the Russians. But that's not what Clapper said on Monday.

Tweet #2, 6:43 p.m.

""Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!""

Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

This one is way off the mark. It is ""old news"" that Yates met with White House Counsel Don McGahn on January 26 to discuss Flynn's problem. But what's new is that she told McGahn on that day -- and in a follow-up meeting the next day -- that not only was Flynn lying to members of the presidential transition about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak but also that she had reason to believe he had been compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target. Yates also offered McGahn the chance to go through the evidence the Justice Department had that led them to that conclusion. (It's not clear if he actually did so.)

Tweet #3, 6:46 p.m.

""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?""

The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

Trump is, again, conflating two things. The ongoing investigations -- in Congress and by the FBI -- are aimed at understanding the extent to which (and how) Russia meddled in the US election. Whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia is certainly a possible strand in that investigation but it is not the entire investigation or even necessarily the center of it.

As for the idea of these investigations as a ""taxpayer-funded charade,"" consider this: A foreign power attempted to influence the outcome of a presidential election in the United States and, according to many in the national security world, will try to do so again (and again). Looking into how they did it -- and trying to prevent it from happening again -- doesn't feel like a ""charade"" to me.

Trump tweet #4, 6:50 p.m.

""Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews!""

Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

Reasonable people can disagree about what the ""biggest"" story was coming out of the Yates/Clapper hearing. But, the idea that the surveillance story -- that the US government monitors foreign actors and could have swept up a conversation that person had with a Trump campaign official -- is a bigger deal than Russia having compromising information about the national security adviser doesn't pass the smell test for me.

I think it's absolutely worth trying to get to the bottom of how Yates came to know what she knew about Flynn and Russia and how that information got to The Washington Post. But, again, is that more important than finding out the depth of Russia's meddling in our presidential election and the extent of their contacts with Flynn and others within Trump's orbit? I think not.",cnn
6,Canadian journalist asked to leave 'Kushner family event' in China,"(CNN) After seeing advertisements for what was described as a ""Kushner event featuring Jared's sister,"" a Canadian reporter decided to attend. Then she was asked to leave.

At the event, Emily Rauhala , a Beijing-based correspondent for the Washington Post, was seated apart from her colleague, who faced similar resistance from the hosts.

""Some of her footage and audio was deleted by the event organizers on the Chinese side,"" she told Anderson Cooper on Monday evening.

""They actually deleted her recordings?"" Cooper asked his guest, who joined the program via Skype.

""That's right,"" Rauhala said, noting that while such a practice is ""inexcusable,"" it's ""also rather common in China when people get nervous about the press.""

During the event, Nicole Kushner Meyer, the sister of White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, mentioned her brother's new role in the administration while making a pitch to invest in her family's property. The New Jersey building makes use of an EB-5 visa program to draw in international investors, including the Chinese.

Kushner Companies later apologized for the name drop, and said it was not intended to be an 'attempt to lure investors' to one of its projects in New Jersey.

Though Kushner Meyer didn't directly connect the event to either her brother or the Trump administration while Rauhala was in the room, the Washington Post journalist told Cooper the message was clear.

""This was presented as a Kushner family event,"" she said. ""I later heard from another reporter -- who tweeted a picture -- that there was indeed a picture of President Trump ... on a slide that said 'key decision makers.'""

The event was meant to draw investors for 1 Journal Square, a $976.4 million residential and commercial project underway in New Jersey. The company says about 15% of it will be funded through the EB-5 program.

3,South Korea presidency 'won by liberal Moon Jae-in',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Korea under Mr Moon is likely to overhaul its policy towards the North

South Korean voters have overwhelmingly chosen the liberal candidate Moon Jae-in as their next president, an exit poll suggests.

It put Mr Moon on 41.4%, with his nearest challenger, conservative Hong Joon-Pyo, on 23.3%.

Mr Moon favours greater dialogue with North Korea, in a change to current South Korean policy.

The early election was called after a corruption scandal led to the impeachment of the former president.

Park Geun-hye is accused of allowing a close friend to extort money from companies. She denies all wrongdoing.

If Mr Moon's victory is confirmed, he is likely to be sworn in on Wednesday.

The exit poll was conducted jointly by three network TV stations.

Change is coming: analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Seoul

A Moon Jae-in presidency would represent a real shift in attitude towards North Korea. His policy is to increase contact with North Korea, in contrast to the tighter sanctions of the last ten years. He is unhappy about the deployment of a US anti-missile system on South Korean soil.

When Mr Moon was last in government, in the early 2000s, South Korea had a ""Sunshine Policy"" which meant co-operation with North Korea, a policy which was abandoned as North Korea tested nuclear weapons.

As policy in South Korea looks like shifting, many sceptics remain who think that no amount of talking to Kim Jong-un will persuade him to renounce either his despotic power or his nuclear ambitions.

For the last eight years, Seoul and Washington have been in lock-step over North Korea, with ever tighter sanctions and isolation. That is not Mr Moon's way. Is it Donald Trump's?

Who is Moon?

The son of refugees from North Korea, Mr Moon was jailed while a student in the 1970s for leading protests against military ruler Park Chung-hee - Ms Park's father.

Later, he served in South Korea's special forces before becoming a human rights lawyer.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Moon, pictured with his wife, has been there at key points in South Korea's history

Mr Moon, of the centre-left Democratic Party, unsuccessfully ran against Ms Park in 2012 elections.

He has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandals of Ms Park's era.

""I feel that not only my party and myself but also the people have been more desperate for a change of government,"" he said while casting his vote.

What are his policies?

Mr Moon has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions, in contrast to Ms Park who cut almost all ties.

He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Despite bad weather South Koreans gathered in Seoul to watch the results come in

But while tensions on the Korean peninsula ensured the election was closely watched, for South Koreans the priority has been corruption and the economy, with youth unemployment stubbornly high.

Mr Moon has talked of reforming South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, which dominate the domestic economy.",bbc-news
10,"iPhone 8 release date, news and rumors","Update: We've been hearing more good news about the iPhone 8 release date and fresh speculation that Apple will include AirPods in the box. Here's the latest iPhone 8 rumors.

Apple's iPhone 8 release date is expected to be less than five months from now, and we're already 3D Touch deep into new rumors about its 2017 smartphone.

It's the tenth anniversary of the iPhone and the design is due for big changes. We haven't seen a brand new look in three years, so prepare to be wowed.

The most immediate change may be to the name: iPhone 8, iPhone X or iPhone Edition, instead of just iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. This is a major refresh for Apple and its name deserves a giant leap.

Every iPhone 8 rumor really gives us a sense that Apple is overhauling its phone with at least one premium design – what we're calling the iPhone 8 – while also providing a basic specs bump for an iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.

We're sorting through all of the rumors to deliver the facts and cut through the far-fetched speculation, from the always-changing release date theories to the all-important iPhone 8 price.

Slide down to unlock.

Read our in-depth reviews: iPhone 7 | iPhone 7 Plus

What is it? The 10th anniversary version of Apple's iPhone

The 10th anniversary version of Apple's iPhone When is it out? September 2017 or maybe a bit later this year

September 2017 or maybe a bit later this year What will it cost? More than the normal $649 (£599, AU$1,079)

iPhone 8 release date

Hottest leaks:

September 2017 launch for iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus

Slightly later October 2017 date the curved, all-screen iPhone 8

The iPhone 8 release date is the routine new iPhone rumor we expect to stay the same every year, but Apple may do something different here, too.

Apple has launched a new iPhone in September every year since the iPhone 5 in 2012. September iPhone launches have a pretty consistent track record.

iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus may still launch in September sporting a worthy, but ultimately predictable design and feature upgrade.

iPhone 8 may deviate from this plan by launching a little bit later (still before Christmas) with the biggest changes for Apple's smartphone in several years.

Why? iPhone 8 production is said to be running one to two months behind schedule – new tech takes time. This could mean delays or stock shortages.

We still expect Apple to have an iPhone launch event around September 8 and it could ship the 7S phones one week after CEO Tim Cook first holds them up in the air.

But it sounds like you'll have to wait – one or two extra months – for that snazzy iPhone 8's curved AMOLED display due to supply constraints, according to Bloomberg.

Can you wait until October or November? We're skeptical of all of the moving release dates, but we do keep hearing the disheartening rumor over and over, as there's evidence that Apple could be having issues with both the OLED display itself, and embedding a fingerprint scanner into it.

TechRadar's take: We keep hearing the disheartening rumor that Apple won't have the redesigned iPhone 8 ready at the same time as the still unconfirmed iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. You still expect a September launch event with all three phones present, but you may not be able to buy the the iPhone 8 (the phone you really want) until October.

iPhone 8 screen

Hottest leaks:

A curved AMOLED display

A 5.8-inch edge-to-edge screen

No home button and no bezel

The iPhone 8 screen may radically change in size and shape, and it's about time for something bigger and more stylish than the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus era display.

The big rumor is that the iPhone 8 is going to sport a curved AMOLED display instead of a the usual flat LCD panel, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

We've all seen curved AMOLED displays in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the even bigger Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. iPhone 8's curve may be less dramatic, but still cooler looking than a completely flat phone.

There are other exciting benefits to an AMOLED display replacing the normal IPS LCD. It can deliver better contrast, more vibrant colors and include a battery-saving always-on display. It's also a better suited for VR and AR.

This has also more recently been rumored by sources, claiming that a curved AMOLED display is one of more than ten prototypes that Apple is considering - and that the phone could even have a higher-than-QHD resolution.

Who's going to help Apple push all of those extra pixels? Samsung is said to be supplying the OLED screens, beating out Sharp, which was once rumored for the job. Samsung may be able to deliver more curved screen in time, and Apple is said to have just put a curved screen order in with its long-time rival.

Just so it's clear: you might not see the fancy, new OLED display on every iPhone 2017 model due to supply issues. Thus, Apple may include it on just one iPhone 8 version.

Depending on how it all shakes out with Samsung, Apple is likely to reserve the AMOLED display for just the iPhone 8 Plus, or a separate higher-end 8 Plus Edition, luring you into buying the more phone instead of the smaller iPhone 8.

How big will the iPhone 8 screen size be? Rumors for this are all over the place, but everything says it'll be larger – around 5.8 inches, just like the Galaxy S8.

Don't worry. We expect a 4.7-inch iPhone 7S and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus, but the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 is the hot new size with the curved AMOLED display.

It won't be too big. Apple can easily make the display size larger without actually making the phone dimensions any bigger. It's just a process of elimination.

There's been talk of axing the psychical home button and building the Touch ID fingerprint sensor into the screen itself, a rumor dates back almost two years.

Doing this would eliminate the otherwise useless bezel around the screen. ""The entire face will be the display,"" claims Apple blogger John Gruber.

""And the Touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display. The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display. The speaker, everything. All the sensors will somehow be behind the display.""

Credit: @VenyaGeskin1

We've seen how that might look in the leaked schematic above, apparently based on a prototype of the phone. Other leaked dummy models suggest that design is pretty close to being accurate.

An 'all-screen' display is the hot new trend launched by Chinese phone maker Xiaomi and its Mi Max, and came to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus.

An unearthed Apple patent also shows this idea in action, eliminating the phone's bezels in the process. Another patent has since emerged, showing a similar concept, so it's certainly something Apple's at least thinking about.

If Apple ditches the home button, it could replace it with a 'function area,' with virtual keys, similar to the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar, according to one report.

It's not far-fetched. Apple tweaked the home button with the iPhone 7, making it no longer physically click when pressed, so this could be the next step.

Apple's one hurdle is: can it reliably put the iPhone 8 fingerprint sensor behind glass? Samsung reportedly tried and failed to do this in time for the Galaxy S8. The alternative is to give the iPhone 8 a rear fingerprint sensor, a rumor that keeps popping up that nobody particularly cares for.

Apple currently uses Japan Display for many of its screens, and while Japan Display is planning to start building OLED panels they're not expected to arrive before 2018.

Probably not this year, but these patents suggest it'll come eventually

It's possible that just a higher-end model will have these new screen features, according to the latest supply chain sources.

This third, premium model is currently dubbed ""Ferrari"", and this model alone may have an embedded fingerprint scanner and an edge-to-edge OLED display.

Looking even further ahead we might see a flexible or even foldable iPhone, as Patently Apple has found a patent for just such a device, and more recently another similar patent has turned up, but this is likely a long way out yet – as in iPhone 10 or iPhone X territory.

TechRadar's take: The premium iPhone 8 is heavily favored to get a stunning, new 5.8-inch OLED display – if it can't source curved screens and glass. If it can build Touch ID right into the screen, that's ambitious and something Samsung couldn't pull off in time for the recent Galaxy S8 launch. Nobody wants a rear fingerprint sensor on the iPhone. Just don't expect these huge feats for the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.

iPhone 8 design

Hottest leaks:

A curved glass back instead of aluminum

Smaller models may not change as much

Just when Apple has nearly perfected the aluminum unibody phone with the iPhone 7, it's now expected to be moving onto an all-glass design.

Yes, the tenth anniversary iPhone 8 is heavily rumored to debut a a curved glass back (echoing the front curved display), according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

The glass iPhone 8 rumor has since been given more weight, with the CEO of the company behind the iPhone's metal casing claiming one model of the phone ""will adopt glass casing next year.""

It would still require a metal frame apparently, which makes it sound a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, especially if both panels are curved. That lines up with a claim from a source that's proved reliable in the past that Apple is experimenting with a ""glass sandwich design."" Delicious, right?

And yet another source also points to a glass back, with a stainless steel frame in place of the aluminum Apple currently uses in its phones.

That exact design can be seen in the images of a dummy device below, mocked up based on the supposed design of the handset.

Here's where the iPhone 8 rumors conflict: Right now, we're unsure if the design is being readied exclusively for the higher-end 5.8-inch iPhone 8 Plus, or if the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are also due for the glass upgrade, like Ming-Chi Kuo suggests.

It could be that the smaller iPhones designs will remain relatively unchanged other a new color.

The last major iPhone 8 design rumor is that the new phone could get a little more waterproof. It may jump from an IP67 to IP68 rating, notes The Investor.

TechRadar's take: Expect a big change to the design of the phone. It's too early to say if every new iPhone size will sport the curved glass look and extra waterproof features, but we think the days of an aluminum iPhone are numbered.

iPhone 8 camera and AR features

Hottest leaks:

A vertically-oriented dual-camera lens

Augmented reality features

3D cameras

The iPhone 8 camera ""can do extraordinary things,"" we fully expect Tim Cook to say on stage come September. ""We never thought it possible before today.""

Cook's ambitiously sounding words are almost inevitable. In his quarterly investor calls, he has become captivated with the idea of augmented reality (AR), or what Microsoft calls ""mixed reality,"" (so you should fully expect Apple to call it augmented reality instead).

What can Apple do with AR? You may be able to point your iPhone 8 at an object and have it recognized, claims one source “familiar with the matter.” The camera app may be able to recognize and manipulate faces in the future, too.

Let's give you a more concrete example (and source). Veteran Apple analyst Gene Munster thinks you'll be able to find your seats in a crowded stadium or the groceries you need among all of the aisles by looking at your phone.

AR is supposed to map out where you want to go, and combined with Apple Pay, it could be a big winner for the iPhone 8 on forward, according to Munster.

""Your phone slowly going away and being replaced by AR,"" he said in an interview with Cheddar. ""This is beyond Pokemon.""

AR may be the reason why we've seen allegedly leaked iPhone 8 schematics with a vertically aligned dual-lens camera on back. That may be AR's big change, and right now we're not quite sure why that is.

There's also talk from Korea that Apple is working with LG on a ""3D photographing"" module for the iPhone 8, which could be used to add three-dimensional effects and work with the rumored augmented reality features.

What about your everyday photography? That could be upgraded, too, with the second lens on the dual-lens iPhone 8 gaining optical image stabilization.

But don't expect a bump beyond the 12MP sweet spot that Apple and other phone manufacturers have found, and don't look for the dual-lens snapper to the standard iPhone 7S, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo . It's likely to once again be limited to this premium iPhone 8 Edition.

We don't expect much change from the front-facing camera resolution, as Apple just upped to 7MP iSight camera for the iPhone 7. But as selfie photos become increasingly important, it could include extra camera focusing tricks to make each and every pixel count.

TechRadar's take: Apple is giddy with excitement about the prospects of AR, and that may be the hot new camera feature going forward. We already got a big dual-lens camera upgrade last year. It may get better this year, but not be as dramatic of a change. Instead expect Apple to tout the benefits of augmented reality.

iPhone 8 battery

Hottest leaks:

Wireless charging – finally

Fast charging

Two batteries

Anyone with a smartphone knows one battery just isn't enough, which could be why Apple is rumored to be sticking two in the iPhone 8 for extended life.

Though that sounds a bit unlikely. What's more likely is that Apple might take on a stacked mainboard internal design for the iPhone 8, according to one analyst.

It may fill all of the saved space with additional battery capacity and also finally support wireless charging without that aluminum design blocking the transfer of energy (that's why glass and plastic phones can do wireless charging and metal phones do not).

Foxconn is reportedly looking into the tech for Apple and, after all, without the headphone jack, Apple is one step closer to being free of cables completely. This is surely the next step, even if there are some doubters about these plans.

Apple might go beyond rivals and offer a truly wireless charger that works at up to 15ft, with no contact required between the device and the power source.

There's evidence that Apple has been looking into this tech, with Energous, the company behind it, supposedly working with a ""tier 1"" smartphone maker. It added that it's ""working with one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world"" and it will be shipping a product by the end of 2017.

Energous has also received a $10 million investment from Dialog Semiconductor, according to BGR, and Dialog just so happens to be a company that works primarily with Apple.

We've also heard from an analyst note, obtained by 9to5Mac, that all models of the iPhone 8 will have wireless charging - but it sounds like this will be standard rather than long-distance charging. Apple may also not include a wireless charger in the box.

Credit: Benjamin Geskin

A leaked schematic also shows a circle on the back of the iPhone 8, which is likely a wireless charging pad.

And when you plug the iPhone 8 in, you might not do so via a Lightning connector, with a report suggesting that Apple could swap that for a USB-C connection - though what's more likely is that Apple will simply use USB-C Power Delivery technology within a Lightning connector for faster charging.

TechRadar's take: Wireless charging and improved battery life are likely – but don't count on being able to charge from a distance, at least not on the iPhone 8. Apple may save this truly revolutionary for the iPhone 9 or iPhone 10, aka the iPhone X.

iPhone 8 internal specs and iOS 11

Hottest leaks:

3GB of RAM

A tiny 10nm A11 Fusion chipset

iPhone 8 is almost certainly going to transition us from iOS 10 to iOS 11, and undergo three months of beta testing following WWDC 2017 on June 5.

The internal iPhone 8 specs are also undoubtedly going to take another step forward with the Apple A11 chipset that's more powerful than the current A10.

What do iOS 11 and the A11 System on a Chip mean for iPhone 8? We may see finally Control Center customizations and Today menu widgets become refined.

iPhone 8 running iOS 11 is also likely to debut always-on screen settings (what will be displayed?) and an improved Mail app (hyperlinking text, finally?).

The new chipset, either called Apple A11 or Apple A11 Fusion, may stick with a quad-core processor since the iPhone 7 just launched with that.

Yes, octa-core processors is all the rage, but Apple has shied away from touting big numbers and instead focused on boosting performance. It's done just fine.

The same goes for RAM. It may stick with 2GB for the iPhone 8 and 3GB for the dual-camera iPhone 8 Plus. Of Apple's products, only the iPad Pro 12.9 has 4GB. Though an analyst rumor suggests all iPhone 8 models will have 3GB.

Perhaps the most convincing RAM claims come from another analyst, who argues that due to rising RAM costs the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus will have 3GB of RAM, while the iPhone 7S will have 2GB.

But the iPhone 8 may go for one smaller number: 10 nanometer. The move from the 16nm A10 Fusion to a 10nm A11 Fusion would make significant gains.

Qualcomm's 10nm Snapdragon 835 chip, for example, requires less energy and exhibits a performance boost on 16nm chips. Apple will want to rival this chip.

While Apple doesn't use Qualcomm's processor, it has used the San Diego firm's modem. But, as of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it has dual sourced the modem: some from Intel (GSM-only models [AT&T, T-Mobile and almost every other carrier]) and others from Qualcomm (GSM+CDMA [Verizon and Sprint]).

There's an ongoing lawsuit between Apple and Qualcomm for overcharging of standard issue patents, so there's a chance iPhone 8 could ditch Qualcomm altogether.

Couple this with the fact that Intel just announced a CDMA-capable modem that makes it compatible with Verizon and Sprint in the US, and Qualcomm may have just exiled itself from the new iPhone for 2017.

Graphic chip partner Imagination Technologies is in the same boat soon. Apple informed the British GPU supplier – an Apple partner since the iPhone 1 – that it'll drop the firm's graphics chip from the iPhone and iPad in the next two years. So, it'll still be in the iPhone 8 and iPhone 9, but maybe not the iPhone X.

TechRadar's take: The iPhone 8 is naturally going to be faster, but its speed boost may be wrapped in another quad-core processor and coupled with 3GB or 2GB of RAM. A lot of the specs depend on whether or not Apple is ready to show us the power of VR and AR. iOS 11 is almost a given, and we fully expect Apple to continue to harness the power of developers for tools like Siri and menu customizations.

iPhone 8 other features

Hottest leaks:

An iris scanner

A Smart Connector

New sensing technology

Free AirPods?

It might not just be the screen you'll be interacting with on the iPhone 8, as Apple is also rumored to be working on a ""new sensing technology,"" which would allow the phone to respond when you touch any side of it. Theoretically that could be used for example to change the screen brightness by swiping along the edge, or take a picture by tapping it.

One other rumored feature of the iPhone 8 is an iris scanner, which wouldn't be much of a surprise given that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 had one and Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus has the same.

Facial recognition of some kind is looking ever more likely, as it's been rumored again, and Apple's even acquired a company which works in that area.

One analyst has suggested Apple will bundle some free AirPods in with the premium iPhone 8 - that would be nice, but we'd recommend you don't hold your breath on that one.

The iPhone 8 might tighten up security in other ways too, as an Apple patent details a system that could get a thief's fingerprints and photo, as well as recording audio, video and their location.

We might also see a Smart Connector on the iPhone 8. This was rumored for inclusion on the iPhone 7 Pro – a phone which never launched, but with numerous pictures of a phone sporting the Connector it seems likely that Apple really was considering it, so the feature might be ready by next year.

We've already seen a Smart Connector on the iPad Pro, where it's primarily used to attach accessories, like keyboards.

Finally, there's some wishful thinking going on out there, with reports that say Apple is going to include free AirPods with the iPhone 8 – right in the box.

AirPods instead of wired EarPods using a Lightning or USB-C cable would be a huge perk for the premium iPhone 8 and help everyone get over the need to use an adapter.

TechRadar's take: The iPhone 8 might have an iris scanner, but only if Apple can make it fast to use. A Smart Connector is also a possibility, but seems a less useful fit than on an iPad Pro. Free AirPods seem like a longshot, but one we're hoping for after liking them so much as a standalone product.

iPhone 8 price

The iPhone 8 price may throw us for a curve ball come September since Apple is planning an all-new smartphone design. Here are the price rumors.

The smaller iPhone 7S could cost just as much as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, running $649 in the US, £599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia. That price really hasn't changed in the US, and it just recently went up in the UK (last year) and Australia (two years ago).

The iPhone 7S Plus price is also not expected to change based on the fact that the iPhone 7 Plus just saw a price hike (even in the US) to $769, £719 and AU$1,269. We don't need another price increase there.

Instead, Apple may launch an iPhone 8 Edition with a fancy curved display and an OLED panel (instead of LCD). That could send the bill of sale (for the parts) up 67%, and that expense may get passed onto you, the consumer.

The iPhone 8 price really depends on three things. Which version of the phone do you want? Is Apple releasing a third, more expensive edition with a fancy OLED display? And which storage capacities remain in 2017?

We've heard that the OLED model might come in just 64GB and 256GB varieties, but that 32GB isn't being killed off – the less desirable versions may get 32GB, 128GB and 256GB configurations.",techradar
10,Here's what the OS that could replace* Android and Chrome OS looks like,"Fuchsia, the mysterious new operating system from Google, has taken another step forward, lifting the veil on its user interface.

Screenshots have surfaced showing Fuchsia's UI so far, giving users and programmers alike their first real glance at Google's new OS, as reported by Ars Technica.

Unlike Chrome OS and Android, which are built on Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a Google-made microkernel called Magenta. According to Google programmers, Magenta's focus is on ""modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors.""

Though it's currently just speculation, it's possible that Fuchsia could be the beginning of a new software standard for Google-made products. The search giant is rumored to be trimming the edges on its operating systems, as seen by it bridging some apps between Android and Chrome OS last year.

As for Fuchsia, the new OS uses a current default system UI called Armadillo to build its layout and manage widgets. You can see how it compares visually to its Google-made kin in the images below:

Image 1 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 2 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 3 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica)

From first glance, Fuchsia maintains similar notes to Chrome OS and Android, such as clear-cut widgets and a colorful palette for windows on apps and notifications. Also noticeable are entire sections of the interface dedicated to Google's search functions and suggested content.

However, you can get a better idea what sets Fuchsia apart when it's in motion, a such as in the video below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw of Hotfix.net:

To be clear, Google hasn't stated any plans to actively replace Android or Chrome OS at this time, nor has it given a timeframe for when we might see its experimental new OS make its way to consumer products (if at all.)

That said, as we near ever closer to the Google IO 2017 conference next week, we might be lucky enough to learn more about what the tech giant has planned for its latest creation. In the meantime, the open-source files are available via GitHub for any crafty coders looking to dive into Fuchsia for themselves.

10,Amazon Echo Show launched: everything you need to know,"Amazon has finally announced the Amazon Echo Show, the first Echo device equipped with a screen.

The Show follows in the footsteps of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, which combined Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with a camera that can take pictures and make style recommendations.

The Show is a radical departure from previous Echo devices as it can provide you with information visually (via its screen) as well as through sound. Previous speakers were limited to using voice to communicate.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The newest entry in Amazon's voice activated line of Echo products

The newest entry in Amazon's voice activated line of Echo products How much will it cost? $230 (£220 / AU price tba)

$230 (£220 / AU price tba) When is it out? June 28

Amazon Echo Show release date

Confirming what was rumored earlier today due to a leak, Amazon has announced that the Amazon Echo Show will be released on June 28 in both the US and UK, with pre-orders open now.

That means you'll have to wait a month and a half to get your hands on the new speaker if you order it today, although it's nice to see it come simultaneously to both the US and UK, after the original Amazon Echo took over a year to arrive in the latter territory.

Amazon Echo Show features

As well as the Alexa voice assistant that we've grown familiar to thanks to its inclusion in existing Amazon Echo speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon Echo Show is equipped with both a screen and a webcam, which will allow it to both show, as well as tell, you information.

The screen is 7-inches in size, and is touchscreen enabled. It's capable of showing notifications, playing internet video, showing lyrics on Amazon Music, and it can also allow conversations between different devices in the same house.

It will be interesting to see whether this functionality is increased in the future to allow it to make voice calls outside of the home, as a pre-announcement leak from the WSJ suggested.

The screen can also be configured to show a live video feed from elsewhere in the house through compatible security cameras.

In addition to the screen, the Show is also equipped with a camera like the recently announced Amazon Echo Look. This is a device that Amazon is pitching as being a style-accessory, and which will analyse your clothes in order to make intelligent outfit suggestions.

This functionality will presumably also be making its way to the new Amazon Echo Show.

The Show is available in both Black and White colors.

As well as this new screen and camera-equipped functionality, the Show is compatible with Amazon's existing library of skills which ranges from ordering cabs with Uber, to controlling smart lightbulbs and thermostats, although existing skills will be audio-only until they are specifically made Show compatible.

The device is equipped with a total of eight microphones, which is one more than the existing Amazon Echo speaker. Given than the existing Echo is already pretty good at picking up our voice we're unsure why an extra microphone is needed, but it's a nice inclusion all the same.

Finally, the new device is equipped with Bluetooth, so even if your music app of choice isn't supported natively (such as Apple Music), you can still stream it to the Echo Show.

Pre-announcement leaks

We first heard rumors of the Amazon Echo Show a couple of months ago when Cnet reported that Amazon was planning on announcing a screen-equipped Echo device.

Allegedly the device, which we now know to be called the Amazon Echo Show, was planned for later in the year, but its release was pushed forward after fears that Google Home was progressing more quickly than expected.

Then, just a few days ago, AFTVnews discovered a low-resolution of the new device, codenamed the Echo 'Knight', on Amazon's servers. When they posted the discovery on Twitter, journalist Evan Blass responded with a much higher-resolution version of the same image.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

This week saw the leak of an announcement date of May 9, followed by a further leak of the price, release date, and name.

Between all these leaks, we've built up a pretty good idea of what the new device should be capable of, and most of them have now been confirmed by the official announcement.",techradar

Whether you’re looking for a high capacity battery, slim design, lots of ports or something that can charge up both your phone and your laptop, we’ve got the great portable chargers you need to see.

Just want to charge your laptop? Check out the best portable laptop chargers

Best portable chargers for capacity

Anker PowerCore

A whole 20,100mAh to play with

HUGE battery size

High speed charging

Heavy

Doesn't support Qualcomm Quick Charge

You've likely heard of Anker, and this is one of the company's best portable chargers. It comes with a huge 20,100mAh battery inside, meaning this will be able to charge up your phone or tablet multiple times before it needs a recharge.

It also comes with high-speed charging for your devices if they use PowerIQ or VoltageBoost. It won't be able to use Qualcomm's QuickCharge technology, but it'll still boost your device when you're on the go.





AUKEY Power Bank

Charge two at a time

Large battery capacity

Two USB ports

Blocky design

No quick charging

If the Anker isn't right for you, our next choice is the Aukey 20,000mAh battery pack. It features two ports so you can charge both your phone and your tablet at the same time and also has a light to show you how much battery charge is leftover.

The blocky design may not be for everyone, but this portable charger should be able to charge your phone and other gadgets a few times over with such a high capacity cell inside.

RAVPower Portable charger

Bright with a large capacity

Bright color options

Compact design

Could be smaller

This is the cheapest option for a portable charger we have on the list, but this option from RAVPower should suit you for recharging your mobile phone while on the go.

It has a capacity of 6,700mAh, which should recharge your average smartphone at least once and maybe even twice. There are three color options here with the choices of either pink, bright blue or silver.

The LEDs on the side of the device also show you how much charge is left and there's fast-charging tech built-in too.

Best slim portable chargers

Iceworks 5000mAh Portable Charger

For those looking for something slimmer

Slim design

No need to bring cables

Short charging cables

Not suitable for USB-C

If you're looking for a slim charger you can slide into your bag's front pocket, this option from Iceworks is going to suit you nicely. There's no need to carry around a cable with this version, as the charging cables are built directly into the body.

Be warned, the Iceworks 5,000mAh charger will only work with micro USB (older Android devices) and Lightning (newer iPhone models) as there's no USB-C cable on here.

Poweradd Pilot 2GS

Metal and sleek

High capacity

Quick recharge

Still quite heavy

Poweradd also offers a great slim portable charger, and it's one of the cheapest options on this list yet boasts a substantial 10,000mAh cell inside.

It may be quite heavy, but this is only 1.3cm thick, making it a great device to slip into your back pocket when you're out and about. You'll want to grab a cable to go with it though as unlike the Iceworks choice above it doesn't come with one built in.

Lepow Portable External Battery Charger

A better design than the rest

Interesting design

Super portable

Takes a while to charge

The best looking device we've chosen is the Lepow portable charger. It comes in a variety of colors and can be easily slipped into your pocket, as it's much smaller than many options on this list.

You will need to make sure you have a cable with you to connect it up to your device, but it comes with a 5,000mAh battery inside, which is enough to charge up almost any smartphone at least once.

Best portable chargers with lots of ports

MAXOAK 50000mAh

A whole six ports

Six ports

Huge battery

Large design

This may not be the most portable charger on our list, but it features a lot of ports, so you can charge multiple devices at the same time. It'll even charge laptops as well as your phone and tablet.

You can charge six devices at once, and with a 50,000mAh capacity it has the juice to do that, so if you're usually surrounded by a lot of tech this is possibly one of the best chargers to buy.

Qi-infinity Upgraded 35,000mAh Powerbank

Huge in battery and size

Four ports

35,000mAh size

Large design

Doesn't work with all laptops

Looking for a another option with lots of ports on it? This may be a good choice for you, as there are four ports and you can charge up your MacBook as well as USB devices such as your phone.

There's a quick charge port too, which will fast charge compatible devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7.

ZeroLemon ToughJuice Rugged Portable Charger

One you can throw around

Four ports

Surprisingly portable

Not a huge capacity for the price

After a rugged charger that won't break if it takes a beating? The ZeroLemon ToughJuice pack could be a great choice for you, as it comes with a solid design that isn't too large to slip into your bag or even your back pocket.

It also features four USB ports, so you're able to charge a number of devices all at the same time.

Best portable chargers for laptops and phones

RAVPower Universal Power Bank Travel Charger

One for your laptop

AC output

20,100mAh capacity

Big design

RAVPower's portable charger is a great choice if you need a device that can charge both your laptop and your phone. It features USB-C and normal USB outputs as well as an AC output, so you can plug your laptop charger directly in.

There's also a 20,100mAh capacity battery inside, so this will be able to juice up your phone or tablet multiple times before you need to put it back on charge.

Poweradd Pilot Pro2

The white option

23,000mAh capacity

Easy to see display

Not particularly portable

The picture above may be deceptive, as this isn't a small charger and is capable of charging up your laptop or tablet as well as your phone simultaneously.

You can charge up to three devices at the same time and it comes with a 23,000mAh capacity, so it should last long enough between recharges.

Bestek Car Jump Starter

Something different

Huge capacity

Can jump start a car

Not very portable

The largest charger in this category (in terms of size, though not capacity) is also one of the most innovative, as this one can even jump start your car.

It features a huge 13,600mAh battery that can give your car that much needed jolt whenever you need it to, but also comes with various ports for your phone or laptop to charge as well.",techradar
16,Kimmel 'apologizes' for saying all children deserve health care,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel is firing back at critics who slammed his recent emotional health care plea about pre-existing conditions after he revealed his newborn son was born with a heart defect. Buzz60

Jimmy Kimmel, host of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live.' (Photo: Randy Holmes, ABC)

Returning to the helm of his late-night show after taking time off to be with his newborn son, Jimmy Kimmel spoke about the viral speech he made a week ago that has racked up more than 10,000,000 views on YouTube.

The late night host explained to his audience last Monday that his son with his wife, Molly McNearney, who pens punchlines for his show, had open-heart surgery after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. At the time, Kimmel made a plea to maintain health insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.

""If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make,"" he said last week. ""I think that's something, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that.""

Last night, Kimmel thanked viewers for their donations and messages of support. He said the influx of ""so much kindness (and) so much compassion"" was difficult to process but acknowledged ""there were also some not-so-nice things that people said online about me, including members of the media.”

He shared some examples with his audience. One biting headline read, ""Jimmy Kimmel’s obscene lies about kids and medical care."" Another: ""Shut up, Jimmy Kimmel, you elitist creep.""

Matt Damon's faux nemesis was able to make a joke out of the latter.

“I cannot count the number of times I’ve been called an ‘out of touch Hollywood elitist creep’ this week, which I have to say I kind of appreciate,"" Kimmel cracked, ""because when I was a kid, we had to drink the powdered milk because we couldn’t afford the liquid. Our orange juice came frozen out of a can. It would squeeze out.”

To his opposers, he offered a sarcastic mea culpa.

""I would like to apologize for saying that children in America should have health care,"" he stated. ""It was insensitive. It was offensive, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

""There are some very sick and sad people out there,"" Kimmel continued before calling out Newt Gingrich specifically. In a clip Kimmel showed, the former speaker of the house said, ""If you show up at a hospital with a brand new baby and the brand new baby has a heart problem, the doctors at that hospital will do everything they can to save the baby. They don't say, 'We'll take care of the baby right after you write a check.' They try to save the baby's life, and that's true across the board in this country.""

Kimmel said his statement was circumstantially factual.

""Yes, it is true that if you have an emergency, they will do an operation,"" he said. ""And that’s terrific if your baby’s health problems are all solved during that one visit. The only problem is that never, ever happens. We’ve had a dozen doctors appointments since our son had surgery. You’ve got a cardiologist, the pediatrician, surgeon, some kids need an ambulance to transport them. That doesn’t even count the parents who have to miss work for all this stuff. Those details, Newt forgot to mention. I don’t know if the double layers of Spanx are restricting the blood flow to his brain.”

The show host also addressed Gingrich's opinion that late night comedians “ain't funny ‘cause they’re too angry (at President Trump) to be funny.”

“Gee, I wonder why we’re so angry,"" Kimmel began. ""Maybe it has something to do with, I don’t know, you? Listen, Newt Gingrich does know a lot about comedy. This is the guy who helped lead the impeachment effort against Bill Clinton for trying to cover his up his affair while he was having an affair. That’s hilarious. Come on. Whatever you want to say about him. Thank you, Newt. There’s a reason he’s named after a lizard, and that was it.”

16,'American Idol' to return after 2-year break ... on ABC,"Original 'American Idol' judges Randy Jackson, left, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell returned for the series finale on Fox in 2016. (Photo: Matt Sayles, AP)

This ... is American Idol, on a new network.

The singing competition, which set ratings records over a storied 15-year run on Fox but was canceled last spring, is being resurrected on ABC.

The Disney-owned network confirmed the news early Tuesday, providing no details about judges, a host, timing or the duration of the series, though it's been speculated that a shortened season will begin next spring on Sunday nights. The show's previous seasons, about 20 weeks each, stretched from mid-January to mid-May.

TMZ first reported Idol producers FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainment's talks with ABC after earlier discussions with NBC ended.

As for who might be back?

TMZ says Ryan Seacrest, who joined the Disney family only last week as the new co-host of Live with Kelly!, ""seems interested"" in returning as host, though Seacrest Monday played coy on Live!, saying, ""I don't know if I can host it.""

If the show remains in Los Angeles, as expected, Seacrest would have to jet back and forth each week during live Idol episodes. But Live!'s previous co-host, Michael Strahan, did the same thing each week during NFL season, when he moonlighted as a host of Fox NFL Sunday in Los Angeles, though the weekend gig didn't pose as direct a conflict.

Simon Cowell, the judge who vaulted the show to fame, is now executive producer and a judge on NBC's America's Got Talent. NBC is also the new network home of fellow judge Jennifer Lopez, who has a major deal to produce and star in a new reality-competition series, World of Dance (premiering May 30) in addition to her current detective drama Shades of Blue.

Idol was the top-rated show for eight seasons of its run, peaking in its fifth with an average of more than 30 million viewers (and 36 million for its May performance finale). But by the end of its run, Idol drew only about one-third of that audience, even as the show's expenses — some judges were paid $15 million a season — skyrocketed. Fox announced a planned final season in 2015, and the show ended its run only last May, after NBC's The Voice had eclipsed it.

While ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey, in a statement, called Idol ""a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon,"" former executive producer Nigel Lythgoe expressed skepticism about the speedy return, telling Variety, ""it feels a little too soon to bring it back."" But ABC has been struggling on Sundays with dramas, ranks fourth among the major networks and with no NFL contract, can sorely use another reality hit. And all of the networks have struggled in recent attempts to launch new unscripted hits; NBC's Little Big Shots,which started strongly, already has faded in its second season.

Although ABC found success adapting two other British reality hits, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Dancing with the Stars, it has failed in several attempts to clone Idol. Among the notorious bombs were The One: Making a Music Star, a costly summer series that opened with 3 million viewers and was canceled after two weeks in 2006; and Rising Star,which aired in 2014 and featured contestants singing behind partitions. But Idol has a built-in (if faded) fan base, and the reboot will likely be heavily promoted during ABC's Oscar telecast, typically the highest-rated entertainment program each year.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is proposing to counter the resilient Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan by adding thousands more U.S. troops, putting them closer to combat and pounding militants with more airstrikes, according to a senior Defense official.

There are about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, down from the peak of 100,000 in 2010-'11. The request for at least 3,000 more American combat forces to bolster battered Afghan security forces was signaled earlier this year when the top U.S. commander there, Army Gen. John Nicholson, told the Senate the security situation had deteriorated.

The military's proposal, which requires White House approval, would allow U.S. troops to partner with Afghan forces closer to the fight, said the Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan. U.S. troops in Afghanistan have dual responsibilities: advising Afghan security forces and a counter-terrorism mission against al Qaeda and Islamic State terrorists.

Late last month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Kabul to hear directly from Nicholson. Mattis' visit came days after an attack by a Taliban-affiliated militant killed 140 Afghan troops, most of whom were unarmed in a mosque praying at their base.

Under the Obama administration, the Pentagon had been moving to end its presence in Afghanistan dating to 2001. Then, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, U.S. forces helped topple the Taliban government that had given shelter to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist organization.

But pleas from U.S. commanders about the tenuous security situation prompted President Barack Obama to reverse course and leave the current force in place. However, there have been restrictions on how close Americans could accompany Afghan forces in combat and on bombing Taliban targets. Those rules were eased last year, and the Pentagon's proposal would grant added authority for air strikes.

Watch the MOAB blast:

Mattis also learned on his trip from U.S. intelligence officials that the Taliban have been receiving increased munitions shipments, including machine guns, and funding from Russia. Nicholson also acknowledged reports of Russian assistance to the Taliban.

An added complication in Afghanistan is the presence of Islamic State fighters, known as ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K. Nicholson attacked the insurgents with one of the largest conventional munitions in the U.S. arsenal, the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or MOAB, also referred to as the Mother of All Bombs.

The U.S.-led coalition has killed more 538 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan since March. The strikes have reduced ISIS strength from about 3,000 militants in 2015 to about 800 today, according to the military official.

The fight with ISIS-K claimed the lives of two U.S. Army Rangers late last month.

For those who think the original Oreo is too dull, Nabisco is offering $500,000 to the winner of its next Oreo flavor. (Photo: Nabisco)

For those who think original Oreos are too boring, Nabisco has announced the chocolate sandwich cookie's newest flavor: the Firework Oreo.

Cosmopolitan magazine describes it as “an Oreo with Pop Rocks in the creme."" It's not the real Pop Rocks carbonated candy that baby boomers grew up with — Pop Rocks were invented in 1956 — but red and blue sprinkles that the packaging describes as a popping candy.

Food & Wine magazine received an advance package of the cookies and had staffers try them.

""As it turns out, much like actual fireworks, they’re relatively enjoyable and kind of fun for while,"" writer Adam Campbell-Schmitt wrote. ""The Firework Oreos are basically your classic cream-filled cookie. There’s no real taste difference, just a slight gritty texture from the popping candies in the frosting although not as grainy as the sugar-laced Peeps Oreos from this Easter.""

The delayed reaction of the popping candy is a nice surprise, he wrote.

► February: Yup, Peeps-flavored Oreos are here

► 2015: Indiana woman's biscuit chip tastes like a million bucks

► 2014: Lay's brings back its create-a-flavor contest

But officials at the subsidiary of Mondelez International (MDLZ) also are taking a page from Lay's succession of Do Us a Flavor contests for limited-edition potato chips, announcing a $500,000 prize for its next Oreo flavor. The Oreo contest runs through July 14.

They'll be taking submissions through Twitter and Instagram using #MyOreoCreation and #Contest hashtags.

Some people couldn't wait to get started:

16,"'Dancing with the Stars': Bonner bows out, Normani dominates the night","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Everyone’s favorite cowboy Bonner Bolton saw his last ride. USA TODAY

Welcome back to Dancing with the Why Is Bonner Bolton Still Here?

Okay, that’s harsh, but guys. Here we are in this strange Dancing with the Stars final five that should probably have Nancy Kerrigan in it and definitely should have had Heather Morris, but we’re left with a seemingly predictable final three in Normani, Rashad and Simone. But for Bonner Bolton it was the final night of dancing. He tried, but his deficit stood out too much. As we hurl ourselves toward a new mirror ball champ, let’s review:

Normani Kordei and Valentin Chmerkovskiy (with Alan Bernstein)

Contemporary/Jive Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 40/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 39/40

Val chooses a song called Freedom for Normani because of past abuse she's experienced online — whatever pain she had to dip into paid off because her contemporary was as emotionally succinct as it was technically flawless. And it seemed everyone took note — Normani solidified a well-deserved perfect score for her Contemporary, and her Jive offered nothing less. If Normani loses this season, it’s a crime.

Saved you two weeks: @NormaniKordei is your #DWTS winner. No contest. pic.twitter.com/foeaOnqyCa — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) May 9, 2017

Rashad Jennings and Emma Slater (with Witney Carson)

Jive/Argentine Tango Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 36/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 39/40

With this we get some insight into their connection, and it appears that Rashad is a real life angel! But as nice as he is, that jive wasn’t his best. Of course, there were staple kicks and flicks, and the first jump-over-and nearly-land-on-a dancer’s-head move, but it’s not his prime. However his Argentine Tango trio was FIRE with Emma and Witney. The footwork was nearly perfect, but the chemistry? It needs no comment.

Simone Biles and Sasha Farber (with Brittany Cherry)

Foxtrot/Paso Doble Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 36/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 36/40

To quote what my dad texted at me in all caps last week, “SIMONE WAS ROBED.” We assume that means “robbed,” but America agrees, and so does Sasha who chose What Makes You Beautiful for their Foxtrot this week. She continues to be technically perfect, however that Olympian emotional breakthrough? It doesn’t feel like it’s quite yet happened. But on that Paso Doble? Simone looks like a true champion, but the judges still say she’s too perfect.

David Ross and Lindsay Arnold (with Hayley Erbert)

Waltz/Paso Doble Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 36/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 29/40

So, God love Lindsay for choosing Humble and Kind for David because he’s, wait for it, humble and kind. But the moment of the season so far is Lindsay dancing on David’s actual feet. You see—David and Bonner’s main difference is that David has progressed. Does he deserve Simone’s score? Probably not. But he’s earned it. Does that make sense? Neither does this dance floor. On the final dance of the night, David’s gladiator inspired Paso to Gangsta’s Paraside, is surprisingly epic, yet adorably amateur. To quote David, “That stinks.”

Bonner Bolton and Sharna Burgess (with Britt Stewart)

Argentine Tango/Jazz Trio

Round 1 Judges Scores: 30/40

Round 2 Judges Scores: 28/40

Sharna chose an Imagine Dragons song for Bonner because why should his run on DWTS start making sense now? On dance night, Bonner doesn’t particularly miss any steps, but there’s a fluidity that’s missing from his dancing that isn’t lining up with the other contestants. And Len even comments that he’s gone a week too far. DANG, LEN. On trio night, their CEO/sexual secretary gimmick feels weird... just a lot of money and side-butt and grinding.

Basically if Bonner stays this week he'd have to make up a margin almost double the biggest margin ever made up on #dwts — Claire Charness (@clairecharness) May 9, 2017

USA TODAY Sparkle Points Podium

David Ross: 5/5

We see you, David! Your muted lavender suit with rhinestones. Your sleeveless gladiator-dad realness. It’s an adventurous choice for a waltz to a country song about fatherhood, but if you’re dad is super fierce and not afraid of a pastel color palette, it’s perfection. And that warrior Paso? This is David’s Sparta, and we’re just living in it.

Nothing says gladiator time like a Trios Paso! @D_Ross3, @lindsayarnold and @Dance10Hayley are up next! #DWTS ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/j5axcEIqbu — Official DWTS (@DancingABC) May 9, 2017

Rashad Jennings: 4/5

Matching black suits aren’t usually worth calling attention to, but look past your bias and into Rashad’s dancing truth, and you’ll see that both the jacket and tie are bedazzled, and that’s worth noting.

Normani Kordei: 4/5

A quiet, somber Contemporary was followed by a country-bumpkin jive with as much skin-revealing flannel as the eye could see, and sometimes, the most sparkle points are awarded to those who show the most abs. To Val and Alan, we thank you for your service to Normani’s Jive.

9,The NBA playoffs are boring. That's not necessarily a bad thing. | FOX Sports,"It’s been 24 days since the start of the NBA playoffs and it’s 24 days until the NBA Finals begin on June 1, meaning we’re somehow only in the middle of the inexorable slog to the NBA Finals showdown. You know, the one everybody has been expecting and anticipating since the end of the last year’s postseason – Golden State vs. Cleveland.

That perceived inevitability of a Finals rematch has essentially spoiled any drama from the first three rounds. Highlights like Isaiah Thomas’s 53-point explosion are entirely isolated, standing almost no chance of having any greater meaning beyond that specific game on that specific night. It might as well be the regular season. There’s no future that doesn’t have LeBron facing off against the Warriors on the first night of June and because of that the NBA playoffs have nothing at stake, rendering the great moments irrelevant and creating a vacuum of hype that’ll continue for the rest of the month.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports

This is a common refrain – up there with “the playoffs are too long,” “the regular season is too long” and “how is that not a travel?” In both 2015 and 2016 the identical topic was discussed with some regularity. But this year, with two equally dominant teams relative to their conference, it’s on another level. Players are even weighing in, with Golden State’s Draymond Green complaining (for some reason) about the level of competition the Cavs have faced through their “boring” eight-for-eight playoff start.

“I thought [Cleveland opponents] would compete a little harder. […] I like to watch good basketball. When you watch them play, you only watching one side of good basketball. That’s kind of weak.”

Says the guy whose team just completed its own double sweep of the first and second rounds.

That doesn’t mean he’s wrong. Neither the Cavs nor Warriors have played an interesting game yet. The former is a -600 favorite to win the East while the latter is a staggering -1000 to win the West. Those are insane numbers. To put them into context, when the Patriots played the Browns last October, the money line was -550. It’s a sure thing.

It’s true that even without predetermined finals, the playoffs have been, by any measure, a snooze. Rockets-Thunder was far more fun to anticipate and theorize about than it was to watch. Celtics-Bulls had the makings of a classic until Rajon Rondo got hurt. Clippers-Jazz went seven but the finale was a complete dud for a series that lost everything off its fastball when Blake Griffin went down. Raptors-Bucks gave us a Giannis game or two … but to be honest I’ve all but forgotten it.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that. A boring first 48 days for a stellar Finals is a trade-off anyone would make. Excitement and upsets early lead to lower quality later. Consider the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament: On the first weekend, we love the surprises and Cinderella dancing her way to the Sweet 16. Bracket chaos is wanted and welcome. But then you get to the Sweet 16 and it’s Kansas vs. Middle Tennessee State and all of a sudden you’re retroactively wishing the first two rounds had been more chalk.

If the seemingly endless playoffs are setting the stage for the classic NBA Finals series we all expect, why risk the potential greatness of that series for the greatness of another one with far lower stakes? Who cares if Rockets-Spurs ends in an anticlimactic fashion as long as it doesn’t get in the way of Warriors-Cavs?

The ideal, I suppose, is getting high drama without affecting the endgame. If this were a script, you’d write the Warriors struggling early in the Western Conference Finals, playing shorthanded after Draymond Green makes history by simultaneously hitting two opponents in their respective groins at the same exact time and and, for a moment anyway, allowing for the dream of a monumental upset late in the series. In the East, the Wizards and Cavs could throw down like they did back from 2006-08, complete with battle raps, LeBron beefs and the reemergence of Gilbert Arenas. We’d still get Warriors-Cavs but at least there’d be some potholes and memories made along the way.

But this isn’t a movie and the reality is that the Warriors are going to win the West in four or five and either the Wizards or Celtics will be rewarded a moral victory if they can push LeBron to six. That’s fine. It’d be nicer to have some more excitement along the way or to have the ability to fast-forward through the beginning and middle to get to the end, yes, but playoff basketball is playoff basketball. It’s like pizza; even when it’s bad it’s not that bad. Instant gratification is overrated anyway.

9,Ranking the best baseball towns in (North) America | FOX Sports,"This is not an easy list. How do you determine a great baseball town?

With attendance? Too simplistic.

By atmosphere? It's hard to get rowdy when your team isn't any good.

By scarcity? A one-sport town is going to have an advantage, but that doesn't mean it'll take it.

By jersey sales? You don't have to live in Chicago to have a Kris Bryant jersey.

It's an amalgamation of all of it, and it's an inexact science at best. But as someone who has been to all but a small handful of Major League parks (the two Pennsylvania yards, Citi Field, and the new Braves' suburban home) I feel marginally qualified (which is about as good as you can get) to amalgamate those things into an overall ranking.

It wasn't easy — not by a long shot — and it will probably offend the easily offended.

But this is the list.

So with apologies to Pittsburgh (a football town, first and foremost, then hockey), Seattle (a great place to see a game, but ultimately a Seahawks and outdoors town), Milwaukee (it's all about the Packers, even in the summer), Washington (not enough of a track record, but it's getting there), Minneapolis (great park, but it's clearly a Vikings' town), and Philadelphia (it's all about the Eagles, baby), here are the top 13 baseball towns in North America.",fox-sports

9,Sidney Crosby's post-concussion return is only getting more uncomfortable | FOX Sports,"Whether or not Sidney Crosby suffered another head injury during Monday night’s Game 6 in Pittsburgh remains up in the air.

What’s maybe more mysterious, though, is the way that the situation was handled.

During the first period, Crosby took a brutal headfirst spill into the boards and was slow to get up. He looked dazed when he finally got to his feet. Still, he finished his shift and played the rest of the game.

That’s not a credit to him being “a warrior” or glorifying his ability to play through it, something that’s often done in hockey. This…this was uncomfortable. Uncomfortable to watch, uncomfortable to follow, uncomfortable to think about.

At 29 years old, Crosby is already one of the best and most accomplished hockey players of this generation. He has two Stanley Cups, a Conn Smythe, two Hart Trophies, two Art Ross trophies, two Rocket Richard trophies, six NHL All-Star nods, two Olympic gold medals and a slew of other honors.

He also already has an unsettlingly long history of head injuries.",fox-sports
9,Why this summer's trade market could be even more intriguing than usual | FOX Sports,"So, what if the Blue Jays, Rangers and Giants really do stink and end up sellers at the non-waiver deadline?

A buyer’s market could emerge, one that could even include some of the rebuilding clubs as sneaky players.

The Braves already plan to act as buyers and sellers, and the Reds also would consider adding controllable pieces, according to major-league sources.

The Phillies, Brewers, Twins and Padres conceivably might take similar approaches, but an executive from one of those clubs says that July is not the best time for such teams to make significant upgrades.

“The July market tends to be more emotional than the offseason market,” the exec said. “So, it seems unlikely that an out-of-contention team would be the most motivated to swing a trade like that. Not impossible, but unlikely.”

Obviously, the performances of each club will help determine their strategies. The Reds, for example, probably would be more compelled to act if they remained in contention – unlikely, considering their 5.29 rotation ERA is the highest in the majors.

In any case, this will be a different market, if only because of the new rules regarding draft-pick compensation for free agents who reject qualifying offers and sign with new clubs.

Unlike in the past, only a revenue-sharing recipient will receive a pick immediately following the first round for such a player – and only if the free agent signs a contract for a total guarantee of $50 million or more.

All other circumstances will yield lower picks, reducing the incentive for teams that are out of contention to carry players to free agency; the better returns would come in trades.

The non-waiver deadline is nearly three months away. Teams will not get serious about trades until after the amateur draft, which runs from June 12 to 14. But things will be interesting. Things always are interesting.

The dynamics are different every year.

YANKEES FOR REAL?

Well, yeah, but offensive regression seems inevitable.

The Yankees rank first in the American League with a .317 batting average on balls in play; the major-league average is .292. Starlin Castro (.400 BABIP), Matt Holliday (.345) and Chase Headley (.342) are hitting into particularly good luck, while Aaron Judge, Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner also are a good bit above the league average.

Judge’s average exit velocity, which ranks fourth in the majors, helps produce a high BABIP, but as one rival exec puts it, “Every Yankee right now looks like his best self.”

I wouldn’t go that far – we’ve yet to see the best of Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius, both of whom missed significant time with injuries. But only six teams have outperformed their weighted on-base average to a greater extent than the Yankees, according to exit velocity/launch angle data on Statcast.

One also could argue that the Yankees’ rotation also is bound to regress, whether through injury, inconsistency or both. The team boasts numerous alternatives at Double-A and Triple-A, but Jordan Montgomery likely will face an innings restriction of some kind.

A trade for another starter almost certainly will be a consideration if the Yankees remain in contention.

HERE COME … THE MARINERS?

The Mariners, who have gone 13-9 since opening the season 2-8, might actually be in position to challenge the Astros once four significant players return from injuries.

Reliever Steve Cishek could be back this weekend, while right-hander Felix Hernandez, left-hander James Paxton and right fielder Mitch Haniger could return on the next homestand, which runs from May 15 to 21, general manager Jerry Dipoto said.

That’s the most optimistic scenario, assuming no setbacks. But the Mariners, despite their multitude of injuries, rank third in the AL in runs per game and fourth in rotation ERA. Their bullpen numbers are far less attractive, but part of that is due to poor performances by journeymen and youngsters who were pressed into unexpected duty.

The M’s, believe it or not, already have used 12 rookies, matching the Reds for the most in the majors. Two others, closer Edwin Diaz and left-hander Ariel Miranda, have less than one year of service.

“That is why I always refuted the idea that we had blown up the farm system,” said Dipoto, who made 13 trades involving 36 players during the offseason. “What we did is take the lower levels and turn it into the upper levels. Right now, it’s really benefiting us.”

Still, the Mariners’ start has been jarring, to say the least. In addition to the injuries, they’ve demoted two Opening Day starters, center fielder Leonys Martin and catcher Mike Zunino, and gone from Danny Valencia to Dan Vogelbach back to Valencia at first base.

Can the Mariners threaten the Astros?

I’ll believe it when I see it, but it’s not out of the question that the M’s will turn their season around.

Dipoto, while highly complimentary of the Astros, said, “If you lined up all the worst-case scenarios for us, they all hit … this guy’s hurt, that guy’s hurt, this guy under-performed.

“For the Astros, the opposite happened. They got the Cy Young version of Dallas Keuchel. Lance McCullers is really good. Their bullpen is terrific,” Dipoto continued, overlooking the Astros’ one significant injury, to righty Collin McHugh. “If their pitching is as good as we think it is – and I think it is excellent, particularly once they get into the middle of the game and can launch (Chris) Devenski and shorten the game up – it is particularly ominous.

“We’ve also seen Cleveland – they’ve got that dynamic bullpen. Those two teams are exceptional, we understand they are that good. But we can’t focus on anybody else in the situation we’re in. We’ve got to play day by day and hopefully hold our ground while these guys heal up. So far, we’ve been able to do that.”

THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE CUBS …

A team’s record in one-run games is not necessarily a reflection of its overall strength; most executives believe that luck plays a significant role in one-run decisions, with outcomes often dictated by a pitch here or a hit there.

A better measure of a team’s quality is how often it blows out an opponent, which brings us to the 2017 Cubs, who are 16-15 after 31 games as opposed to 25-6 a year ago.

The Cubs last season were an astonishing 42-13 in games decided by five or more runs. They finished the season with a run differential of plus-252, the highest in the majors since the 2001 Mariners were plus-300.

This season? Different story so far.

The Cubs’ run differential is only plus-10, and they’re 3-3 in games decided by five or more runs. The improvement of the Reds and Brewers also is tightening the NL Central. The Cubs, after going 50-25 against the Central last season, are 10-8 within the division thus far.

LET’S DREAM ABOUT THE REDS …

After all, it might be the last chance we get.

Seriously, what happens if this team patches together a rotation? It’s not out of the question – left-hander Brandon Finnegan and right-hander Homer Bailey could return in late June, righty Anthony DeSclafani in July.

The Reds, second in the NL only to the Nationals in runs per game, are proving they can hit, even though first baseman Joey Votto is their only regular with a lengthy track record.

Their bullpen – thanks to the dominance of righty Raisel Iglesias, emergence of lefty Wandy Peralta and creative usage by manager Bryan Price, among other reasons – has gone from the worst in the game to, at least thus far, one of the best in the NL.

Perhaps the most interesting development, though, is the performance of the Reds’ defense.

The Reds actually were quite good defensively last season, ranking seventh in the majors in converting balls in play into outs. This year, though, they are first, with shortstop Zack Cozart and third baseman Eugenio Suarez ranking among the leaders at their positions in defensive runs saved. (Suarez currently rates as the top third baseman, and second only to Cubs shortstop Addison Russell among all infielders).

Cozart, earning $5.325 million in his walk year, remains a prime candidate to be traded no matter where the Reds are in the standings. Second baseman Jose Peraza can move to short, enabling the Reds to promote second baseman Dilson Herrera from Triple-A.

AROUND THE HORN

*Infield defense remains a concern for the Diamondbacks, who rank 24th in the majors in converting balls in play into outs. Second baseman Brandon Drury, shortstop Chris Owings and third baseman Jake Lamb all rate as negatives in defensive runs saved.

All of those players, though, are 26-and-under, so it’s not as if improvement is out of the question. Drury, in particular, is relatively new to his position, and one club official compares his intensity and work ethic to that of an NHL captain.

Nick Ahmed is Gold Glove-caliber when he starts at short (he actually has played more innings at the position than Owings, who also has filled in at second while producing an .833 OPS). And Ketel Marte, who is playing well at Triple-A, could enter the middle-infield equation at some point this season.

*Good to see Rays shortstop Tim Beckham, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 draft, finally gain some traction in the majors while replacing the injured Matt Duffy.

Beckham’s on-base percentage is just .284, but his OPS is .766 in part due to his six home runs. He also has rated as a plus defensively.

Duffy is expected to return from left-heel surgery in late May. He almost certainly will not be ready to assume a full load immediately, and Beckham’s versatility should help him get continued playing time – he can play all four infield positions and left field.

*Cody Bellinger has electrified the Dodgers with his power and athleticism, raising questions about where he will play once first baseman Adrian Gonzalez returns from right elbow soreness – good questions for the club, obviously.

Right fielder Yasiel Puig remains his usual intriguing self – excellent defensively, inconsistent offensively. Puig’s groundball percentage is the highest of his career, and he has grounded into a major-league high 11 double plays.

9,"Exclusive: Hendrick engineer shares journey to NASCAR, working with Dale Earnhardt Jr. | FOX Sports","If you put in the work and put yourself in the right position, you can make your dreams a reality.

That’s exactly what Travis Peterson did. He went from being a young kid in Wisconsin who rooted for Dale Earnhardt Sr. to one of the main people in charge of setting up the No. 88 Chevrolet as a race engineer for Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Hendrick Motorsports.

After graduating from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Peterson made a connection with Greg Ives and became his race engineer on the No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet driven by Regan Smith in 2013.

That was the first time he met his new boss, Dale Jr.

“It was really funny (the first time meeting Dale Jr.),” Peterson told FOXSports.com. “I was at JR Motorsports, a few days into working there and I was in the shop. He walked up to talk to someone I was working with and he goes ‘hey man, I don’t know you yet.’ I introduced myself and he says, ‘well, I’m Dale.’ And I thought, ‘I appreciate you giving me a full-blown introduction, but I know who you are. Your name is on the door.’”

Since entering the sport in 2013, Peterson has worked with Ives and Earnhardt, winning the XFINITY Series championship with Chase Elliott in 2014 and then moving up to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series in 2015.

Through that time, Peterson has learned what it is that makes Earnhardt such a fan favorite.

“He’s just so normal. I think that’s what people see in him and why he’s a fan favorite and so many people like him,” Peterson told FOXSports.com “He’s a normal every day you and me type of guy. That’s the way he lives his life. He walks around the shop in a t-shirt every day and talks to people and sees how they are. That’s the way it still is. We cut up in the lounge and have a good time and he’s a fun guy to be around.”

Peterson always had aspirations to work in NASCAR but has to pinch himself sometimes when he’s working at Hendrick Motorsports with Dale Earnhardt Jr. and so many of NASCAR’s most well-respected people.

“It’s funny because my dad was a Dale Earnhardt fan and watching races with dad, I grew up a Dale Sr. fan,” Peterson told FOXSports.com. “It’s funny now to sit back and look at it in perspective. It’s kind of comical in a ‘how far we’ve come’ from a small town in Wisconsin to working with Dale Earnhardt Jr.”

Travis’ dad, Tom, works at Joe Gibbs Racing as a manual machinist and is a driving force behind Travis working in the sport.

“My dad was trying to get into the sport for a long time,” Peterson told FOXSports.com “He knew people at Richard Childress Racing and was trying to get a job there. That never panned out. We would travel to the races at least twice a year and go to the race and hang out. He was meeting people and trying to get in the door. When I was going into 8th grade, he got a job with Joe Gibbs Racing and moved to Charlotte.”

Peterson cheered when he got the news that his family was moving because his dad got a job in NASCAR and realized he had the chance to make his dream a reality, too.

At age 26, Peterson has accomplished a lot at a young age but feels like he belongs after slowly working his way into the industry with his dad.

“I slowly trickled into doing it all,” Peterson told FOXSports.com “I went from being a fan as a kid, then I went with my dad when I turned 18 and went to Darlington with him into the garage. He was on the No. 18 car (Kyle Busch) at the time and they won Darlington in the Indiana Jones paint scheme (2008) and I got to be in the pits and experience Victory Lane and go with him as often as I could. Then, doing internships and it slowly progressed to where it is now and it all seems so natural.”

9,Kevin Garnett explains why Ray Allen wasn’t invited on the Celtics’ reunion tour | FOX Sports,"It’s been known for some time now that Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and the rest of the NBA champion 2008 Celtics team aren’t crazy about Ray Allen. The rift began in 2012, when Allen left Boston to join LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade with the Heat, leaving one star-laden team for another.

The fact that the Heat knocked the Celtics out of the playoffs in back-to-back years before Allen left didn’t help.

Now, with several former Celtics players from the championship squad reuniting, everyone is asking about Allen’s whereabouts. The fact of the matter is he wasn’t invited to join his former teammates on a “reunion tour,” of sorts, and Kevin Garnett explained Monday night why that is.

“Everybody’s asking us, ‘Where’s Ray?’” Garnett said on his TNT segment, “Area 21.” “People don’t understand that this is real life for us, and the situation with Ray is very sensitive. I think when we all talked about doing this reunion tour, we talked about guys we consider loyal and part of this group. Just being honest, my two cents, man, when Ray decided to go to the Heat, I felt like he moved on. And he went to pursue another ring, and he got another ring. Shout out to him. And that’s it. It wasn’t no other Wizards, it wasn’t no other Spurs, it wasn’t no other Heat … it was all Celtics invited to this.”

“It was more than basketball for us… It felt like a sour breakup.” Pierce, KG, Rondo, Big Baby & Perk share their thoughts on Ray Allen. pic.twitter.com/8JYRWmxm0i — KG's Area 21 (@KGArea21) May 9, 2017

Is that a reasonable explanation? People will have different opinions, but it seems a bit unfair for the Celtics to completely exclude Allen, considering what happened in the years after he left.

Garnett and Paul Pierce were traded to the Nets one year after Allen joined the Heat, hoping to recreate what they had with the Celtics in Brooklyn. That lasted only a year before Pierce signed with the Wizards and Garnett was traded to the Timberwolves during the 2014-15 season.

So the “band” could have stuck together longer if Allen had stayed, but the Celtics were disassembled one year after his departure anyway.

“I was initially hurt by the whole way everything went down,” Pierce said. “Like, I don’t have no beef with none of my teammates or nothing. I was just hurt [by] how it went down.

“We all came together, we talked about it, we talked every day, we hung out all the time. And then when it was time for free agency – and to each his own in free agency – but I thought we formed a brotherhood here in Boston and just how we carried ourselves not only on the court but off it. … That’s what I was hurt by, when Ray didn’t just at least give us a heads up about it.”

AP

Pierce continued by saying “now it’s uncomfortable” and that he hasn’t talked to Allen in years. And don’t expect Garnett, Pierce or Kendrick Perkins to be the first to try to mend fences.

“At this point in time, I don’t think it’s on nobody on here to break the ice. I actually think it’s on Ray to break the ice,” Perkins said. “If Ray want to make amends with anybody up here, or whatever the case, I think it’s on him to reach out and say, ‘Hey, P, I handled this wrong. We better than this.’ ‘Hey, Ticket, I handled this wrong.’ ‘Hey, Big Baby, I handled this wrong.’ ‘Hey Rondo, I handled this wrong.’ And just get it past us. We won games together.”

We may never see the trio of Garnett, Pierce and Allen together again, which is a bit disappointing because they were so much fun to watch when they brought the Celtics their last championship.",fox-sports

9,Alex Ovechkin could have quit when he was dropped to the third line. He didn’t. | FOX Sports,"For whatever reason, this isn't the biggest story in hockey right now. It’s unclear if this is because it’s really not that big a deal – who cares what line you’re on? – or if this is just hockey writers and announcers buying into the whole next man up thing and not wanting to make a thing out of it. NBC’s Jeremy Roenick was one of the few to address it bluntly, saying: “It’s a big demotion. If I’m him … if I’m going down to the third line, I’m going to be out of my mind — irate and mad.”

To me, at least, it’s the most fascinating story of the postseason. Alex Ovechkin, a true superstar, one of the most important NHL figures over the last decade and a half, was told to put on a white shirt at practice, the shirt designated for the third liners, and to do so for the lead-up to two do-or-die games for the franchise which he is the face of … and he didn’t quit. He didn’t throw a tantrum. He didn’t sulk.

9,Does Ryan Howard's Triple-A release signal the end for the former MVP? | FOX Sports,"Ryan Howard is a free agent once again after having been released from his minor-league contract with the Atlanta Braves.

Howard was hitting .184/238/.263 with a homer, five RBI and 11 strikeouts in 42 plate appearances for the Braves’ Triple-A affiliate in Gwinnett. He had hoped to hit well enough to earn a spot as a left-handed bat on the bench for Atlanta, but now the 37-year-old slugger must contemplate his options, which could include retirement.

After spending his entire career with the Phillies – 13 seasons in the majors after being drafted in the fifth round by Philadelphia in 2001 – Howard didn’t attract much attention on the free-agent market this past offseason. He eventually settled for a minor-league deal with the Braves in early April.

The 2005 NL Rookie of the Year and 2006 NL MVP is a career .258/.343/.515 hitter with 382 homers and 1,194 RBI. In his final season in Philly in 2016, he hit just .196/.257/.453 with 25 homers and 59 RBI in 112 games.

6,Watch: Sally Yates and Ted Cruz go head-to-head on Trump's travel ban,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share When Ted Cruz questioned former acting Attorney General Sally Yates for not supporting Donald Trump's temporary travel ban, she was ready to defend her position. USA TODAY

Former acting attorney general Sally Yates and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went head-to-head into a heated exchanged over the President’s travel ban Monday.

Yates was fired as acting attorney general for refusing to carry out the President’s first iteration of a travel ban in January. During a Senate hearing on Monday, Cruz questioned Yates over her refusal to carry out the president’s travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Cruz read a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president the power to bar immigrants from the country if it’s in the best interest of the country.

“Would you agree that is broad statutory authorization,” Cruz asked.

Yates fired back that she was familiar with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and spouted out another statue.

“I am also familiar with an additional provision of the INA, that says no person shall receive preference or be discriminated against in issuance of a visa because of race, nationality or place of birth,” she said. “That I believe was promulgated after the statue you just quoted and that’s been part of the discussion with the courts, with respect to the INA, was whether this more specific statue trumps the first one you just described.”

Yates said her original concern was not over the Immigration and Nationality Act, but whether the president’s executive order violated the Constitution.

“But my concern was not an INA concern here; it rather was a constitutional concern whether or not ... the executive order here violated the Constitution specifically with the establishment clause and equal protection and due process,"" she said.

More coverage:

Yates also claimed that the Office of Legal Counsel, the Justice Department office that advises the president on legal matters and had previously approved Trump’s order, was specifically instructed not share its deliberations with Yates and other interim Justice leadership before the travel ban was made public.

She did not detail who instructed the OLC not to share its views with her and other top Justice officials.

""Not only were we not consulted, we weren't even told about it,'' Yates told Cruz.

Yates said she was “not convinced that [the travel ban] was lawful.”

16,Fox News' Shepard Smith: I didn't out myself; I was never in,"""When I told the truth, I guess it was considered that I outed myself,"" Smith says. ""I didn’t even think about it, because I didn’t think I was in.” (Photo: Richard Drew, AP)

It's taken two solid weeks for Shepard Smith's comments about his homosexuality at the University of Mississippi to get national pickup, but in a way, that's fitting for a man who, for the last decade, never really saw himself as being in the closet.

Smith addressed the elephant in the Fox newsroom during an April 21 speech at Ole Miss' Meek School of Journalism, where he was once a student. Sitting in the audience: his father, stepfather and his partner.

The Holly Springs, Miss., native said that for his college years and the first two decades of his career, he didn't hide his sexuality so much as he just steered clear of the issue entirely. He poured himself into his work because he was unprepared to deal with the consequences.

“A. You’re going to hell for it,” he said, listing the reasons he avoided the subject. “B. You’ll never have any friends again. C. What are you going to tell your family? And by the way, you’re on television on the craziest conservative network on Earth,” he joked.”That will probably put you in front of a brick wall. Of course, none of that was true, but that’s how it felt.”

That, he explained, was ""why it wasn’t until seven, or eight, or nine years ago, I started living my truth ... And when I told the truth, I guess it was considered that I outed myself. I didn’t even think about it because I didn’t think I was in.”

Things did get better after that point.

""Once I figured it all out, I wasn’t hiding anything,"" he told the audience. ""I was always as true to me as I knew how to be. If I was fibbing to you, it’s because I was fibbing to me. And I didn’t realize I was fibbing to you because I didn’t know I was fibbing to me. And I know that sounds like such a load of (expletive), but it really is my truth. And I don’t have to fib about anything ever again as long as I live and that really makes everything so much easier.”

For Smith, his sexuality is both important and a non-issue.

“I don’t think about it,” he said. “It’s not a thing. I go to work. I manage a lot of people. I cover the news. I deal with holy hell around me. I go home to the man I’m in love with.""

But don't go assigning any gay stereotypes to him, warns the Ole Miss fans.

""On a Saturday, I don't (care) about brunch,"" he laughed. ""I respect you and your brunch. You should enjoy the brunch. The drag queens will be great. I'll be at (Ole Miss') Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. Because that's where I need to be. And later, I need to watch ESPN for the rest of the day ... But it's harder when you like boys to find other people to roll like this. Until you put them on a private jet and bring them here.""

6,Comey's claim to Congress about Clinton aide's emails wasn't true,"Story highlights The emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner's computer via a backup system for Abedin's phone

The discovery of the emails last October prompted Comey to alert Congress

Washington (CNN) FBI Director James Comey erroneously told Congress last week that former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop -- and the bureau is looking for a way to clean up the error, according to officials familiar with the matter.

The emails were forwarded to Anthony Weiner's computer via a backup system for her phone, US officials told CNN last fall. Some, though far fewer than the ""hundreds and thousands"" Comey described, may have been sent in order to be printed, the officials say.

The emails weren't marked as classified, though the FBI later found classified information contained in some emails recovered from Weiner's laptop. The discovery of the emails last October prompted Comey to alert Congress, days before the presidential election, that the FBI had reopened its probe of Clinton's private email server.

Some Democrats and Clinton herself have blamed her election loss at least partly on Comey's decision to update Congress about the newly found emails. The FBI ended its investigation of the emails without changing its conclusion that no charges should be brought against Clinton or anyone else.

Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the former secretary of state, compared Comey's statements to Clinton's marathon testimony at a 2015 hearing over the Benghazi terrorist attacks.

6,Comey hearing: FBI chief questioned on Russia,"(CNN) FBI Director James Comey strongly defended Wednesday his decision to alert Congress just days before the 2016 election about his agency's investigation into emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's personal server, telling senators while the idea of impacting the election made him ""mildly nauseous,"" he would not change what he did.

""It was a hard choice, I still believe in retrospect the right choice,"" Comey told senators at a judiciary committee hearing on oversight of his agency . ""I can't consider for a second whose political fortunes will be affected.""

Comey faced sharp questions from both sides of the aisle and is testifying the day after both the sitting US President and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee sharply criticized him for his role in the outcome of last year's presidential election.

He also said Russia to this day is actively involved in trying to influence US politics, emboldened after the outcome of last year's election.

""I think one of the lessons that the Russians may have drawn from this is: this works,"" Comey said.

Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley originally called the Wednesday oversight hearing of the FBI to examine what the agency knows about a 2015 terrorist attack in Garland, Texas . But the broad oversight hearing almost immediately shifted to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the US elections, a subject on which there are four congressional probes in progress that have led to a steady stream of revelations since President Donald Trump was elected.

Comey has become an almost equally divisive figure for Republicans and Democrats for his impact on the 2016 elections.

""A cloud of doubt hangs over the FBI's objectivity,"" Grassley said in his opening remarks, which listed a series of issues he took with the agency. The Iowa Republican added later, ""The public's faith in the FBI, Congress, and our democratic process has been tested lately.""

Comey cited the meeting on the tarmac between former President Bill Clinton and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch last year as a sign he was worried about leadership at the Justice Department's handling of its investigation.

""I'm not picking on the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who I like very much, but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me and I then said, you know what, the department cannot, by itself, credibly end this,"" Comey told the committee.

Comey's revelation that the FBI was examining additional emails from Hillary Clinton that were discovered on disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner's computer, has led Democrats -- including Clinton herself -- to say it cost them the White House.

""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off,"" the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said Tuesday in an interview conducted by CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the Women for Women International summit in New York.

Ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein used her first remarks to question the agency's timing and handling the Clinton investigation.

""Why didn't you just do the investigation as you would normally, with no public announcement?"" the California Democrat asked.

""Having repeatedly told this Congress we're done and there's nothing there, there's no case there, there's no case there, to restart in a hugely significant way, potentially finding the emails that would reflect on her intent from the beginning and not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view,"" Comey responded as part of his lengthy answer explaining his letter to Congress.

Most recently, CNN reported Tuesday that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is prepared to testify before a Senate panel next week that she gave a forceful warning to the White House regarding then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and his conversations with the Russians nearly three weeks before he was fired, contradicting the administration's version of events. Comey, responding to a question Wednesday from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, confirmed Yates discussed her assessment that Flynn may be vulnerable with him.

Following those remarks, Trump criticized Comey the night before the hearing.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony......Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?"" Trump said in a pair of tweets Tuesday.

Senate Democrats grilled the FBI chief about his decisions in the final days of the US election last year and his timing for releasing that information.

""The most important investigation the FBI is currently conducting is into Russia's interference in our last presidential election,"" Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, told CNN Tuesday. ""This isn't just about understanding Russian interference and potential coordination of some kind with the Trump campaign. This is about defending our next election as well.""

Meanwhile, Graham, who is leading his own investigation into Russia's interference in the election, said he still wants Comey to answer whether the FBI issued any warrants against the Trump campaign -- a question he asked months ago.

""I just want an answer. I just want to know what is going on here,"" Graham said Tuesday. ""You had (former Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper say there was no surveillance of the Trump campaign or Trump Tower. You've got press reports a FISA warrant was issued for Carter Page because of his ties to Russia. I just want to know what happened. And if we can't do it in an open session, let's do it in a closed session.""",cnn
6,Senator: FBI Director Comey 'as popular as cholera',"(CNN) In his typical colorful language, Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy described FBI Director James Comey's social standing in Washington as ""about as popular as cholera.""

""It's no secret Comey doesn't get invited to many parties on Capitol Hill,"" the Republican senator said on CNN's ""New Day"" Thursday morning, a day after Comey testified on Capitol Hill about his agency's probe into alleged links between the Trump campaign and the Russians. ""He's about as popular as cholera. I respect that about him. The impression I get of Comey is he's going to do his job and he doesn't care who gets mad at him.""

Comey is set to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday for a second round of testimony, this time behind closed doors -- after weeks of wrangling that almost knocked the House Russia investigation off-track.

""I appreciated Comey's candor,"" said Kennedy. ""He was forthcoming. He wasn't apologetic.""

Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers will brief the panel Thursday in a closed hearing that both Republicans and Democrats hope will result in more answers.

The tweets come after Clinton blamed her flawed candidacy, Russia's intervention in the election via WikiLeaks and a letter released by FBI Director James Comey for her 2016 election loss during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event in New York.

Comey will appear before a Senate committee Wednesday, where he'll face questions on Russian interference in the US election and why he decided to announce that the FBI was looking again at Clinton's emails just days before the election.

Hours before Trump tweeted, Clinton welcomed the President's ire after Amanpour predicted that the Twitter-focused President would respond to his former opponent.

3,Moon Jae-in: South Korean liberal claims presidency win,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Korea under Mr Moon is likely to overhaul its policy towards the North

Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in has claimed victory in South Korea's presidential election.

Mr Moon favours greater dialogue with North Korea, in a change to current South Korean policy.

""I will be president for all South Koreans,"" he told cheering supporters in Gwanghwamun Square in the capital Seoul.

The early election was called after a corruption scandal led to the impeachment of the former president.

Official results have yet to be released.

An exit poll conducted jointly by three network TV stations had put him on course to get 41.4% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, conservative Hong Joon-Pyo, on 23.3%.

Park Geun-hye is accused of allowing a close friend to extort money from companies. She denies all wrongdoing.

Mr Moon is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.

Change is coming: analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Seoul

A Moon Jae-in presidency would represent a real shift in attitude towards North Korea. His policy is to increase contact with North Korea, in contrast to the tighter sanctions of the last ten years. He is unhappy about the deployment of a US anti-missile system on South Korean soil.

When Mr Moon was last in government, in the early 2000s, South Korea had a ""Sunshine Policy"" which meant co-operation with North Korea, a policy which was abandoned as North Korea tested nuclear weapons.

As policy in South Korea looks like shifting, many sceptics remain who think that no amount of talking to Kim Jong-un will persuade him to renounce either his despotic power or his nuclear ambitions.

For the last eight years, Seoul and Washington have been in lock-step over North Korea, with ever tighter sanctions and isolation. That is not Mr Moon's way. Is it Donald Trump's?

Who is Moon?

The son of refugees from North Korea, Mr Moon was jailed while a student in the 1970s for leading protests against military ruler Park Chung-hee - Ms Park's father.

Later, he served in South Korea's special forces before becoming a human rights lawyer.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Moon, pictured with his wife, has been there at key points in South Korea's history

He served as a senior aide to liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, who committed suicide in 2009 after leaving office amid bribery allegations.

Mr Moon, of the centre-left Democratic Party, unsuccessfully ran against Ms Park in 2012 elections.

He has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandals of Ms Park's era.

""I feel that not only my party and myself but also the people have been more desperate for a change of government,"" he said while casting his vote.

What are his policies?

Mr Moon has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions, in contrast to Ms Park who cut almost all ties.

He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

But while tensions on the Korean peninsula ensured the election was closely watched, for South Koreans the priority has been corruption and the economy, with youth unemployment stubbornly high.

Mr Moon has talked of reforming South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, which dominate the domestic economy.",bbc-news

9,'I feel lost. I feel like a child': The complicated decline of Nick Buoniconti | FOX Sports,"A legend, searching for answers When former Dolphins Nick Buoniconti started falling, he knew something was wrong. What he and his family didn’t know was that they’d take a winding path to figuring out what.

This story appears in the May 15, 2017, issue of Sports Illustrated. To subscribe, go here.

They owned the lobby back then. Heads always turned. Men tried not to stare. Kids edged close. The women smiled wider, spoke a bit louder, and maybe their interest was innocent but they sure took the story back home with them, the one about—You won’t believe!—the big name they saw checking into the hotel.

Because in their prime they weren’t like the rest of us. They were larger, better looking—or maybe they just seemed that way because, come September, you saw their faces popping off the TV and in shiny magazines and newspapers. They were pro football players, weekend gods, loud and sure that they owned every room.

That feeling never fully dies. “Teddy!” Nick Buoniconti yells across the lobby of The Inn at Spanish Bay, near Pebble Beach.

It is a November Sunday in 2016, past twilight. The Hall of Fame linebacker, 75 but only slightly bent, is sitting with his wife, Lynn, at a polished table. The fresh faces behind the front desk don’t know Buoniconti; it has been 44 years since he co-captained the Dolphins to three straight Super Bowl seasons, including the league’s only perfect campaign, 17-0 in 1972. He’s not alone: Nearly two dozen greats from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s are here, wandering through the lobby toward the Grand Ballroom for the 26th annual Legends Invitational dinner. The oldest pass through mostly unnoticed.

But not by everyone. Not by anyone who grew up in the time when we knew little of players besides their names. Starr. Staubach. Tatum. Franco. Say just those words and an entire graying generation will transport back to the primordial highlight show, This Week in Pro Football, all operatic slo-mos and mythic narration.

In the next few hours a roster of venerables—Paul Warfield, Jan Stenerud, Jim Hart—will each utter a small shock at being remembered at all. This will at first seem odd, but it makes sense once they speak of how they missed out on free agency, or spent years fighting the league for better pensions, or are scrambling now to hack through the thicket of the NFL’s $1 billion concussion lawsuit settlement.

“Teddy!” Buoniconti yells again, and over comes Ted Hendricks, 69, along with his longtime partner, Linda Babl. Hendricks, the 6’7” linebacker dubbed “the Mad Stork” and “Kick ’Em in the Head Ted” for his loopy intensity on and off the field, played 15 years in the NFL, partied epically and never missed a game. Nick and Lynn stand.

“How are you doing, Teddy?” Lynn asks.

“Good,” says Ted, grinning. At that, Buoniconti unleashes a deep sigh, one so operatic that at first it seems involuntary; but later, after spending hours with him, one comes to know it as his fallback signal of dismay and, quite often, a looming explosion. Linda’s head pivots.

“How’ve you been?” she says.

Buoniconti doesn’t explain that he can’t figure out how to knot a tie or towel his back. He doesn’t speak of his increasingly useless left hand, the increasingly frequent trips to the emergency room or how, just a few days earlier at his home on Long Island, he hurtled backward down a staircase and sprayed blood all over the hardwood, screaming afterward at Lynn, “I should just kill myself! It doesn’t matter!” He doesn’t mention the three staples subsequently crimped into his scalp, doesn’t explain that just yesterday—in a fit of unexplainable pique, and against his own doctor’s orders—he had another physician come to his hotel room and yank those staples out.

“You know,” Buoniconti says.

And he’s right. Like most everyone who’s close to a former NFL player, Linda is living some variation of the same story. They’ve all seen the big-budget concussion movie and the news clips; they’ve read about the deaths of Junior Seau and Dave Duerson; they’re comparing notes on Facebook about the damage caused by repeated head trauma. They study their men. They accompany them to brain studies and name-drop superstar CTE researchers like Julian Bailes, Bennet Omalu, Robert Cantu, Ann McKee.

“We went to see Dr. Bailes last month, because he’s in Chicago now,” Linda says. “He’s really impressive, as far as one-to-one. Ted’s been in his study in North Carolina, the neuro-feedback . . . .”

Buoniconti releases another sigh.

It’s so random. Hendricks has only minor memory lapses. Some of Buoniconti’s Dolphins teammates, meanwhile, are crumbling. Quarterback Earl Morrall, the supersub so key to the Perfect Season, died at 79, in 2014, with Stage 4 CTE. Running back Jim Kiick, 70, lived in squalor until he was placed in an assisted living facility last summer with dementia/early onset Alzheimer’s. Bill Stanfill, a defensive end who long suffered from dementia, died in November at 69. His brain and spine were sent to the CTE center at Boston University, where the disease has been found in 96% of players’ brains studied. (Granted, that’s 96% of a group whose medical or playing history already suggests some sort of brain disease.)

“Everybody’s searching,” Buoniconti says in an aside, dropping his voice. “Some go to North Carolina, some to BU, some to UCLA. And it’s all related. That’s why it’s so unnecessary, what the NFL is putting the players through by making us document the neurological deficiencies. Not everybody can afford to go through that. And they say they’ll pay for it—but do you know what that’s like, actually getting the money?”

Ted and Linda leave for the ballroom. Nick and Lynn sit. Hall of Fame Vikings defensive end Chris Doleman stops by. He talks about how even the most familiar routines have become confounding, how he wakes up in his own bed wondering, Am I in a hotel? “And I’m 55,” he says. “I don’t know what I’ll be like at 59 or 65.”

“At 55 I was very normal,” Buoniconti says. “I’m not normal anymore.”

This is hard, at times, to believe. Everyone tells Nick he looks “great.” Indeed, he’ll soon get up before a packed ballroom and emcee the night’s program, tick off the names of every co-host, sponsor and speaker, tell war stories. He’ll even fire off a snappy rejoinder to a heckler in the crowd.

But few saw Buoniconti teeter as he walked off the stage, perhaps because of the atrophy to his right frontal cortex seen in 2015. Fewer noticed Nick motioning for Lynn as he bolted from the ballroom, perhaps because of the neurodegenerative dementia diagnosis just a month ago—or the yet-unspoken opinion that his condition could actually be corticobasal syndrome, complicated by an atypical Parkinsonian Syndrome or CTE or Alzheimer’s. He had to pee. And Lynn had to stand by to unbutton and unzip him and ensure that he’d emerge from the men’s room dry and unexposed.

And no one here saw him before all that, when Buoniconti stood up in the hotel lobby and headed toward the ballroom. “I feel lost,” he said. “I feel like a child.”

It’s forever easy to think that Miami’s top industry, after tourism, boils down to the cliché of political chicanery, petty vanities and believe-it-or-not news stories (“Florida Man Arrested with Alligator in His Backpack”) that continue to make Carl Hiaasen and Dave Barry very rich. Few fly into MIA expecting gravitas. Yet, of course, serious work goes on here. After a helmet-first tackle in 1985 made a quadriplegic of Buoniconti’s son Marc, a linebacker at The Citadel, Nick teamed up with University of Miami neurosurgeon Barth Green to co-found the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, leveraging every angle of Buoniconti’s celebrity to raise $2 million in year one. By 1990 the Project was well on its way to becoming the world’s largest center for spinal cord-injury and paralysis research, one of South Florida’s few civic anchors.

Much of that was due to Nick’s irresistible backstory. The Dolphins’ 1972 and ’73 championships command unique reverence as the fractured region’s first pro sports title winners. And Marc’s paralysis, widely covered in the media, lent Nick’s fame horrific depth; he became an unwilling model for life after the cheering stops and was accorded universal respect, even awe, for enduring what seemed an unending penance.

For though Marc became the Miami Project’s face, it was Nick who provided the indefatigable fuel for a money engine—the Buoniconti Fund—that has now raised more than $450 million, pays the salaries of 300 scientists and staff, and provides hope and comfort to thousands. Year after year, it was always Nick recruiting doctors, cajoling athletes to attend the Project’s annual New York City gala, making call after call on a mission that, on a personal level at least, seemed doomed.

“I would trade this [Super Bowl] ring in, and all my individual accomplishments, if one thing could happen in my lifetime,” Nick said to conclude his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech, in 2001. “My son Marc dreams that he walks. And as a father, I would like nothing more than to walk by his side.”

The ironic tragedy—that the very game which made Nick’s name also destroyed his son—became South Florida lore: How his first wife, Terry (Marc’s mother), pleaded with Marc’s older brother, Nick III, to cut short his career at Duke rather than risk facing another devastating blow. How, consumed by guilt, Nick once threatened to wrench off his Perfect Season ring and never wear it again. When Terry divorced Nick in 1997 after 35 years together, the news went notably uncovered; no one, it seemed, had the stomach for what seemed the last casualty of Marc’s collision, even if Nick didn’t publicly indulge any narrative connecting the events or guilt. “I never blamed myself,” Buoniconti told me when we first met in 2009, ring still on his hand. “I never blamed football.”

No, Nick saw Marc’s fate as a lightning-bolt rarity, a freak event compounded by The Citadel’s allegedly negligent medical staff. (A jury dismissed the Buoniconti’s $22.5 million lawsuit against a team doctor in 1988; the school and trainer settled with the family for $800,000.) Conceding the irony of his family’s relationship with the game is one thing—“Our greatest joy and greatest sadness, right”—but condemning football as inherently destructive was always something else. Wasn’t he himself proof otherwise?

Few longtime players—much less linebackers—emerged from the NFL fray more spectacularly intact. After retirement in 1976 Buoniconti went on to hit a pinnacle in three more careers: attorney and agent for 30 pro athletes; millionaire president of U.S. Tobacco; co-host for 23 years on HBO’s Inside the NFL. In 2009, when I met him to write a Sports Illustrated piece on Marc, Nick was humming along with No. 4, the Miami Project. He was 68, looked 15 years younger, played golf daily; he and Lynn lived in a $1.98 million home in Coral Gables. He sat on the terrace of his nearby country club, dynamic and bluntly eloquent. People kept stopping to say hello.

The family liked the story, but I didn’t speak to Nick again. Then, last October, he left a phone message. Nick, his words slightly halting, asked me to call him back and recited his number. “Okay,” he said. “Goodbye.”

Then came a long pause. You could hear him turn away from the phone. Finally Buoniconti asked, “How do you hang up, Lynn?”

Her voice, quavering, rose in disbelief. “ ‘How do you hang up?’ ” Lynn called from the background.

“Yeah.”

Then the line went dead.

Was there ever a more American life? Was there ever more reason for a man to be happy? Nick Buoniconti, born in 1940 the grandson of Italian immigrants, was raised in the south end of Springfield, Mass., by loving parents, surrounded by countless relatives, enveloped in the scent of fresh-baked bread. He came of age in a U.S. rising to world dominance and lived out its favorite narrative: Forever underestimated, time and again he proved all doubters wrong.

But Buoniconti wasn’t light of heart. Even at his warmest he possessed a hard, judgmental eye, wary of depending on anyone. Maybe that came from being a baker’s boy, ambitious in a home with no money for college. Or maybe it went deeper; his mother, Patsy, was a Mercolino, the Neapolitan family line streaked with a dark certitude: Life is out to get you. And wasn’t it? Nick nearly drowned at two, fell out of a moving car at three and survived scarlet fever at eight. At 12, when the school year ended, he went into the tobacco fields, weeding, picking, suckering and stringing leaves in draining heat for $6 a day.

Sure, for a six-year altar boy, the pride of the nuns at Cathedral High, Buoniconti’s ascension to play football at Notre Dame in 1958 seemed the apex of Catholic dreams. But disillusion came fast. An all-state outfielder, Nick loved baseball like his dad, Big Nick, who’d pitched semi-pro ball all over New England. Notre Dame, beacon of virtue, lured young Nick with the promise that—Sure, son—he could play baseball, too. But upon arrival, Buoniconti found that he was there for football, period. “Notre Dame lied to me,” he says.

No wonder that, compared to headhunting peers like Dick Butkus, Buoniconti always came off as strictly business. When Dolphins coach Don Shula learned, decades later, of Buoniconti’s childhood nickname, he nearly choked. “You mean to tell me,” he said, “that I coached a mean son of a bitch named Skippy?!’”

Tough, mulish—any variant will do. Buoniconti was the only player to survive telling Shula, in front of the team, to “shut the f--- up.” Shula bristled, but he respected it: Buoniconti was rushing to a teammate’s defense. He didn’t do anything for effect. He couldn’t afford to. This was an All-America who, after Notre Dame coach Joe Kuharich dubbed him too small to play pro ball—“He’ll run through a brick wall for you,” Kuharich quipped, “but he’ll leave a small hole”—had been humiliatingly ignored by the NFL and passed over in the first 12 rounds of the upstart AFL’s draft.

Buoniconti, at 215 pounds, played guard and linebacker during one of Notre Dame’s worst eras and seemed a Fighting Irish epitome—pious, macho, consumed by football. But he wasn’t. Irked freshman year by his boring quarterback roommate, Buoniconti kicked him out and moved in with newfound pal Richie Catenacci, a 5'4"" civilian. Told by the Dean of Men, a priest, that he was breaking Notre Dame’s long tradition of housing athletes together, Nick dug in. “The rule is stupid,” he said.

The two young men roomed together for four years, had the usual alcohol-fueled escapades, became best friends. Buoniconti convinced his roommate there was nothing unmanly about singing in the glee club, and it changed Catenacci’s life. Richie insisted that Nick improve a weak vocabulary, so they created a “word of the day” to learn and use. “He wanted to be educated, well-spoken,” Catenacci says.

Yet Buoniconti also played each snap with life-or-death fervor. He led the Irish with 74 tackles his senior year and then, minutes into his first day of Boston Patriots camp, in 1962, brawled with veteran tight end—and ordained Baptist minister—Tony Romeo, who Nick says infringed on “my territory, my land.” It wasn’t a matter of manhood. Buoniconti held no romantic notions about the game. Football was a vehicle, a means, and championships made it move faster. That year he married his high school sweetheart, Terry Salamano, a nurse. He wanted to be rich.

“He worked so hard,” Terry says, “but I always felt it was to better our lives, our children’s lives. The naiveté: We went to somebody’s house and they had all this shrimp in a bowl and we were like, ‘Look at all that shrimp!’ We didn’t even know what caviar was. It was beautiful. I felt that we grew together.”

Opponents, meanwhile, sniffed at Buoniconti’s size, compared him to a fire hydrant, even if he did lead the Patriots in tackles and interceptions over his seven seasons. Nick didn’t care. “When Butkus hits you, you fall the way he wants,” he said. “When I hit you, you fall the way you want. But you still fall.”

Such satisfactions went only so far. The $15,000 he earned as a rookie was never going to be enough. In 1963, Terry had Gina, the first of three quick babies, and Nick enrolled at Boston’s Suffolk Law School, racing to courses at night, briefing cases on road trips, studying while teammates partied. He finished in four years. “I didn’t particularly care for football,” he says. “I was tired of it.”

Buoniconti didn’t know it then, but such is the secret of all good negotiators: He could walk away. He had just signed a lease to open a law office in Chestnut Hill when the Patriots traded him to the hapless Dolphins before the 1969 season. Miami owner Joe Robbie was a famous skinflint; Nick, acting as his own agent, demanded double his pay, guaranteed. “We don’t give guaranteed contracts,” Robbie said.

Buoniconti sent his retirement papers to the NFL. Robbie tried holding firm, but—even with the law practice stalled and his only alternative a $10,000 job at the U.S. attorney’s office—Nick wouldn’t budge. “It really didn’t matter to me if I retired,” Buoniconti says. “I didn’t care.”

Robbie folded. Buoniconti was named the Dolphins’ MVP his first season and, after Shula took over, again when they improved from three to 10 wins in 1970. In ’71, with Buoniconti the hub of coordinator Bill Arnsparger’s ever-stunting defenses, the Dolphins surrendered just 12.4 points a game and blanked the defending champ Colts in the AFC championship. By then the assault on Buoniconti’s body and brain was well underway. He says he was knocked unconscious four or five times over his 14-year career, the worst during the Cowboys’ 24–3 rout of Miami in Super Bowl VI that January. Buoniconti smashed into a player in the third quarter and blacked out—but stayed on his feet and on the field until game’s end. “I was gone,” he says. “That was the worst one. I don’t remember playing.”

The subsequent Perfect Season in ’72—the undefeated, untied campaign culminating in a 14–7 win over Washington in Super Bowl VI—remains the team’s monument, but in ’73, on the way to another Super Bowl title, the Dolphins allowed even fewer points, just five touchdown passes all season, and Buoniconti set a team record with 162 tackles.

Buoniconti has estimated that he absorbed 520,000 hits to the head. “My last game, I got on my hands and knees and kissed the ground and thanked God that I’d never gotten seriously hurt.”

Of those, 91 came unassisted, and over time it would become clear which flank he favored. Buoniconti’s right wrist, knee and ankle would become arthritic; his right hip would need to be replaced; range of motion in his right shoulder was limited. Buoniconti has publicly estimated that over his 14-year pro career (not to mention 13 more years in boyhood, high school and college football) he has absorbed some 520,000 hits to the head. That MRIs in 2015 and ’16 would reveal brain shrinkage—surfacing first in the right frontal and temporal regions—seemed almost logical.

At the time Buoniconti noticed none of it. A broken right thumb forced him to miss the 1975 season, and he gladly began working as a CBS analyst. A spate of injuries prompted the Dolphins to ask him back in ’76, twice; Buoniconti demanded $125,000 and got it. He started just four games that season, then said goodbye for good. He was 36, certain he’d gotten out clean.

“My last game, at the end I got on my hands and knees and kissed the ground and thanked God that I’d never gotten seriously hurt,” Buoniconti says. “Fourteen-year career? I could’ve been maimed.”

Instead, he looked great. Wavy hair just starting to gray, hawkish nose: From the neck up Nick looked like Michelangelo’s David, done slinging rocks and ready to be anointed king. He radiated authority, though that on-field ferocity needed softening, first in the courtroom, and later as the agent for Yankees shortstop Bucky Dent, Expos outfielder Andre Dawson and others.

Loaded with leverage after Dent’s epic playoff home run over the Red Sox in 1978, Buoniconti nearly laughed when New York owner George Steinbrenner threatened to trade Dent the following winter. “Go ahead!” Buoniconti told him over lunch. “There’ll be a lot of takers.”

Steinbrenner stonewalled through the 1979 season, and Dent walked out of Yankee Stadium after the final game certain his time in the Bronx was over. Buoniconti, unfazed, mused to reporters about the team’s hardships, told the Yankees’ GM that Dent was signing with the Angels and booked their flight to L.A. Steinbrenner signed Dent to a five-year extension. “Good luck with your prenup, honey,” Steinbrenner later told Lynn, when Nick introduced her as his fiancée at a New York benefit. “That’s the meanest guy I ever negotiated with.”

Because he could walk away—from just about anyone. Buoniconti loved corporate work, pushing paper, because, he says, “I didn’t have to deal with clients.” In 1980 he landed Dawson’s first $1 million-a-year salary; four years later, after Dawson hadn’t heard from Buoniconti for 14 months, Dawson fired him. “When I got traded, I didn’t hear from him, either,” Dent says of his midseason departure from the Yankees in ’82. “I was like, What’s going on here? Nick wasn’t one of those warm-and-fuzzy guys . . . but he did a good job for me.”

To be fair, Buoniconti’s plate was piled high. People kept tapping him for leadership, for connections to his old buddies from his days in Boston and the AFL, guys like congressmen Jack Kemp and Tip O’Neill. In 1982 the Dade County Democratic party named Nick chairman; he quickly organized a $250-a-plate dinner, induced the governor to come, and raised $80,000. Meanwhile, his long association with U.S. Tobacco, the nation’s largest purveyor of smokeless products, like Skoal and Copenhagen, was beginning to pay off.

UST’s president, Louis Bantle, first asked Buoniconti and some other Dolphins to mingle at a client cocktail party in the early 1970s. Then he hired Nick for legal work. In ’83 Nick was named executive VP in charge of legal and federal affairs and public relations. Sales had spiked fivefold over the previous decade, but clouds loomed; the business was becoming viewed as a health menace. In ’88, the U.S. surgeon general declared nicotine goods such as chewing tobacco to be as addictive as heroin.

But even as Buoniconti lobbied over the years for the tobacco industry, his image as an athlete—and a perfect one, at that—prevailed. Indeed, he proved so valuable a spokesman that in ’85, Bantle made him UST’s president and COO. The one-time tobacco picker—who had never smoked or dipped himself—became the industry’s most famous, and ardent, defender.

In one typical interview that fall, with the Chicago Tribune, Buoniconti railed against “anti-tobacco forces” and touted scientists who, he said, maintained “there’s absolutely nothing wrong with your product.” He went on: “We’ll survive. We were the first packaged-good product in the United States. We helped fund the Revolutionary War!”

It wasn’t the last time Buoniconti’s mind, shrewd and curious, would dodge a discomfiting truth. He’s not incapable of irony—“I thought 1985 would be a great year because 85 was my jersey number and so great to me, and actually it was the worst year of my life”—but Buoniconti sprang out of an era when guilt didn’t travel over generations. He liked to believe that the world came at a man head on, laid out choices and left him free to choose. Use tobacco or don’t. Play football or don’t.

It’s not in Buoniconti to admit the sheer weirdness of the fact that in ’85 he became a human fulcrum—at once seller and sufferer, perpetrator and victim—of public health crises involving two titanic American pastimes. “I’m not getting into that, O.K.?” he yells. “One has nothing to do with the other!”

A day after Marc’s injury, Terry found her husband sitting on the floor outside intensive care, tears streaming, saying, “God is punishing me, God is punishing me.”

The first blow came in the summer when Big Nick, a lifetime smoker, died at 75 of lung cancer, just as his son was taking over UST. Of his four-year stint on top of the company, Buoniconti says, “I loved it. I loved being in charge; it was like being a middle linebacker and calling the defenses.” Asked if he ever felt conflicted, considering tobacco’s now-confirmed harmful effects, he says, “Yeah, we were under fire a lot, mostly taxes. But in my mind, we never marketed it to kids. It was a good job. I enjoyed it.”

The second blow came 12 days after he invoked the American Revolution in the Tribune. Nick and Terry were at the New Jersey spread of his old roomie, Richie Catenacci. It was a perfect Saturday, the kind where you can’t help but think, Yes, we made it: 72 degrees, sitting in the gazebo, sipping champagne. Nick asked Catenacci’s nephew to check the football scores; both games featuring his linebacker sons—Marc at The Citadel, Nick III at Duke—had been going for an hour. The phone rang.

It was Bantle. Marc had been hurt; no one knew how bad. Bantle gave Nick a number to call. He dialed thinking, Shoulder, maybe a knee. . . . A doctor answered. His first words were, “Mr. Buoniconti, your son dislocated his neck and he’s going to be paralyzed for the rest of his life.”

Nick fell to his knees. Richie reached down to grab him but, for the first time in their 27-year friendship, Nick looked lost. “How am I going to tell his mother?” he begged. But he did it; he went outside and blasted a hole in Terry’s world. She’ll never forget that day, how beautiful it was, Nick’s face coming closer, his mouth saying that Marc would never walk again. She’ll never forget, too, how a day later, outside of intensive care, she found her husband sitting on the floor, tears streaming, saying, “God is punishing me, God is punishing me.”

And right then, amid a mother’s worst nightmare and a scuttling fear, Terry had this one moment of clarity. She leaned over to her husband. “God doesn’t work that way,” she said.

Before she became Nick’s wife, in 2000, Lynn could well imagine the black-hole enormity that paralysis becomes to anyone within its orbit. But it still took years of fundraisers and medical crises for her to realize this: “I say that Nick is married to Marc, because the No. 1 priority in Nick Buoniconti’s life is Marc Buoniconti,” Lynn says.

But she didn’t understand that fully until 2008, when Justin, her then-21-year-old son by her first marriage, was assaulted outside a Cambridge, Mass., bar and nearly died of a traumatic brain injury. “I know now: It’s as if Nick carries Marc’s weight on his shoulders,” Lynn says. “You move heaven and earth to help your child, especially when they go through a life-or-death experience.”

Once Marc was stabilized and placed into Barth Green’s care in October 1985, Nick moved fast. He landed a $100,000 pledge from UST immediately and within a month organized a fundraiser at a Dolphins game that raised another $300,000. The Miami Project was underway. “Nick is extraordinary,” Green says. “I’ve taken care of thousands of patients with brain and spinal cord injuries and paralysis, but I’ve never had a person stay so committed so long. Everybody’s gung-ho for a year or two, then they disappear. Nick has raised several hundred million dollars, and I attribute almost all of it to his charisma, his national presence, his intelligence and ability to articulate the importance of curing paralysis.”

Some believe the accident changed Nick. How could it not? Before, he was ensconced at UST headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., hardly a presence as Marc smoked pot, vandalized cars and homes, and bombed grades at South Miami’s Columbus High. Before, he’d see someone in a wheelchair, think Too bad, and keep walking. Marc’s paralysis humbled Nick, grounded him in a way that fame and fortune never could. His focus shifted south, to Miami and Marc and the Project and home.

“To the degree that he got fired from UST,” Green says. “The CEO said, ‘Look, we need a full-time president. You’ve got to give this your all. Otherwise . . . .’ And that’s when Nick left.”

The fact that UST health insurance, as part of his separation agreement, would continue to cover most of Marc’s estimated $500,000 in annual expenses made the move easier. And hustling for the Miami Project filled the void of attention and purpose felt by many retired athletes. But Nick also found himself more tolerant. A squeamish Nick held Marc during each of Marc’s ensuing health scares. In 2014, when a near-fatal respiratory infection had his son saying, for the first time, “Just let it end,” Nick spent eight hours a day, for six weeks, by Marc’s side.

“Every day in the hospital—and he hates a hospital—he sat there with me,” Marc says. Then, after a deep breath, his eyes widen and he adds, “And with my mom!”

Such emphasis assumes a knowledge of how tough that might be. After all, his parents’ spiky relationship was hardly a secret in Miami after their bitter split in 1997—and basic chronology made it easy to figure. In the fall of ’95 the 54-year-old Nick met Lynn Weiss at Dakota, a bar on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Monday Night Football was on the TV, she was 12 years his junior and vivacious, the owner of a successful travel business. “The smartest person I’ve ever met,” Nick says. He was entranced; Lynn wasn’t. But soon they were an item.

Nick and Terry, together since Cathedral High, were still married. She was furious when she found out about Lynn. At least once Buoniconti wondered, to Catenacci, why they couldn’t carry on: Growing up, a mistress—a goumad—wasn’t unheard of in some Italian households.

“There’s a side of Nick that wants to have it all and a side that recognizes you can’t,” says Catenacci. “I said, ‘The world has changed and you can’t have a wife and a goumad anymore. That’s original sin, and you know Terry’s not going to put up with that. You know the right thing—do it.’ And he did.”

That may sound like the morality of a man cornered, but Buoniconti resists glib pigeonholing. A former Democratic leader once horrified by cannabis, he supports Donald Trump and now entertains the idea of using medical marijuana. Appalled by the racist welcome doled out to black players upon their arrival for the 1965 AFL All-Star Game in New Orleans, Buoniconti joined—and fully backed—a boycott that forced the game’s move to Houston.

After decades of dating women, in the early 1990s Catenacci fell in love with a man, but he didn’t tell Nick. Years passed. Finally, on an Aspen ski lift, Buoniconti confronted his old roommate. “So when are you going to tell me?”

“What do you want to know?” Catenacci asked.

“Does he love you? Because you know I love you, and I would never want anybody to hurt you.”

Lynn’s first real scare came with Nick behind the wheel. This was in 2013. During a drive in Fort Lauderdale, all the stimuli absorbed without thinking—lights, pedestrians, directions, chitchat, radio—came confusingly alive for Nick. A simple turn across oncoming traffic became a mess, and his car jumped a curb. But he was also 72, had been forgetting things: a phone number here, a social commitment there. Lynn chalked it up to age. Then he started falling. Yet even to his doctors, it was hard to see anything out of the ordinary.

His falling had become commonplace—taking out the garbage, walking the dog. With each spill, Nick got angrier, resenting his body—the instrument that gave him everything—for betraying him.

Because unlike Mike Webster or Duerson or Seau, who suffered dramatic depression in their 30s and 40s and were dead at 50, Buoniconti’s brain trouble only surfaced in his early 70s, when even non-football playing brains present signs of shrinkage and decay. And even then, he was still speaking and flying and golfing; a February 2014 MRI at the University of Miami attributed the “mild asymmetric volume loss” in Nick’s right anterior temporal lobe—and his balance and memory issues—as “compatible with age-appropriate involutional changes.”

But then food became an obsession. Dinner out with friends would start off well—wine flowing, fun couple—then they’d notice Nick hadn’t spoken for a bit. Ordering took on urgency. He spent long minutes staring down at his plate. Lynn tried alerting his children, Gina and Nick III and Marc, but they didn’t see Nick daily. And besides, he’d always been a handful. That’s just Dad: Intense, likes to be waited on . . . .

His handwriting slowed, and became spidery. On a freezing day he came home distressed from the gym; he couldn’t figure out how to put on his coat. By then his falling had become commonplace—taking out the garbage, walking the dog, standing up from a chair. He’d drop like a sack of cement, face-first, and bleed plenty but feel no pain; by the end of 2014 he was averaging nearly one serious spill a month. And with each fall he got angrier, resenting his body—the instrument that gave him everything—for betraying him.

Doctors at the University of Miami seemed less alarmed, recommending close observation. A December 2014 exam noted that Buoniconti “does seem to be altered in his mental status,” but attributed that to, among other things, a recent fever. Lynn felt otherwise. In January ’15 she arranged a summit meeting at the Miami Project offices attended by Barth Green; scientific director Dalton Dietrich; Nick’s personal physician, Eugene Sayfie; Lynn; Nick and Gina. Marc attended via conference call.

* * *

Lynn, Nick and Gina recall that the medical staff in the meeting seemed settled on the idea that Buoniconti’s balance and mental issues were typical markers of aging, probably compounded by his football history. Green insists that he and the rest of the UM doctors were hardly that casual, that they told the family “that Nick had a post-traumatic syndrome,” Green says, “that some of the things that were happening to him were definitely related to his multiple head injuries, but he also had other stuff going on and it wasn’t classical for anything—for Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s.”

At one point Marc, by phone, speculated that, by harping on Nick’s difficulties, Lynn was creating a “self-fulfilling prophecy”—and only making matters worse. “I still don’t know what that means. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” Nick says. “If I didn’t have this issue, I wouldn’t be talking about it.”

A subsequent round of neuropsychological tests found that, though Buoniconti did not “meet criteria for dementia or mild cognitive impairment,” he had mild decrements; another brain MRI that same month, however, again revealed only “age-appropriate involutional changes.” But if the medical picture was foggy, other proof seemed clear. On April 13, 2015, an ambulance rushed Buoniconti to the ER after he gashed his nose and eye in another fall. A month later, Lynn filmed Nick’s tortuous, nearly two-minute process of figuring out how to put on a T-shirt and ball cap. And both were losing patience with Buoniconti’s longtime colleagues at the Miami Project.

“I felt let down, that they didn’t understand what I’m going through—or they didn’t seem interested in finding out what I’m going through,” Buoniconti says.

In fact, Green says, the UM team had long been concerned by Buoniconti’s “cascade of sequelae”—physical and mental symptoms—and suspected CTE and its precipitating brain-clogging protein, tau, as one possible cause. But “I think all of us were in denial,” Green says. “And then once we saw what was going on, we faced a dilemma : As Nick’s friends and family here at the Miami Project, are we going to tell him, ‘Nick, you’re going downhill, and you’ve got a disease’—when there’s really no treatment or any of the symptoms? Or should we say, ‘Nick, you look great and you’re doing well and I wouldn’t worry about this’?

The video Nick Buoniconti's family wants you to see For 14 years, Nick Buoniconti decimated offenses. Then, the erosion set in.

“So we decided, as a group, that we weren’t going to shove it down his throat unless we have something that could stop this cascade of neurological events and reverse it. As his symptoms grew, we tried to reinforce the positive—the fact he still was a kick-ass guy, he could get in front of these people and empty their pockets of millions of dollars to help research, and he could play in a golf tournament.

“Lynn was never ignored,” Green continues. “She loves Nick a lot, but in her zealousness to get help for him she’s constantly—publicly and in private—telling him that he’s going to hell. So: different philosophy. We didn’t think that was the way to go. And I still don’t think so. I don’t think it does any damn good to tell him, ‘Your whole brain is going to be full of tau. You’re dying and people aren’t caring about you, and you’re just going to keep getting worse and you need to be taken care of.’ What did that accomplish then, and what does it accomplish now? That’s not the way I fly, and it’s not because I’m stupid. It’s not because I don’t love him. It’s just a different strategy.”

At the same time, Green did recommend the testing regimen that led University of Miami doctors to a more specific diagnosis. In the spring of 2015, the head of UM’s Neuropsychology Department, Bonnie Levin, became the first to cite CTE as a possible cause of Buoniconti’s mental decline. Another UM neurologist, Carlos Singer, declared in a May ’15 summary that Buoniconti’s physical and mental symptoms were most compatible with senile dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, CTE and frontotemporal dementia.

A definitive CTE diagnosis is possible only by autopsy. But experimental testing (involving PET scans after the injection of radioactive dye that highlights the protein tau, which can be an indicator of the disease) has increasingly showed evidence of CTE in small samples of living patients. In November 2013, Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett—the most famous of a cadre of 14 NFL veterans who underwent that testing—revealed to ESPN that his exam at UCLA confirmed the presence of tau and other signs of CTE. A year and a half later, in May 2015, at Lynn’s suggestion, Singer agreed to refer Buoniconti for an experimental PET scan at the Feinstein Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., on Long Island.

But Nick was tired of the prodding. They flew to their Long Island home, and summer and fall passed there with him refusing to go. Lynn issued a winter ultimatum: Do the scans or I’m not going back to Miami. Now he knew how Robbie and Steinbrenner felt.

Though they did not measure specifically for tau, the two Feinstein scans indicated damage that went beyond “involutional”—consistent with Parkinsonian syndrome and CTE. The Feinstein neurologist, Andrew Feigin, confirmed to Nick that atrophy had set in on the right side of his brain and believed it was due to abnormal amounts of tau. He said the protein would soon spread to the left side, and that it could never be reversed.

“It was like a car accident,” Lynn says. “The point of impact.”

The couple stopped at a diner on the way home. Nick said “yeah” when she asked if he understood, and then they sat there crying.

* * *

It felt like a death sentence. There was no word, no possible treatment, offering any hope. And Buoniconti wasn’t a glass-half-full guy to begin with. Even when his life had seemed a testament to optimism, his disposition had folks calling him Negative Nick. Now, with neither work nor golf to distract him, Buoniconti’s lifelong terror of dying had room to run. The Mercolino darkness kicked in hard.

“We’re the players who built the game, but have been forgotten,” Nick says. “The settlement is a joke. They are waiting for us to die.”

“He’s frustrated and depressed,” Marc said in November. “He’s lost in his own physical disability and there’s no break from it. He’s sitting at his house; he has no outlets. He falls down, and that conversation only exacerbates it. That’s his life, man-—a vicious cycle.”

Marc calls it “heartbreaking” to watch his rock crumble, but he didn’t doubt the reason. For decades he had pushed back against those who cited his paralysis as Exhibit A in the case against the game, celebrating it as a vehicle for character building and teamwork. No more.

“If someone asked if their child should play organized contact football, I could not in good conscience recommend it,” Marc says. “I don’t think it’s safe. It’s pretty evident that something significant is happening to the brain as far as disrupted development over time. I cannot recommend football for, really, anybody. I was 50-50 on this already but, then, watching my dad—that sealed it for me.”

Though he knows this admission cements the Buonicontis as the first family of football tragedy, Marc won’t play the victim. Early predictions had him living 20 years, tops, as a quadriplegic, and he’s survived at least four near-death scares in the 31 years since. He calls his existence “gravy.” And in his 32nd year inside a lifeless body, something has changed; for the first time, father and son’s roles have reversed. Now Marc’s the one urging Nick to stop with the self-pity. There’s always someone worse off than you..

Says Marc: “I’ve told him, ‘You’ve got to get your s--- together. Look at me. My life sucks, but I make the best of it.’ And he’s like, ‘I know, I know.’ But it hasn’t changed his approach to life.”

Though he knows Lynn’s lot is thankless—“God bless her for taking care of him; my dad’s a pain in the ass”—Marc still wonders if her focus on Nick’s deficits makes them worse. Nick and Lynn scoff at this; it remains a touchy issue. But drained of family drama, Marc’s theory on positive reinforcement seems less a potshot than one more desperate response to an epidemic without cure. Everybody’s searching.

And the fact is, one reason Nick decided to make public his decline was to mine some good of it. No ailing ex-player, after all, has had more resources—a blue-ribbon health care plan, money for the travel and costs of experimental tests that insurance won’t cover, instant access to an innovative and grateful medical staff, a partner with patience enough to research studies and sift medical files and schedule appointments—with which to navigate his condition. Yet even he is a confused mess.

“So if I’m having this problem and Lynn is hovering over me making sure things get done, can you imagine someone in the same situation who can’t figure it out?” Nick asks. “I feel for these guys. They have no direction. It’s not fair that you make the league all this money, and they don’t care about you anymore. You think they care about a player who no longer can contribute to their financial success? Come on.”

The NFL, the Players Association and the Hall of Fame Players Foundation do have various outreach programs for former players; NFL Player Care, set up in 2007, has provided more than $12 million to 980 former players in financial need and contributed $6.6 million to medical research studies. (In late April Nick hired three medical aides for round-the-clock assistance, tapping into the NFL and NFLPA’s jointly-run 88 Plan, which provides up to $118,000 per year for in-home care.) In 2010 the NFL added a neurological care program to evaluate and treat “possible” conditions for vested retirees. But the outreach for all of the above has hardly been ideal, and the $1 billion concussion settlement has added a huge new layer of bureaucracy—and resentment.

Few of the estimated 20,000 players covered by the settlement would seem better equipped to understand its legal issues and jargon than Buoniconti. The older the former player, the less likely that diseases like Alzheimer’s, ALS or dementia can be attributed solely to football; CTE remains undiagnosable in the living. That means that virtually all those who played before 1993, when NFL free agency took effect, will again miss out on the big money. For example: Nick’s dementia diagnosis, combined with his age and 14-year career, make him eligible for a settlement of just $132,000.

He doesn’t need that money to finance his evaluations and travel costs and treatments, but others of his era do. “The NFL should be volunteering to pay for this,” Buoniconti screamed abruptly in a UCLA examination room last November. “I’m so f------ pissed off at them!

“We’re the players who built the game, but have been forgotten. The settlement is a joke; the way it was structured is a joke. They are waiting for us to die. They’re going to play the clock out until everybody dies.”

So Buoniconti has one last fight on his hands. It’s not simple, like his rookie scuffle with the Reverend Romeo. It’s not clear, like his mission to cure paralysis. No, this battle lies within, between warring impulses. There are days he wants to know exactly what’s wrong with his brain, if only because naming an enemy gives you a better chance of defeating it. And there are days when he doesn’t. What difference will it make? He’s not looking to end football. The game was his steel mill, his coal mine—a way up and out.

“I didn’t have any idea the price would be this debilitating,” Buoniconti says. “Had I known, would I have played? I had no alternative; there was no other way for me to get a college education. Football kept rewarding me—I can’t deny that. But I’m paying the price.” He shrugs, grins. “Everybody pays the piper.”

He’s hardly so resigned day to day. Buoniconti’s temper ignites over the smallest frustrations—a ringing phone, bed blankets, a hand proffered to help him stand. In January 2016 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and Lynn with breast cancer, and the treatment has been draining. Just before the family gathered for the annual Miami Project gala in New York City last September, Nick tumbled over a chair and gashed up his forehead and nose again.

“When you marry your best friend and now he’s not your best friend anymore because there’s someone else in there, it’s very difficult,” Lynn says. “He looks like the person I married. But he really isn’t there.”

In September 2016, Gina, Marc and Nick III urged their dad to hire a driver and live-in aide, and stick to his prescribed therapies, if for nothing else than to save his marriage. “She was ready to leave him,” Marc says. “I don’t blame her.”

“Had I known, would I have played?” Buoniconti says. “I had no alternative. Football kept rewarding me—I can’t deny that.”

The night Buoniconti was to emcee the gala in New York, an HBO makeup artist slathered pancake on the fresh gashes on his face. A New York Times videographer tried interviewing him, but his mind derailed 46 seconds in. “I’m not ready for this,” Nick said, wandering abruptly off camera. It took 20 minutes of sitting alone in the Waldorf ballroom before Lynn could calm him down. (Terry, who is remarried and goes months without seeing Nick, was there and struck by his vacant stare. “I thought, ‘Is he going to be able to even get through speaking?’” she says. “But he got up there and did great.”)

Still, it was to placate Lynn, as much as anything, that Buoniconti agreed to ride from Pebble Beach to Westwood last November for a preliminary workup at UCLA’s groundbreaking BrainSPORT Program. But that set off another roller coaster. First, a lift: Initial exams there seemed to rule out Alzheimer’s disease and CTE. Then, six weeks later, a drop: Buoniconti’s UCLA MRI revealed significant atrophy in his frontal lobes, and the resulting diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome was what Green had been wrestling with all along. Not only is CBS a catchall that could indicate Alzheimer’s and CTE, but it’s often paired with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), a disease with a sharply defined prognosis. With no treatment or cure, “we didn’t want to pin that diagnosis on Nick because he could Google it,” Green says, “and see that the average life expectancy is six or seven years.”

The UCLA team thus recommended a cerebrospinal tap and an experimental PET scan to test for Alzheimer’s-type amyloid and the tau prominent in CTE. Nick wanted nothing to do with either. For months Lynn pushed, and he dug in. She wanted confirmation of what they were facing; he wanted only reversal.

Then, in early February, the thinnest straw presented itself: One of Nick’s brothers emailed about a newspaper story in which Joe Namath controversially claimed marked brain improvement following 120 sessions of breathing pure oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber. Despite being claustrophobic, Nick lunged for it.

He called Namath, who described a complete cure. He called Green, who was skeptical. Four University of Miami doctors weighed in, calling the procedure—which is highly effective for wound care—“relatively safe” but utterly unproven to render long-term brain improvement. Nick didn’t care. He stopped physical therapy and insisted instead on going to UM Hospital for a 140-minute, five-day-a-week experimental course of inhaling pure oxygen at high pressure in what looks like a giant transparent tanning bed.

At first he came home exhausted but “mentally brighter,” says Magaly Rodriguez, the UM surgeon in charge of Nick’s hyperbaric course. “By the end of the first week I was very encouraged. He was lighter on his feet, more focused, sharper.”

But on March 11 Buoniconti fell again while walking his dog, cutting and bruising his head, hand and elbow and requiring five stitches in one leg. His temper flared again, and the dizzy spells hit; he began to dread going inside the chamber. All signs of progress faded. On the night of March 26 Rodriguez was at home. She watched the movie Concussion, again, and prayed for Nick Buoniconti.

“We have to find a way to stop the progression of this ailment,” she says. “I remember watching him as a child, growing up [in Miami]. It’s a labor of love.”

The next morning, Buoniconti phoned four times to say that he would meet me at the chamber at 10:30 a.m. “Did I already call you?” he said after the third. After having viewed his stagnant results and rising anxiety, Rodriguez decided that, after 25 sessions, it was time to hit pause. She recommended Buoniconti undergo a new round of cognitive tests. He was relieved, really, but still sighed: another dead end.

Waiting for Nick's car outside the hospital, the building that holds Buoniconti's monument—the Miami Project—loomed tall and white across the street. Later, at a nearby Starbucks, Lynn mulled a rushed retrofit of their bathroom, the mechanics of arranging 24-hour in-home care. Nick ate cheese and crackers and said his dizziness had passed. At one point he stood, one of the great names of a generation, and asked for help slipping his phone into his front-left pocket. The table went quiet, and he sat again.

“I really would like to know what the hell is going on,” Buoniconti said. Outside a breeze pushed the palms just enough so you could hear them. “But I’m going to deteriorate anyway, so do we go back to UCLA? I’m up in the air.”

6,Rep ends interview when pressed on IDs for town halls,"Story highlights Rod Blum represents a competitive district in eastern Iowa

He required attendees to ""verify residency"" at his Monday event by showing that they live in his district

Washington (CNN) An Iowa congressman abruptly ended an interview moments after it started when pressed why he was requiring town hall attendees to prove they are his constituents.

""This is ridiculous,"" said Rod Blum, an Iowa Republican as he removed the microphone attached to his shirt, stood up and exited the room. ""This is ridiculous.""

Blum, who represents a competitive district in eastern Iowa, was seated in a classroom surrounded by grade-school children as he spoke in Dubuque with KCRG reporter Josh Scheinblum. As town halls grow chaotic across the country due to divisions over whether to replace Obamacare, Blum required attendees to ""verify residency"" at his Monday event by showing that they live in his district, according to a town hall Eventbrite page.

""Some would make the case that you represent all Iowans. The decisions that you make impact all Iowans. So shouldn't all Iowans have a voice at the table?"" Scheinblum asked.

""I don't represent all Iowans,"" Blum said with a laugh. ""I represent the 1st District of Iowa. That'd be like saying: 'Shouldn't I be able to -- even though I live in Dubuque -- go vote in Iowa City during the election because I'd like to vote in that district instead?'""

Jeter, whose No. 2 will be retired and enshrined in Monument Park before Sunday’s game at Yankee Stadium, has just one regret. From the New York Post:

“I really haven’t [reflected on my career]. I really haven’t sat back and reflected. Someone asked me recently, do I have any regrets in my career? My last season, I kept a journal; every day I’d write something in there,’’ Jeter told YES Network in a sit-down interview with Jack Curry that aired after Monday’s game against the Reds.

“The one regret I do have is that I wish I would’ve done that my entire career, because there are so many things that you forget. Still to this day I haven’t looked at it. It’s locked up and I haven’t looked. I’m going to be a father soon, so I’m sure one day when I sit down with my kid — or kids, if there’s multiple — I’ll get a chance to reflect and maybe brag like my dad used to do when I was younger.”

3,Irish police drop Stephen Fry blasphemy probe,"Image copyright PA

Police in the Republic of Ireland are no longer investigating a claim that British comedian Stephen Fry uttered blasphemous remarks on a TV show.

Irish media say the Garda dropped the case as there was no injured party.

A viewer had complained about comments made by Fry on a TV show in 2015.

Fry had asked why he should ""respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world.... full of injustice"". He later said he was not ""offensive towards any particular religion"".

News of the Irish investigation on Saturday caused a big stir on social media. The clip of Fry's interview was watched more than seven million times on YouTube.

A controversial law against blasphemy was introduced in 2009. It carries a maximum penalty of a fine of €25,000 (£22,000).

Viewer 'now satisfied'

Speaking to the Irish Independent newspaper, the man who had accused Fry said: ""I did my civic duty in reporting it.

""The guards did their duty in investigating it. I am satisfied with the result.""

The paper says no publicised cases of blasphemy have been brought before the courts since the law was introduced.

In a TV show called The Meaning of Life, hosted by Gay Byrne, Fry had been asked what he might say to God at the gates of heaven.

Fry said: ""How dare you create a world in which there is such misery? It's not our fault? It's not right. It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?""

In 2009 the then government said the law was needed because the republic's 1937 constitution gave only Christians legal protection of their beliefs.",bbc-news

9,Michael Vick says kids can learn from Joe Mixon’s situation | FOX Sports,"The Cincinnati Bengals took a big risk in the second round of the draft, selecting Joe Mixon out of Oklahoma. The pick was met with plenty of criticism due to Mixon’s character concerns, stemming from an incident in which he punched a woman, breaking four bones in her face.

The Bengals are giving him a second chance, as they often do with troubled players. Someone who’s familiar with getting a second opportunity in the NFL is Michael Vick. He served 18 months in prison for dogfighting, only to return to the field in 2009 with the Eagles, and later with the Jets and Steelers.

He shared his thoughts on the Mixon situation, saying kids can learn from what happened to the new Bengals running back.

“Kids can use this as an example,” Vick told NJ Advance Media recently. “Joe got an opportunity because he’s an exceptional talent. Others don’t get that opportunity.”

AP

Vick would obviously never condone what Mixon did, but hopes he can learn from his situation and his mistake to take advantage of the second chance he’s received.

“Joe’s young, man, and he made a mistake. Let’s be honest, you rarely see guys having encounters like that. It should never happen. I would never condone it. I don’t think it’s right at all,” Vick said. “But in terms of his football career, if he could go back and think about it before he actually made that gesture towards that girl, he wouldn’t have done it. Not if he knew what he would be dealing with now. … I think he has learned from it. Hopefully, he’s humbled by what happened to him.”

The Bengals openly admitted that they took a risk on Mixon in the second round, knowing the criticism that would come along with the selection. Mixon himself has showed remorse for his wrongdoing, saying he’s changed since the incident occurred in 2014.

He was suspended from the football team for all of 2015 and saw his draft stock plummet as a result. Mixon is a first-round talent, but he needs to prove he can be a good member of the community and change his image.",fox-sports

9,Check out Lionel Messi's unreal jersey collection in his home | FOX Sports,"Lionel Messi has been playing with Barcelona’s first team for 14 years and Argentina’s for 13 years. In that time, he’s had plenty of time to swap jerseys with opposing players after matches. And seeing as his entire career has been at the highest level, against the best teams in the world, he’s made jersey swaps with most of the best players of his era. None of this is surprising.

What we didn’t know is that Messi has an entire room in his home dedicated to displaying all those jerseys he’s gotten (and a few of his own).

A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 9, 2017 at 12:26am PDT

Some of these jerseys are pretty obvious. Of course he has Francesco Totti, Diego Milito, Philipp Lahm, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero jerseys. It is a little bit surprising that he crossed rivalry lines for Iker Casillas, Raul and Angel D Maria jerseys, though. Of course, there’s no Cristiano Ronaldo jersey to be found.

It looks like the ceiling might be where he keeps his most treasured jerseys, too. Up there he has Thierry Henry, Petr Nedved, Cesc Fabregas and Deco. Not bad.

Being Lionel Messi has its perks. Like unreal jersey collections, and a room to display them.

6,This congressman had a worse Monday than you,"(CNN) Rod Blum held a master class Monday on how not to handle yourself during a Congressional recess.

It all started with an interview with a local TV station. Blum, an Iowa Republican, was surrounded by kids at a youth center when KCRG-TV9's Josh Scheinblum started asking questions -- beginning with one about why Blum was limiting attendees of his town hall Monday night to residents of his 1st district. Things rapidly went downhill

Blum's hair trigger is totally baffling here. Scheinblum isn't even being confrontational! He's simply (lightly) pressing Blum on not allowing certain Iowa residents into a town hall meeting. His follow-up question -- would you accept contributions from people outside the district? -- is totally fair.

Blum's contention that Scheinblum was ""going to sit here and just badger me"" suggests to me that the congressman doesn't know what badgering actually entails -- since that ain't it.

Blum should have quit while he was behind. But, he didn't!",cnn
9,Judge throws out Aaron Hernandez's conviction in 2013 murder | FOX Sports,"FALL RIVER, Mass. — Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez’s conviction in a 2013 murder can be erased because he died before his appeal was heard, a judge ruled Tuesday.

Judge E. Susan Garsh said a legal doctrine that calls for vacating convictions when a defendant dies before an appeal can be heard was binding precedent. She said she was compelled to follow it.

The former New England Patriots tight end hanged himself in his prison cell last month while serving a life sentence in the killing of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd.

Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg had argued that Hernandez “should not be able to accomplish in death what he could not accomplish in life.”

Hernandez’s appellate attorney told the judge that the state’s highest court has applied the legal doctrine “without exception,” even in cases of suicide.

In a court filing last week, Bristol District Attorney Thomas Quinn III argued that a defendant’s death while an appeal is pending does not always require what is known as “abatement,” including when “a defendant’s death is a result of his own conscious, deliberate and voluntary act.”

Hernandez’s appellate lawyers say his conviction in the Lloyd case is not considered final because the automatic appeal he was entitled to had not been heard at the time of his death.

Hernandez, who grew up in Bristol, Connecticut, and played football at the University of Florida, was considered an up-and-coming star during his three seasons with the Patriots. He was cut from the team hours after his arrest in the killing of Lloyd.",fox-sports
6,Trump fires FBI director James Comey,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.

The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.

What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.

The letters

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,"" Trump told Comey in the letter. ""I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

JUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein argued in his memo.

""We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),"" Rosenstein said. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

Congressional reaction

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?"" Schumer asked

And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said.

As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.

""I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.

But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would ""raise questions.""

Sen. John McCain added: ""While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.""

The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.

'Absurd'

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.""

""This is not something that is within the American political tradition,"" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

""This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,"" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.

The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.

A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

Team Clinton reaction

Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called ""charade"" only 24 hours ago,"" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.

""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,"" he said.

One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.

""I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,"" the person said.

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.

Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.

Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin ""forwarded hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop.

The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the ""hundreds and thousands of emails"" that Comey said were 'forwarded"" from Abedin to her husband's email ""included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.""

The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.

Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.

In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.

But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.

Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information.

Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the ""political"" decision.

Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.

After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.

Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""

After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

""Oh, here's Jim,"" Trump said in January. ""He's become more famous than me.""",cnn

But word of the FBI director's firing was met with fear, not joy, on Tuesday.

Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, Robby Mook, the former secretary of state's campaign manager and Brian Fallon, her press secretary, all expressed skepticism at why Comey was fired now -- in the midst of the bureau's investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

""Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation,"" Kaine tweeted in response to the news. ""Comey firing part of a growing pattern by White House to cover-up the truth.""

6,Comey firing troubles top Republicans lawmakers,"(CNN) Top Republicans, including the senator directing the Senate's Russia investigation, said Tuesday they were ""troubled"" by President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey , while other GOP lawmakers tried to stay out of the growing political storm.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said in a statement.

While Democrats slammed Trump's decision on Comey as ""Nixonian,"" some members of the President's own party expressed concerns and divided traditional GOP alliances.

Arizona Sen. John McCain said he was ""disappointed"" by the incident. Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and occasionally advised the Trump campaign last year, said he also had concerns.

Rep. Justin Amash, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said in a tweet that he would introduce legislation supporting the creation of an independent commission to investigate Russia's interference in the election.

Amash is one of four Republicans who have signed on to legislation that would force Trump to release his tax returns.

""While the case for removal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions,"" Corker said in a statement. ""It is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time.""

Other Republicans came to Trump's defense or placed the blame for Comey's firing squarely on the shoulders of the former FBI director.

""Today's announcement is likely the inevitable conclusion of Director Comey's decision last July to bypass the longstanding protocols of the Justice Department and publicly announce the reasons he had decided not to recommend an indictment of Hillary Clinton and to offer his personal views of Mrs. Clinton's actions,"" Republican Sen. Susan Collins said in a statement.

""Any suggestion that today's announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBI's investigation of Russia's attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced,"" Collins said. ""The President did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director.""

The decision also had two traditional Republican allies apparently at odds. While McCain said Comey is ""a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" one of his closest friends -- Sen. Lindsey Graham -- said that he disagreed.

The South Carolina Republican, who is leading one of four investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, said Tuesday he supports Trump's decision.

""Given the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well,"" Graham said in a statement Tuesday. ""I encourage the President to select the most qualified professional available who will serve our nation's interests.""

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he was not commenting on the firing specifically but expected the Justice Department's investigation to continue largely unchanged.

""I would expect the FBI to continue to function along the lines that we have come to expect it to function,"" the Florida Republican told CNN.",cnn

President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says.

The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"".

But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information about Mrs Clinton's emails to Congress last week.

Live coverage of FBI chief's firing

Decoding Comey's testimony

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the Department of Justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately.

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when he was handed a note by one of his team informing him he had just been fired.

The 56-year-old - who was four years into his 10-year term as FBI director - broke the news to his staff.

Why does the administration say Comey was fired?

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the Clinton emails investigation, given that Mr Trump formerly praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.

But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"".

""Almost everyone agrees the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives"".

He said Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 to announce the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.

The deputy attorney general said Mr Comey compounded his error by ""gratuitously"" releasing ""derogatory information"" about Mrs Clinton.

What about the Russia investigation?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer: ""Mr President, with all due respect, you're making a big mistake""

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into Russian whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are investigating the same allegations.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

And it is not just Democrats who expressed concern.

Richard Burr, the Republican head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Jim Comey's termination.""

The development is drawing comparisons with President Richard Nixon's firing of his attorney general, which plunged his presidency deeper into turmoil.

But President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russian allegations are ""fake news"".

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior Justice Department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree. The president didn't help his cause by specifically asserting that he was ""not under investigation"" in his letter to Mr Comey.

Already Democrats are clamouring for the ex-director to testify before Congress about the state of the FBI's Russia investigation at the time of his dismissal.

Just days after becoming president, Mr Trump shook Mr Comey's hand at a White House event and said ""he's become more famous than me"". That may have been an exaggeration at the time.

It seems less like one now.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

He told the Senate last week it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again.

Mrs Clinton blames Mr Comey for her shock election defeat last November to Donald Trump.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had only sent two email chains containing classified information to her husband for printing.

The clarification was made in a letter from the FBI's assistant director of congressional affairs, Gregory Brower, to the congressional committee.

The majority of the 49,000 emails investigators uncovered on the computer of Ms Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner were transferred via backup of her work Blackberry device, Mr Brower wrote.

It relates to claims some campaigning costs in the 2015 general election were wrongly recorded.

The Conservative Party has insisted administrative errors were to blame rather than any intention to deceive.

And it has said some of the spending was correctly declared.

Complex rules

It is alleged the Conservatives spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

Up to 16 police forces across England have submitted files to be considered by prosecutors.

The CPS will consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a breach in the law, and whether a prosecution is ""in the public interest"".

If general election candidates are prosecuted the Conservative Party will have to decide whether to suspend them and replace them as nominees.

The last date for candidates to register for the election is 11 May.

6,General election 2017: Labour and Lib Dems pledge school cash,"Image copyright PA

Labour and the Lib Dems are both making multibillion pound funding pledges to tackle school cash shortages in England.

Labour says it would raise corporation tax to spend £4.8bn on keeping up with rising costs, and £335m so no schools lost out from a funding reorganisation.

The Lib Dems are promising £7bn to protect per-pupil funding levels.

The Conservatives said school spending had reached record levels and attacked the two parties' spending plans.

Headteachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

A new funding formula will also see some schools lose money, although others will gain.

On Monday, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said protecting schools from real-terms cuts in England would mean spending the equivalent of an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner are promising a real-terms funding increase in schools and ""free lifelong education"" in colleges, including restoring the Educational Maintenance Allowance.

This would be paid for by increasing corporation tax from the current 19% to 26% by 2021, Labour said.

""We will invest in schools and in our young people, ensuring no primary pupils go hungry during the day, reducing class sizes so children can learn and teachers can teach, and restoring the maintenance allowance and grants for students in both further and higher education,"" Ms Rayner said.

The Lib Dems claimed their plans went further than Labour's and said details of how they would funded would be provided ""in due course"" in the party's manifesto.

The party said it would also protect further education per-pupil funding in real terms.

'Made-up promises'

Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.

""This extra £7bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already committed the corporation tax rise to other projects.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour's announcement was ""just made-up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans"".

He added: ""The Lib Dems are no better and won't even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.""

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news

Juventus reached their second Champions League final in three seasons with a comfortable aggregate victory over Monaco.

Already leading 2-0 from the first leg, the Italian side extended their advantage when Mario Mandzukic stabbed in after his initial header was saved.

Dani Alves doubled their lead on the night with an instinctive volley from goalkeeper Danijel Subasic's punched clearance.

Kylian Mbappe turned in Joao Moutinho's low cross to pull one back in the second half, but the Ligue 1 side could not pull off an unlikely comeback.

Juventus, who have not won this competition since 1996 and lost 3-1 to Barcelona in the 2015 final, will face either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid in Cardiff on 3 June.

Atletico host Real on Wednesday looking to overturn a 3-0 first-leg deficit.

Is this Juventus' year?

Juventus beat Ajax on penalties to win the Champions League in 1996

Juventus have endured a turbulent time since beating Ajax in the Champions League final 21 years ago.

They were demoted to Serie B in 2006 for their part in a match-fixing scandal, and were stripped of two of their Serie A titles.

But they have risen to become the most dominant team in Italy, winning the league for each of the past five seasons.

Their focus now is Champions League success - and they look well placed to achieve it.

No side has scored more than a single goal against them in a Champions League game this season, while Mbappe's goal was the first they have conceded in the knockout stage.

That is down to the excellent form of goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defensive trio Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli.

Against a free-scoring Monaco side intent on attacking, lesser sides may have relented, but Juve stood firm.

Chiellini, in particular, was outstanding - in the right place to clear a dangerous Benjamin Mendy cross at 0-0 before hooking away from Radamel Falcao at 1-0.

They were two key moments, allowing Juve's forward players to attack with patience and potency.

Kylian Mbappe's goal was the first Juventus had conceded in 689 minutes of Champions League football

Alves excellent again

When Barcelona dismantled Juventus in the Champions League final two years ago, Alves was a key part of the Spanish side.

The full-back, who won six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues with Barcelona, left under acrimonious circumstances last summer and joined Juventus on a free transfer.

There is no doubt Barca's loss has been Juve's gain.

After a slow start, the Brazilian has developed into one of the club's most influential players, and his Champions League experience has been pivotal to Juventus' run to the final.

Having assisted both of Gonzalo Higuain's goals in the first leg he produced a brilliant strike here, calmly guiding Subasic's looped clearance through a crowded box and into the net.

Alves, whose cross also led to Mandzukic's opener, has now been involved in every goal Juve have scored in their last two Champions League games.

Man of the match - Dani Alves

Alves was excellent in the first half, scoring one goal and assisting the other to effectively put the tie beyond Monaco

Unrivalled Juve - the stats

No team has reached the Champions League final on more occasions than Juventus (six - level with AC Milan).

Juve have scored 30 goals in the Champions League semi-finals; no team has scored more (level with Bayern and Real Madrid).

The Turin club are unbeaten in 12 Champions League/European Cup games for the first time in their history (W9 D3).

Mandzukic ended his longest run without a Champions League goal (six games) and is now on 15 in 45 appearances.

Mbappe's goal was Monaco's 150th this season in all competitions; only Real Madrid (158) and Barcelona (160) have scored more from the big five European leagues.

Mbappe became the youngest player to score in a Champions League semi-final (18 years & 140 days).

Thierry Henry (five games) is the only French player to have reached six Champions League goals quicker than Kylian Mbappe (nine).

What next?

Juventus have three games remaining in Serie A, starting with a trip to Roma on Sunday, 14 May. A draw will seal a sixth consecutive league title.

Monaco, meanwhile, switch their focus to domestic matters as they look to win Ligue 1. They are three points clear of Paris St-Germain with three games left and host Lille on Sunday.",bbc-news
3,Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US special forces have been supporting SDF units on the ground

US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says.

Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.

The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.

Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.

The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.

SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.

The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.

The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.

The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.

Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".

Analysis: Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.

The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.

The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.

US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.

A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.

The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.

No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.

""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""

10,Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect in major Windows 10 news,"Moved temporarily a few months back and physically a few hundred miles north compared to last year, Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference is nearly underway.

With the first keynote set to start on May 10 at 8am PT (11am ET / 4pm BST / 1am May 11 AEST) from Seattle, Washington, Microsoft has plenty to chat about this year despite holding a major media event just last week to tout Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop.

The most notable topics we expect to see detailed are Redstone 3, the codename for Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update, Project Neon, Microsoft’s visual makeover-in-progress for the operating system (OS), Cortana and even more mixed reality advancements.

With that, here is everything we can bank on seeing during the Build 2017 keynotes starting May 10.

Redstone 3 gets unearthed

Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program members are, technically, already testing out Redstone 3 as you read this. We know this because features that were originally slated for Redstone 2, i.e. the Creators Update, but missed the deadline are now in testing through the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 (as of this writing): Build 16188.

Chief among those features left on the Creators Update cutting room floor is My People, a feature that brings your favorite contacts directly into the Windows 10 taskbar for easier file sharing and messaging. Expect to see more of this discussed on stage this week.

Other major expected features to be detailed are PDF editing features in Microsoft Edge (already in the latest Insider Preview build), Power Throttling to reduce apps’ power draw on laptops and tablet PCs and further improvements to more transparent automated OS updates.

We also wouldn’t be surprised to see Redstone 3 get its official name and, at the very least, a release window (if not a hard date) since Microsoft has promised two major updates annually.

Cortana branches out

That Harman Kardon unveiled its Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft’s Cortana just days before Build 2017 is no coincidence. With the long-rumored rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home now out in the open, expect Microsoft to spend some considerable time on this initiative.

In fact, controls for Cortana-powered speakers were already found within the earliest Insider Preview builds for Redstone 3. On that note, expect to hear a lot more about how far the Amazon Alexa-like Cortana Skills and device software developer kits have come since their announcement last year.

However, we find it hard to believe that Microsoft will sit on these tools until Redstone 3 becomes a fancy-named update that hits every Windows 10 device. After all, don’t expect Amazon and Google – or even the rumored Apple Siri Speaker – to slow down over the next five months.

Project Neon ... or Aero Glass 2.0

Microsoft’s fateful fall update should see the oft-teased visual overhaul to the Windows 10 interface known currently as Project Neon.

In short, the new visuals bring back a lot of the translucent design elements found in the Aero Glass design ID that started in Windows Vista and were found throughout Windows 7 before being dropped for Windows 8.

Furthermore, Project Neon markedly changes how Windows 10 animations in transitioning between apps look and feel. That said, early previews have stated that Neon is aiming for a simple aesthetic, so we’ll see how Microsoft achieves that balance with new animations in the mix.

Mixed reality gets a huge push

Unless Microsoft plans to give them a spotlight during its May 23 Surface event, Build 2017 would be the place to show even more of its partners’ head-mounted displays (HMDs).

Having already shown off Acer’s HMD at length during the Taiwanese firm’s annual New York hardware showcase, it’d be surprising not to see already-teased partners like Lenovo, Dell and HP not take the chance to get the word out regarding their Windows 10 Holographic devices.

Bonus round: maybe we’ll finally hear about price regarding any of Microsoft’s partners’ HMD devices. It’s a crucial point going into the holiday season, especially when it’s highly unlikely that either HTC or Facebook have 2017 hardware that can match that $299 starting price.",techradar

10,Has Meizu's quick charge tech reinvented the smartphone?,"Do you carry a portable charger for your smartphone? They seem innocent enough, but those small black boxes are like a sticking plaster over the tech industry's gaping wound; pathetic phone batteries not fit for the modern mobile age.

It's not just the Pokémon Go app that drains the life from smartphones, with navigation apps like Google Maps, firmware updates, and even just the camera app eating away at battery life at a worrying rate.

So could a claim by Chinese phone maker Meizu that it now has the technology to recharge a phone in less than 20 minutes change everything?

Super mCharge is expected to be used in phones inside two years. © Jamie Carter

Short battery life is a huge problem for the phone industry, whose minor improvements in power efficiency have been swallowed up by the ever-increasing size of smartphone screens.

""Smartphones have become more power-hungry, and battery life and charging technology has failed to keep pace, leaving users often unsatisfied with the battery life of their devices,"" says James Manning Smith, Information Analyst at Futuresource Consulting.

He points out that manufacturers have three choices when designing a phone; larger batteries in devices, more efficient components, and making charging more convenient for users.

Meizu has taken the middle road with its Super mCharge technology, which it unveiled at a press event at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The live demo saw an empty smartphone fill-up in precisely 18 minutes and 55 seconds.

Not exactly a riveting watch for onlookers, but impressive nonetheless. After over a year of R&D, said Meizu, it had improved the power of a Super mCharge battery to 55W, and accelerated charging speed by 5.5 times.

© Jamie Carter

An industry first

That 55W figure is key. “Meizu's 55W charging is a first for the mobile industry,” says Manning Smith, who confirms that it's a more powerful charging solution than anything already on the market.

“Standard USB charging is 5W, while some OEMs have released phones with 15-18W charging, such as Motorola, Samsung and Oppo.”

The battery inside the Meizu demo phone was 3,000mAh, which is a typical size for a smartphone (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses a 3,000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 claims a 1,960mAh battery), though this one was specially designed by Meizu's engineers to bear more than four times the current so it could work with Super mCharge.

So what has Meizu actually achieved here? As well as taking charging to 55W, Meizu has dramatically accelerated the charging speed.

Technically speaking, Super mCharge uses charge pump technology; comprising two groups of circuits, the charge pump exports half of the voltage after transformation and improves efficiency by 8%.

""Our solution yields 98% efficiency, compared with other companies who struggle to hit 90%,"" claims Meizu.

Super mCharge also uses a USB cable that's been redesigned to carry up to 160W of power, and as a result it does cost three times more than a regular USB cable.

© Jamie Carter

Can the Meizu phone stand the heat?

There are two immediate concerns. Firstly, does fast charging mean the battery won't last very long? Secondly, is all that extra heat generated safe? After all, exploding batteries in smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have made us all nervous.

On the first question, Meizu insists that in tests its 3,000mAh battery retained more than 80 percent of its capacity after 800 charge and discharge cycles, so it should be good for two years' normal use.

On the second concern about safety, Meizu claims that its optimization algorithm means the highest temperature the battery reaches is 39°C/102°F (in an ambient temperature of 22°C/72°F), just a bit higher than body temperature.

Manning Smith explains that since smartphones are very condensed devices, engineering restrictions mean the heat that builds up during high-powered charging can damage the battery, and other components in the phone.

""Meizu has developed a technology that allows the battery to be charged at a very high rate, without exceeding dangerous temperature levels,"" he adds.

Quick Charge 4.0 features on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. © Jamie Carter

This is all impressive stuff, but only if the device can live up to Meizu's promises. ""Once the technology comes to market, it has the potential to set a new standard for wired smartphone charging,"" says Manning Smith.

That should happen during 2019 or 2020, but there's no guaranteed success for Super mCharge. Not only are several other similar innovations expected in that time-frame, but the general trend towards super-fast wired charging for phones looks set to be overtaken by the wireless charging era.

When it comes to super-fast wired charging, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 (QC3.0) for Android devices is the current front-runner, with QC4.0 just announced for new flagship Android phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset – and that includes the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, ZTE Gigabit and some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

QC4.0 claims to charge 20% faster than QC3.0 (which charges an empty phone to 50% in about 30 minutes). That's not as impressive as Super mCharge's promised speeds, but then again it's available already.

Can Meizu's technology compete with wireless pads?

""Wireless charging companies are trying to [create] a world in which charging cables are unnecessary,"" says Manning Smith, who admits that support for wireless charging pads in wider society is in its infancy.

However, Aircharge has been installing wireless charging stations in restaurants, airports and hotels, while IKEA is including wireless charging pads in some furniture.

""Should we see an increase in the availability of wireless charging outlets in our daily lives, there may be less need for fast charging technologies,"" Manning Smith says.

There are also efforts to develop high-wattage wireless charging. Bosch has wireless charging for power tools that it plans to take up to 60W and use in all kinds of mobile devices by 2020, which would surpass Meizu's achievement – while LG has been developing wireless charging pads that bring a fully discharged phone up to 50% in 30 minutes, (so on a par with QC3.0).

“The convenience of cable-free, little-and-often charges that wireless charging can provide may be more convincing for consumers than wired, but quick charging,” says Manning Smith.

So while Meizu's Super mCharge is an exciting achievement, the future belongs not to electrochemical cells, but wireless charging pads – probably starting with your car.",techradar
6,Democrats call for independent Russia probe in wake of Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump fired the Director of the FBI. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has that story. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in the middle of several investigations of possible Trump campaign ties to last year’s Russian meddling in U.S. elections caused a firestorm of protest from Democratic members of Congress, with many calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Some equated the firing with events known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told Trump that he had made a “big mistake” when informed of the decision.

Schumer wondered aloud whether the firing meant Comey’s investigation was “getting too close to home,” and he said the handling of a credible investigation depends on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein naming a “fearless, independent” special prosecutor.

“Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,"" Schumer said.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for the creation of a special congressional committee on Russia, while Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he and his staff were ""reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.""

""James Comey is a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" McCain said.

Comey, a Republican who had served in the George W. Bush administration as second in command in the Justice Department, was the surprise choice of President Barack Obama for the FBI post.

He had established his independence in March 2004 when then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales sought to get Comey’s boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to sign off on a secret National Security Agency wiretap program. Ashcroft, seriously ill in the hospital with pancreatitis, had turned his duties over to Comey, who told Gonzales in Ashcroft’s hospital room that he refused to authorize the program.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the troubled House intelligence committee, said the firing raised profound questions about White House interference in a criminal probe.

“The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff said, likening the event to the Watergate firings.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Trump’s action poses serious constitutional issues, while others called the development “Nixonian.”

“The termination and removal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises the critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last presidential campaign will continue,” Durbin said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate committee probing the Trump-Russia connection, called the firing “outrageous.”

“I have been long been a critic of Director Comey ... but Donald Trump’s decision to fire him now, in the midst of an investigation into Trump associates and their ties to Russia, is outrageous,"" Wyden said. He said Comey should be called to testify before Congress about the status of the Trump-Russia investigation.

“The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who questioned Comey at a hearing before a Judiciary subcommittee this week, said the way Trump is handling the firing “is shocking.”

“No one should accept President Trump’s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly,” Leahy said. “The president has removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country. This is nothing less than Nixonian.”

Leahy also noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president consulted before the firing, was supposed to have recused himself. He said Rosenstein now has no choice but to appoint a special counsel.

A long list of others calling for an independent probe included Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Ben Cardin, D-Md., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., along with good government advocacy groups MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

Others reacted with more measured tones. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said simply that she had been informed by the president of his decision by phone, adding, “the next FBI director must be strong and independent and will receive a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee.”

One of the earliest Republican reactions came from Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: “While the case for removal of (FBI Director Comey) laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

News of Comey’s departure came near the end of an hourlong telephone town hall meeting that House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., was having with constituents. “Lisa in Mendham” said she wanted to know what Congress was going to do now to hold Trump accountable “for his potentially breaking the law in dealing with Russia.”

Frelinghuysen didn’t answer that question directly but gave a positive appraisal of the job Comey has done.

“He had the reputation ... like his predecessor Robert Muller, of being a sort of straight-arrow guy,” Frelinghuysen said. “I do think he was an honorable man and represented an amazing department. I'm surprised he's gone. But in this business, I guess nothing is too surprising.”

Reporters Herb Jackson and Eliza Collins contributed to this story.

USA TODAY

Hillary Clinton (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)

WASHINGTON — After railing against FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, Democrats aligned with her presidential campaign reacted to his firing not with satisfaction — but with deep suspicion.

Among the former Clinton officials weighing in was her campaign manager Robby Mook. Despite frustration and disappointment over the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation, the announcement “terrifies me,” said Mook.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

Brian Fallon, who was a top communications official during the campaign, said he’s “not shedding any tears for Comey,” even as his firing makes him “worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now.”

I'm not shedding any tears for Comey personally -he hurt FBI's reputation- but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) May 9, 2017

In a letter to Comey, Trump cited as cause for the FBI director’s firing his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, including public statements he made leading up to the presidential election. Yet Comey’s judgment over the email investigation has been an issue for several months. As recently as late January, Comey was seen patting Comey on the back during a White House reception to honor law enforcement officers.

What’s new is that Comey’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials is heating up, including whether there is any evidence of collusion between the two as Russia sought to bolster Trump’s campaign and hurt Clinton’s, according to numerous U.S. intelligence agencies.

The firing also comes days after Comey testified before Congress about his handling of the email investigation during which he mistakenly stated that the FBI had obtained thousands of new emails from a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. While the FBI later corrected the misstatement, it appears to have given the White House an opening to fire the FBI director.

Comey came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats throughout the course of the Clinton investigation. It was days before the Nov. 8, 2016, election that Comey announced his team had found additional emails on the laptop of her aide, Huma Abedin, which the Clinton campaign blames for depressing votes in critical battlegrounds that Clinton lost to Trump by a small margin. During the hearing, Comey said he was “mildly nauseous” if his actions had any effect on the presidential election, while insisting he had no choice but to inform the public about the emails.

They also faulted Comey for speaking out about the investigation in July, when he explain why he decided against bringing charges against Clinton.

It was a break with normal FBI protocol, yet Comey may have felt pressure to speak out after former President Bill Clinton drew criticism for boarding the plane and having a private conversation with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

WASHINGTON — White House officials say President Trump based his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday on the ""clear recommendations"" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a memo released Tuesday evening, Rosenstein sharply criticized the FBI chief, saying he mishandled the final stages of investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's treatment of classified State Department emails. The firing was needed to restore public confidence in the agency, Rosenstein concluded.

At the heart of the criticism: Comey's various public pronouncements about the investigation during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. On July 5, Comey held a news conference in which he said no charges would be filed against Clinton. But on Oct 28, Comey announced that the probe had been reopened to examine newly discovered emails. Then, two days before before election, Comey once again weighed in, saying the department still was not recommending charges against the former secretary of State.

Here are key points in Rosenstein's memo:

1. ""The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.""

2. ""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unifies people of diverse perspectives.""

3. ""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.""

4. ""Compounding the error: The director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

5. ""Although the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.""

Needless to say, Comey's firing did not go over well on the Democratic side of the aisle.

The surprise is it took so long.

Is anyone surprised that President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey? Well, yes – some are surprised he did it, and others are surprised it took so long.

How the mighty have fallen. In March, Comey was hailed as “the most powerful person in Washington.” But those who are tagged “most powerful” have a funny way of quickly being shown up, particularly when they serve at the pleasure of the president. In Comey’s case, his power supposedly was based on his ongoing investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 presidential election, an investigation which has turned up nothing of great importance, certainly nothing to substantiate charges of Russia “hacking the election.”

In fact, Comey had been a dead man walking for some time. He was a director without a constituency. He had tried to strike a balance in a sharply divided political environment and wound up alienating both sides. He had to go.

Democrats blame him for Hillary Clinton’s election loss. Just last week Hillary Clinton said if the election were held October 27 she would be the president – that is, the day before Comey’s dramatic note to Congress that he had reopened the FBI’s investigation into her alleged mishandling of classified information through her bootleg email server.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Then two days before the election Comey said “never mind.” The Bureau had hastily reviewed the 49,000 potentially relevant emails it had found on a laptop owned by disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, and nothing there changed its conclusions from the previous July when he had called out Mrs. Clinton for lying but did not recommend prosecution.

Whether this rollercoaster ride had an impact on the election is one question, but Comey’s seemingly erratic behavior so close to an election was quite another. I was at a meeting with some senior members of the law enforcement community when Comey backed off the investigation and they expressed utter bewilderment at what he was doing. It went beyond how this would affect Comey’s career or his reputation; he was potentially tarnishing the Bureau itself. And for all this Comey said he had no regrets.

Republicans have never bought into the story line that Comey cost Clinton the election. And they fault him for not recommending criminal prosecution of Mrs. Clinton for her alleged misdeeds. But their main complaint was that he gave the Russia story more weight than it deserved. In March, Comey revealed that there had been an active counterintelligence investigation on “the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”

This was an unprecedented admission, and may have been an attempt on Comey’s part to make it politically difficult to fire him. Clearly, not difficult enough. And while Comey said he had “no information that supports” the idea that President Trump had been “wiretapped,” the full nature of the surveillance Trump’s campaign and administration have been subjected to has yet to be revealed.

The bottom line was that Comey repeatedly made himself the issue. His mandate was to enforce the law fairly and impartially. Instead he appeared time and again to be gaming the system. A March poll showed that only 17% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Comey. In President Trump’s letter firing Comey he said that the FBI needed new leadership “that restores public trust and confidence in its law enforcement mission.” Fortunately, Comey’s poor approval did not rub off on the FBI itself. A February 2017 poll showed public trust in the Bureau at 80%, making it one of the most trusted institutions in the country. With James Comey gone now the FBI can find a director more worthy of the title.

WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned the political world by firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, an abrupt ending to a tenure marked by political controversies ranging from Trump's connections to Russia to Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails.

Trump says he based his decision on the recommendations from both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a written statement, Trump said that ""the FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement."" The search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.

Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" in a letter released by the White House.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. In his termination letter, Trump agreed Comey was ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

Comey's sudden dismissal calls into question the future of the investigation into Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election.

The FBI is currently in the midst of a full-blown counterintelligence inquiry, exploring charges of possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

Trump even referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation in his termination letter — telling Comey he appreciated him ""informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

Yet Democrats — including some who had previously attacked Comey for his handling of the Clinton probe — saw Trump's move as a blatant attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a reference to President Richard Nixon's decision in 1973 to remove the Watergate special prosecutor.

And Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's decision to fire the man overseeing a federal investigation into his campaign associates' collusion with Russia ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter.""

Schiff, whose panel is conducting a separate investigation into Russia's influence on the presidential election, called for an independent prosecutor ""to restore a modicum of public confidence — now completely lacking — that the criminal investigation will continue without further interference by the White House.""

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is leading a Senate panel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, said he was “troubled’’ by both the timing and reasons for Comey’s dismissal.

""I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee,’’ Burr said. “In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our committee.

“Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees,"" he continued. ""His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.”

A career prosecutor, Comey, held top Justice Department posts in the George W. Bush administration before being appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

He is only the second director fired in the 82-year history of the FBI. President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions in 1993 amid ethics problems. While FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms in order to make them nominally non-partisan, they can still be fired by the president.

As news of Comey's dismissal raced through Washington on Tuesday night, Republicans defended the move as difficult but necessary.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's ""decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.""

Meanwhile, Comey was apparently finding out his own employment status in an unconventional way.

Comey left Washington earlier Tuesday for a speaking engagement, and was not informed of his firing until he saw news reports of it on television while at the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, a person familiar with the matter said.

The abrupt firing came just after the FBI confirmed Comey provided erroneous testimony to a Senate panel about how Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin handled classified emails.

Notably, some of the same Democrats upset about Comey's firing have also previously called for his head, blaming Clinton's loss of the presidency on Comey's unexpected public announcement on Oct. 28 that he was re-opening the investigation into her emails.

Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate two weeks ago as Comey's day-to-day supervisor, also faulted Comey for announcing he had re-opened the case 11 days before the election — and for his earlier July 5 news conference saying no charges would be filed against Clinton.

In a memo to the attorney general, Rosenstein said he did not understand Comey's refusal to acknowledge fault with his actions.

""Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of different perspectives,"" Rosenstein wrote.

How did we get here? A James Comey timeline

Tweets fly fast and furious following firing of FBI head Comey

James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired

Meanwhile, as Comey remains the target of public criticism over his handling of the Clinton case, the Justice Department’s inspector general is in the midst of wide-ranging review of Justice’s handling of the matter, including Comey’s leadership of it.

Last week, Comey disclosed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been interviewed by Justice investigators assigned to the case and expected to be questioned again.

“I have a story to tell,’’ Comey told the panel.

Comey, 56, succeeded Robert Mueller, the longest serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller served for 12 years before leaving the bureau.

A former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan and former deputy attorney general, Comey won plaudits for his independence as a key player in one of the most dramatic moments during the George W. Bush administration.

With then-Attorney General John Ashcroft hospitalized in 2004 with acute pancreatitis, Deputy Attorney General Comey rushed to his boss’ bedside at George Washington Hospital when he learned that then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andrew Card were trying to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize a controversial warrantless eavesdropping program.

Since taking office, Comey has staked out the highest profile of any director since Hoover.

In any venue, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey is hard to miss. Often referring to himself as an “awkward white guy,’’ he was anything but while delivering testimony before Congress engaging audiences in public and private forums.

Even in high-stakes congressional hearings, Comey often operated without written text and rarely sought advice from aides who accompanied him.

His public and controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was only the latest in a string of public positions that the director took that did not always sit well with the White House and the Justice Department — including under Obama's administration.

He bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with the racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and in Birmingham, Ala., and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country—a position that put him at odds with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Obama White House.

He drew the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates last year as the face of the government’s legal battle with Apple Inc., to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. With Apple insisting that creating a way to break into the device's default encryption would be tantamount to giving the FBI a ""backdoor"" that could be used to break into Apple products again and again, Comey described the dispute as the “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’

At another point, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of battling homegrown violent extremists, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred communities across the country, from Garland, Texas to Orlando, Fla. His public concern about the FBI's capacity to confront the growing homegrown threat, prompted lawmakers to question whether the bureau had the resources to deal with it.

As the White House searches for a replacement, FBI Agents Association President Thomas O’Connor called on the Trump administration to proceed with “caution.""

“A change in FBI leadership of this magnitude must be handled carefully and with an eye towards ensuring that the bureau can continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American public from criminal and national security threats,’’ O’Connor said.

“We greatly appreciate Director Comey’s service, leadership, and support for special agents during his tenure. He understood the centrality of the agent to the bureau's mission, recognizing that agents put their lives on the line every day. His focus was to ensure that the bureau’s investigations complied with the law and the constitution, and that agents performed their mission with integrity and professionalism. As vital stakeholders, FBI agents should be given a voice in the process of selecting the next director.”

James Comey, the now former FBI director, became on Tuesday the latest to join the growing list of officials President Trump has fired in the early days of his presidency.

Here's a reminder of who else is in the club, in order of their dismissals:

Sally Yates

Trump's former acting attorney general was a holdover from the Obama administration. Just days into Trump's presidency, Yates was dismissed on January 30 after she refused to defend the first iteration of his travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.

""Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,"" a statement from the White House said.

Mike Flynn

The former national security adviser was mired in controversy in February after news reports surfaced that he had misled officials, including then-Vice President-elect Pence, about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn resigned on February 13, less than a week later.

""Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice-president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador,"" Flynn wrote in a public statement. ""I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.""

Preet Bharara

The former U.S. attorney was another holdover from the Obama administration. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions had asked for the resignations of 46 federal prosecutors. Bharara refused, asserting that he had met privately with Trump after the 2016 election and the incoming president had asked him to stay. He then announced he was fired by Trump on March 11.

On Twitter, Bharara said: ""I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired. Being the US Attorney in SDNY (Southern District of New York) will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.""

Angella Reid

The former chief usher at the White House was unceremoniously fired last week. Reid joined the White House in 2011 under then-President Obama. While Trump officials said it isn't uncommon for staffs to transition between administrations, it is unusual for a chief usher to be dismissed. They typical hold their positions for several years and over a number of administrations. It remains unclear why Reid was let go on May 5.

James Comey

For months, the FBI director has been in the headlines for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her days as secretary of State and, later, for his agency's probe into possible connections between the Trump administration and Russia. His firing was announced on Tuesday, within hours of the FBI sending a letter to Congress that stated Comey had given inaccurate testimony about a Clinton aide forwarding ""hundreds and thousands of emails.""

16,What's up with Melania Trump's cyber bullying campaign? It's 'a work in progress',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a rare campaign speech, Melania Trump said that one of her key issues as First Lady would be to combat cyber bullying Time

Melania Trump, America's historic first lady, pledged before the election that she would lead a campaign against cyber bullying.

But so far, say leaders and activists in anti-cyber bullying efforts, neither Trump nor her East Wing staff have reached out, nor have they responded to offers to help.

""I'm not seeing any movement towards an initiative that she's endorsed,"" says first lady historian Myra Gutin of Rider University in New Jersey. ""She's hired some staff but not up to the level that other first ladies have done by now.""

Trump's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, says the anti-cyber bullying effort is still a work in progress. ""Mrs. Trump is being very thoughtful when it comes to building out her initiatives,"" Grisham said in an email. Also, her staff now numbers 10, and she's taking her time hiring because she values ""quality over quantity.""

Trump herself declined to comment, as she has routinely since she became first lady. But on Nov. 3, 2016, she attracted widespread attention when she announced in a rare speech that she would fight cyber bullying as her first-lady cause if her husband, Donald Trump, were elected.

“Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side,"" she told an audience of suburban women in Berwyn, Pa. ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”

Her declaration brought out plenty of ire on social media from those who consider Donald Trump the definition of a cyber bully given his aggressive social media attacks against anyone who piques his fury.

Lady Gaga, whose Born This Way Foundation aims to combat bullying, especially of LGBT kids, was scathing, though Gaga's representative did not return a message from USA TODAY seeking comment on how she feels about Melania Trump now.

.@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016

But there was no mocking from other anti-cyber bullying activists, who say they remain patient and hopeful that Trump will launch her initiative soon.

""We have tried to reach out to her and offer the services and expertise of our organization; so far, we have not heard back,"" says Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York. Still, ""I’m delighted that Melania Trump chose cyber bullying. I think she could do a tremendous amount for the children and adolescents who are suffering as a result of it.""

Since the election, excited activists have been sending Trump advice and proposals, such as holding an annual online safety summit at the White House, says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.

""We haven’t heard anything from FLOTUS at all (so) I’m not in a position to speak to what she is or is not doing since we’re not connected yet,"" says Hinduja.

He says ""everyone in my line of work has been buzzing"" since Trump's speech. He says ""good progress"" has been made on cyber bullying over the last eight years by the White House, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education.

""And we’re just hoping that there will be continued and even increased support and contributions from the highest office in the land,"" he says. ""That is tremendously exciting for all of us.""

The Family Online Safety Institute welcomed Trump to the cause in December, issuing a set of recommendations such as: Inaugurating an annual Online Safety Summit at the White House; creating a chief online safety officer; and persuading the new administration to set up a $25 million research-and-education fund over five years to create educational programs for children and their parents on cyber bullying and online safety in general.

""We are still waiting to hear from her or her office about how she wishes to take this topic on,"" says Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Washington-based group. ""The only indication we’ve had is that speech before the election. And then, of course, she has mostly remained in New York. So there's not been a great deal of movement yet.

""But of those I've spoken to, including in my own organization, we’re cautiously optimistic.""

Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, says she's not been contacted by Trump's team. ""It’s such important work and there’s a huge need for creating kinder and supportive online and offline spaces, so I hope FLOTUS decides to engage in this important work,"" she says.

Donna Rice Hughes, a key figure in a 1987 political scandal that ended a Democratic presidential campaign, has been a respected leader on Internet safety for kids for more than two decades through her Enough is Enough non-profit. She endorsed Donald Trump and though she hasn't heard yet from Melania, she is convinced it will happen and that mothers especially will relate to the new FLOTUS.

""She is modeling what it means to have a balanced life and the difficulty most women who have families are having in trying to keep that all in balance,"" says Hughes. ""I am not at all concerned or surprised she's taking some time. It's very clear right now her priority is her son. She’s got four years minimum, maybe eight, to deal with cyber bullying.""

Official Portrait of First Lady pic.twitter.com/K1DUVE5kSI — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) April 3, 2017

Could President Trump's online blasts undermine the first lady's cause? Possibly, says Balkam, but it would depend on the specifics of her initiative. If she focuses on, say, child-on-child cyber bullying, ""it's possible nothing he does undermines what she tries to do. But let’s wait and see.""

Combating digital bullying is not a new cause nor an inconsequential one, according to the experts and activists who have been laboring in relative obscurity for years, concerned about analysis (from the Cyberbullying Research Center in Orlando, for instance) showing that two-thirds of students who experience cyber bullying say it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school.

Monica Lewinsky has been a recent high-profile voice on the issue: She called for an end to the ""culture of humiliation"" in a powerful TED talk in 2015. ""Cruelty is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible,"" she said then. ""Millions of people can stab you with their words and that's a lot of pain.""

She would seem to be a perfect ally to Melania Trump — and in fact, she defended the Trumps' young son, Barron, after he was mocked online — but her spokeswoman, Dini von Mueffling, confirmed to USA TODAY that so far Lewinsky has not heard from Trump.

all children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl #barrontrump). let's be better than this. https://t.co/CH3IfdpQpu — Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) January 23, 2017

But nothing beats a first lady's spotlight for focusing attention. So far, Trump has said nothing about cyber bullying in public, except on April 26, when she celebrated her 47th birthday at a lunch for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Grisham confirmed Trump mentioned cyber bullying at the lunch, thanking the group for a donation they made in her name to an anti-bullying organization, which is the tradition of the Senate spouses group for every incoming new first lady. But the lunch was closed to the media at the behest of the group so there's no official transcript.

Soon after the election, Donald Trump said his third wife would not move into the White House immediately after the inauguration; instead, she would remain in New York so that Barron, 11, could finish the school year.

Grisham maintains she's still been ""100% present"" as first lady since Jan. 20, and anyway nowadays people can work remotely from anywhere.

For comparison, Michelle Obama also said her first priority would be her children when she became first lady in 2009, though she immediately was visible and active. She did not fully launch her first initiative, her campaign for healthy eating and against childhood obesity, until nine months after she came to the White House.

""With Mrs. Trump, who's not living here yet and who's just starting to assemble her team, it may take a little longer to roll out her first initiative, but it will be done with a level of full knowledge, research and careful attention to the important data out there on this issue,"" predicts Anita McBride, who worked in multiple administrations, was former first lady Laura Bush's chief of staff and now studies the legacies of first ladies at American University in Washington.

But her absence has been noticed: Stylish and statuesque, the ex-model stands out when she is present, stimulating further curiosity about her. But she remains largely inscrutable; unlike her polished stepdaughter, businesswoman-turned-White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, Melania has not done media interviews about her plans.

Does it matter that Trump has been a slow-starting FLOTUS?

Every new first lady takes a different approach, says McBride, and it's nothing to worry about. ""We may have to get used to, with this new first lady, she's not going to do it the way her predecessors did it; she's going to do it the way it fits her best. That may be more limited but it will be just as impactful.""

First-lady expert Kate Andersen

Brower,

author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,

says she's sympathetic to the notion that Trump needs more time to understand the job. ""While they get a honeymoon period, I think that's quickly coming to an end,"" Andersen Brower says.

Gutin suspects most people don't care, but she thinks Trump is missing an opportunity.

""The tradition is that the presidential spouse gives us some insight into the character of the president, and certainly since Jacqueline Kennedy those of us who care about it have always thought the first lady can use (the White House audience) to do a lot of good,"" Gutin says. ""Does it matter to the success of an administration? Probably not. But there is the opportunity there and she's not taking advantage of it.""

Or not yet, anyway.

Netflix's 13 Reasons Why has yet another reason for getting noticed.

The series, which controversially centers on the suicide of a teenager, has been renewed for a second season.

Their story isn't over. Season 2 of #13ReasonsWhy is coming. pic.twitter.com/nY5vTUfXdo — 13 Reasons Why (@13ReasonsWhy) May 7, 2017

The story is about Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), who has left behind cassette tapes explaining 13 reasons why she took her life.

But all of the tapes were played in Season 1. So what's in store for Season 2? Netflix tweeted out an interview with executive producer Brian Yorkey that reveals a few details about the new episodes, which are expected to hit the streaming service in 2018.

We know that the new season will likely start a few months after the first season's finale, will get a new narrator (though Hannah will still appear on the show) and instead of tapes, will use ""a different sort of analog technology,"" Yorkey says.

Here are a few of the questions that Season 2 will answer, according to Yorkey: ""Is Tyler going to do something? What’s going to happen to Alex? Will Bryce be brought to justice?""

Season 1 had 13 episodes and was executive produced by Selena Gomez, who teased last week that ""maybe"" there would be another season of the series.

She also told the Associated Press that she was proud of the project.

""We stayed very true to the book,"" Gomez said. ""What Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, (the backlash is) going to come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.""

Psychologists, educators and parents have widely criticized13 Reasons' potential to be interpreted as glamorizing suicide, prompted Netflix to add warnings to episodes.

9,'Embarrassed' Matt Harvey apologizes to Mets for skipping game,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey apologized for his behavior that led to a three-game suspension without pay for violating team rules. Time_Sports

NEW YORK — Matt Harvey showed up Tuesday afternoon at Citi Field, rejoining the Mets for the first time since his three-game suspension for missing Saturday's game. It put the spotlight on the pitcher again after a tumultuous long weekend away.

Harvey admitted he had stayed out late Friday night and then played golf Saturday morning, which all led to him not coming to the ballpark that afternoon. Harvey apologized to the Mets Tuesday then came out for a public mea culpa.

“I'm extremely embarrassed for my actions,” Harvey said. “I’m looking forward to getting things back on track and doing everything to help this team win.”

Harvey has the right to file a grievance through the players union against the suspension, but did not say whether he would or not, saying it was no on his mind at this point.

It was not the first time Harvey has had to explain and apologize for his tardiness. He arrived late for a workout prior to the 2015 postseason and professed he wouldn't do that again. Tuesday, he sat in the same place and offered his contrition for doing it again.

“I think people make mistakes,” he said. “I made another mistake.”

The incident and the suspension were the latest rough patch for Harvey this year. He has a 5.14 ERA this season after missing the second half of last season. Now comes another blight on his record.

“I understand that every way you can look at this situation it's completely my fault,” Harvey said. “There's only one thing I can do and that's apologize and sincerely mean that.”

He added: “It's obviously hasn't been an ideal three days for me or for anybody and the last thing I ever want to do again is put me or this team in this type of situation.”

The Mets, at least in the moment, have been accepting of Harvey’s apology and his return. His teammates said they are welcoming him back with open arms. Bartolo Colon, now with the Braves, texted Harvey. But manager Terry Collins says it will be incumbent on Harvey to prove himself.

“I told him he needs to make baseball No. 1,” Collins said. “When he did that he was on top of the world.”

9,UFC finally confirms women's flyweight division launching with 'Ultimate Fighter' 26 | FOX Sports,"Let’s try this one more time.

Last week the UFC announced and then retracted plans to launch a women’s flyweight division with season 26 on “The Ultimate Fighter” with filming expected to start in July.

Now the UFC has finally rolled out the plan — again — to kick off the 125-pound women’s division with the new season of the reality show where fighters from outside the UFC as well as competitors currently on the roster can try out for the season that will crown the first ever champion.

Tryouts will be held on May 23 at the Palace Station Hotel in Las Vegas. Fighters are required to be between the ages of 21-34 with at least three fights and a winning professional record.

The stutter step for the announcement didn’t slow down the excitement for several fighters already competing in the UFC, who have already expressed interest in moving to flyweight once the division opens.

Jessica Eye, who was previously ranked as the No. 1 fighter in the world at flyweight, has already told FOX Sports that if she wins her next bout on July 7 against Aspen Ladd that she plans to move down to 125 pounds.

Former “Ultimate Fighter” competitor Bec Rawlings has also mentioned a potential move to flyweight although it doesn’t appear she’s interested in competing during another season of the reality show after already doing that once previously in her career.

Lauren Murphy has stated that she plans on gunning for a spot on the reality show with an aim to become the first ever women’s flyweight champion in the UFC.

The new season of “The Ultimate Fighter” featuring the flyweights will begin filming in July with the show airing on FS1 later this year.",fox-sports

White joined Colin Cowherd Tuesday on The Herd ahead of UFC 211 this weekend in Dallas, and said that he will eventually walk away from negotiations if the two sides can't agree.

9,Exclusive: 'Range of emotions' for Brad Keselowski after Team Penske final appeal denied | FOX Sports,"On Tuesday, Team Penske failed in their final appeal to the National Motorsports Appeals Panel of penalties suffered after Brad Keselowski’s No. 2 Ford was found to have too much skew in the rear suspension in post-race inspection at Phoenix Raceway in March.

As a result, Keselowski will lose crew chief Paul Wolfe for this weekend’s race at Kansas Speedway – the final race of his three-race suspension. Wolfe was also fined $65,000 for the violation. After finishing fifth in the race, Keselowski and the No. 2 team were also docked 35 points.

Keselowski still remains third in standings despite the points loss, seven points behind Martin Truex Jr. and 14 points ahead of Chase Elliott.

Before making an appearance on Tuesday’s edition of NASCAR Race Hub at 6 p.m. ET on FS1, Keselowski spoke with FOXSports.com about the news.

“It’s not anything that we didn’t expect,” said Keselowski. “The penalty was already there. I would say there is a range of emotions, which go from being glad it’s over to frustration. It is what it is.”

Team Penske XFINITY Series crew chief Brian Wilson will serve as Keselowski’s interim crew chief once again for Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 (7 p.m. ET, FS1). Wilson also filled in during the first two races of Wolfe’s suspension at Auto Club Speedway (March 27) and Talladega Superspeedway (May 7).

Despite the outcome, Keselowski didn’t completely place the blame on NASCAR regarding the situation as a whole.

“We felt like both sides were a little bit wrong between NASCAR and the team,” Keselowski said. “There was a process with an appeals board to really get a third-party in. I thought it was maybe worthy of some type of a compromise to back the penalty down at the very least, if not complete rescind it. That didn’t happen.”

In the first appeal on April 12, a three-member board decided that NASCAR’s penalty was warranted. The final appeal by Team Penske that was originally scheduled for April 26 until appeals officer Bryan Moss fell ill and was ultimately replaced by television executive Roger Werner.

Overall, with two wins on the year at Atlanta and Martinsville, Keselowski was hoping for a different outcome but also ready to move forward.

“A little disappointed and frustrated by that, but also respectful of the entire process,” Keselowski said.

Team Penske also released a statement following the final appeal decision:

“We are disappointed in the outcome of today’s final appeal hearing. While we appreciate the process that NASCAR and the National Motorsports Appeals Panel has put in place to resolve issues like this, we felt like the penalties received following the March event at Phoenix were unjust. Brian Wilson will once again serve as Brad Keselowski’s crew chief this weekend at Kansas Speedway. We’re happy to finally have this behind us as the No. 2 team focuses its efforts on another Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Championship.”

9,Stone Cold Steve Austin explains why he won't make a full-time comeback to WWE | FOX Sports,"WWE fans love nothing more than seeing legendary figures return to the ring after long absences, but arguably the most popular superstar in the history of professional wrestling has no desire to make a full-time comeback. Stone Cold Steve Austin was the latest guest on longtime ring announcer Lilian Garcia’s podcast, and he opened up about his strong disdain for the grueling travel schedules that WWE stars are required to keep.

“I don’t like to travel anymore Lilian. It’s like when I was still in the WWE and my days before that because I give or take have been in the business thirteen or fourteen years until my neck crapped out and I got out of the business, I loved being on the road back in the day.

You know you’re a road warrior, you’re addicted to the road, then all of a sudden you’re out there and you’ve been on the road for ten, fourteen whatever more days and you’re thinking ‘God dang man I really want to go home,’ and then you get home and you’re there for about a day and a half your like ‘man I’m ready to get back on the road.’ So I mean its in your blood.

But once you get out of the business – and it took me three years to get over getting out of the business, and I won’t tell that story because I told that story so many times. But my point is, you know when you’re in the business of being on the road with the WWE, you’re a road warrior and that’s what you do. That’s your life, and you love it. And I’m very passionate about the business, it’s what I wanted to do with my life, it’s the only thing I wanted to do. I didn’t want to come out here and get into acting, I did it because I had to get out of the business of pro wrestling… When you turn back into what I call ‘civilian mode,’ you know, you kind of lose all that interest in traveling.”",fox-sports
9,Watch Dani Alves' perfect first-time volley that all but confirms Juventus' way into the Champions League final | FOX Sports,"Dani Alves has been the bane of Monaco’s existence over two legs for Juventus. He set up both of the Bianconeri’s goals in the first leg, and the Monegasques had no answer for him as the Old Lady came away from the principality with a 2-0 lead.

In the second leg, it was his perfectly lofted ball to the back post that set up Mario Mandzukic’s first goal, and then he doubled Juve’s lead on the day, making it 4-0 on aggregate with a searing first-time volley just before halftime.

Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic was busy from the start against Juve, and he made a few huge saves to keep the Old Lady off the scoresheet early, but there wasn’t much he could do against Alves for the second. He did well to get to Pjanic’s dangerous corner and punch, but his attempted clearance flew straight to Dani Alves and the rest is history.

With the goal, Alves has scored or assisted every single one of Juventus’ four goals against Monaco in the semifinals.

Not bad for a 34-year-old signed on a free transfer.

CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey.

The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.

The subpoenas issued in recent weeks by the US Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Virginia, were received by associates who worked with Flynn on contracts after he was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, according to the people familiar with the investigation.

Robert Kelner, an attorney for Flynn, declined to comment. The US Attorney's Office in Alexandria, the Justice Department and the FBI also declined to comment.

3,Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Australian Senator Larissa Waters with her daughter, Alia Joy

Australian Senator Larissa Waters has become the first politician to breastfeed in the nation's parliament.

Ms Waters, from the left-wing Greens party, fed two-month-old daughter Alia Joy during a vote on Tuesday.

The lower house last year joined the Senate in allowing breastfeeding, but no MPs in either house had done so.

It followed a backlash in 2015 when Kelly O'Dwyer, a government minister, was asked to consider expressing milk to avoid missing parliamentary duties.

""We need more women and parents in Parliament,"" Ms Waters said on Facebook.

""And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable child care, for everyone.""

Flexibility urged

Labor Senator Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged.

""Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world,"" she told Sky News Australia.

""Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby... the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.""

Until last year, MPs in the lower House of Representatives could take babies only into parliamentary offices or public galleries.

Politicians have been permitted to breastfeed in the Senate since 2003.

The subject is a sensitive issue in many parliaments around the world. In 2016, Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa, from the Podemos (We Can) party, was both criticised and commended for by taking her baby into parliament and breastfeeding him.

Last year, a report on diversity in UK politics recommended that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons should be considered.

However, one MP in 2015 warned it could risk ridicule from the tabloid press.",bbc-news
3,Venezuela sees sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Health care workers protested in February in Caracas against President Nicolas Maduro's government, the lack of medicines and low salaries

There has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in Venezuela.

In the first figures released for two years, the Health Ministry said the number of women dying in childbirth was up by 65%, while child deaths were up 30%.

There has also been a jump in illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria.

The figures reflect the country's deep economic crisis which the opposition says the government has mismanaged.

President Nicolas Maduro says the health crisis is caused by medicines being hoarded to encourage a coup against him.

The country has the largest oil reserves in the world but the collapse of oil prices a few years ago led to a recession and a shortage of the foreign currency needed to import equipment, food and medicines.

Venezuelans face shortages of everything from food to vaccines.

Sorry state of hospitals

UN to supply medicines?

In a recent survey, three-quarters of Venezuelans say their health has plummeted, and that they are eating less than two meals a day. Many report losing an average of around 9 kilos (19 pounds).

In the health sector, large numbers of doctors have emigrated. A leading pharmaceutical association has said around 85% of medicines are in short supply.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a critic of the government's health policies, Dr Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist said:

""The striking part is the turmoil in almost all categories that this bulletin addresses, with particularly significant increased in the infant and maternal health categories.""

Many Venezuelans have trekked to the border with Brazil or Colombia to buy medicine there and seek treatment in public hospitals in neighbouring countries.

In Brazil, the state of Roraima declared a state of emergency to deal with thousands of Venezuelans seeking treatment by the public health service in small border towns.

It is not clear why Venezuela's Health Ministry published its figures now. It had stopped releasing figures after July 2015.

The country has been paralysed for over a month by almost-daily increasingly violent demonstrations against the government of Nicolas Maduro with protestors calling for elections.",bbc-news
6,Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Just last week, President Trump was on Twitter accusing FBI Director James Comey of being too soft on his election opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" Trump tweeted May 2.

A week later, Trump sacked Comey — but for the exact opposite reason. Moments after announcing Comey's firing, the White House released a Justice Department letter that claimed Comey had inappropriately disparaged Clinton during the election campaign — and overstepped his bounds in publicly disclosing that he had reopened his investigation into the former secretary of State's emails.

Only Trump knows the real reason for Comey's firing.

But in his letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, Trump issued what appeared a Shakespearean protestation: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote to Comey on Tuesday.

Indeed, Comey was leading what appeared to be an open-ended investigation into Russian interference in the election — and what Trump associates knew about it. ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Comey's firing will have the immediate effect of intensifying calls for an independent investigation to probe that very question.

After all, Comey was thrust into the role of refereeing the 2016 election because political appointees in the Obama and Trump administrations had been seen as incapable of doing so.

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch was forced to recuse herself from the Clinton probe after an ill-considered meeting with former president Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix in the midst of the investigation into his wife's emails.

Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, was fired 10 days into the Trump administration — four days after she warned the White House that Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was susceptible to Russian blackmail.

And Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also had to recuse himself after misleading Congress about his own contacts with the Russian government while he served as a high-profile supporter of Trump's campaign.

So the political maelstrom Comey found himself in wasn't entirely of his own making. Still, Comey did not shun the spotlight that came with those politically sensitive investigations, holding unusually expository press conferences and giving freewheeling congressional testimony.

If there were any doubt that Comey was a pivotal figure in the 2016 presidential election, his firing as FBI director Tuesday should settle the issue for the history books.

It's a history that is still being written.

A timeline of James Comey's FBI controversies,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

James Comey is only the second director in the FBI's storied history to be fired.

In the year leading up to his President Trump's abrupt firing on Tuesday, he was at the center of two controversial investigations: the probe into Hillary Clinton's emails, and the ongoing investigation into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russia during the election.

So how did we get here? Let's take a look back at the key moments of leading up to Comey's recent FBI controversies.

June 2013

President Obama appointed Comey as the seventh director of the FBI. His career included time in the private sector as well as a tenure as deputy attorney general under President George. W. Bush. Succeeding former FBI Director Robert Mueller, Comey was confirmed by the Senate for a full 10-year-term.

""I must be out of my mind to be following Bob Mueller,""’ he said at the time. ""I don't know if I can fill those shoes, but I know that, however I do, I will be standing truly on the shoulders of a giant.""

August 2015

With the 2016 presidential primaries in full swing, the FBI confirmed it was investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State.

July 1, 2016

President Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said she would accept the recommendations from the FBI and career prosecutors on the Clinton email case.

July 2, 2016

Clinton was interviewed by the FBI for 3.5 hours.

July 5, 2016

Comey called Clinton's server ""extremely careless,"" but gave a news conference in which he explained that Clinton would not be prosecuted.

July 6, 2016

Lynch accepted the FBI's recommendation not to charge Clinton.

July 7, 2016

Comey appeared before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and was grilled for his decision to recommend against charging Clinton.

Sept. 7, 2016

Comey wrote a memo to his employees, defending his recommendation.

Sept. 28, 2016

Appearing during a congressional oversight hearing, Comey once again defended his recommendation not to charge Clinton.

""You can call us wrong, but don’t call us weasels. We are not weasels,"" Comey said. ""Whether or not you agree with the result, this was done the way you want it to be done.""

Oct. 28, 2016

Comey announced that new emails had been discovered on the laptop of former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, who was married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and that messages may be related to the Clinton probe. His announcement came 11 days before Election Day

Nov. 6, 2016

Two days before the presidential election, Comey wrote a letter to lawmakers saying that the previous decision not to prosecute Clinton over her emails would stand.

March 20, 2017

During a public hearing with the House Intelligence Committee, Comey publicly acknowledged that the FBI is investigating whether there was collusion between members of Donald Trump's campaign and Russia.

Additionally, Comey dismissed Trump's claims that Trump was wiretapped by the Obama administration.

May 3, 2017

Comey made another trip to the Hill, defending his Oct. 28, 2016, decision to publicly announce the emails found on Weiner's laptop.

""It makes me mildly nauseous that we would have had an impact on the election,"" Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee.

During the hearing, Comey said ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails had ended up on Weiner's laptop because of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. He said Abedin made ""regular practice"" of forwarding emails to her husband, Weiner.

May 5, 2017

After reports surfaced that Comey had misstated Abedin's handling of the emails, the FBI confirmed Comey's erroneous testimony in a letter to lawmakers.

Hours later, the White House announced that Comey had been fired.

6,James Comey's fall,"(CNN) James Comey came to the FBI with a hero's reputation: He famously stood up to President George W. Bush's aides in a dramatic hospital-room confrontation over secret wiretapping.

He had few enemies in Washington when he took the helm of the FBI on a 93-1 Senate vote in 2013.

But by the time President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped him late Tuesday, Comey had few clear friends left in town -- with his reputation under siege. His critics on both the left and the right attacked his handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump's Russia ties , and more.

The sudden firing threw into doubt the independence of the FBI's ongoing Russia investigation and the stability of the bureau itself, which has been wracked by charges that Comey's political meddling in the fall campaign compromised its mission.

The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and other campaign controversies since last fall, but the rapid-fire events on Tuesday added a historic level of drama to a story that has gripped Washington for months.

Not since the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" at the height of the Watergate scandal has the delicate relationship between the White House and the FBI been thrown into such turmoil.

On that night in 1973, President Richard Nixon fired a series of top Justice Department officials after they refused to fire a special prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate abuses.

Democrats, who had savaged Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, reversed course and portrayed him Tuesday not as a villain, but as a victim. They quickly cast the firing in Nixonian terms and accused Trump of trying to quash the ongoing Russia investigation.

Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the firing ""brazen interference"" in the FBI's investigation.

Even Republican Senator Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed concern over Comey's firing : ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" he said in a statement.

Comey said last week at a Senate hearing that he was pained and ""mildly nauseous"" over the thought that his actions might have affected the presidential election.

But he said he had no regrets, and he had shown no indication he thought his job was in jeopardy. He has even ticked off the exact number of days he had left until his 10-year term expired in 2023 -- a term he expected to complete.

The political attacks were a remarkable turn for the 6'8"" Comey, a towering and charismatic figure who had risen to power with seeming effortlessness earlier in his career.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va. in the 1990s, Comey earned high marks for a novel program that saw long prison terms for felons who used guns in their crimes. He was then given the coveted job of US Attorney in Manhattan -- before President Bush tapped him to become the second-ranking official for the entire Justice Department.

In that post, Comey burnished his reputation as an honest broker willing to stand up to power -- even at the risk of his own job.

In 2004, when his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis, Comey refused to sign off on a secret eavesdropping program approved by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks because he believed it might be illegal.

Two of Bush's aides, Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card, raced to the hospital to try to get Ashcroft's bedside signature to continue the wiretapping program.

But Comey, with sirens blazing on his security detail's car, beat them there and raced up the stairs to his boss's hospital room, where Ashcroft stood by his underling's decision.

The episode became a part of the Comey lore when it was first revealed publicly more than a year later.

As director of the FBI, Comey spoke frequently and passionately about distancing the bureau from the dictatorial days of J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign.

On his desk at the FBI, he kept a copy of a letter from Hoover for the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. -- a dark reminder, Comey said, of the bureau's abusive past.

With public opinion turning on him over the Clinton email investigation, however, Comey appeared to realize that he was becoming increasingly isolated after years of stardom.

At a memorial service for a prosecutor held at a packed Justice Department auditorium just days before the November election, Comey joked sardonically in a eulogy about how unpopular he seemed to have become in the eyes of some colleagues.

His own memorial service, he suggested, would no doubt be held in a much smaller venue.",cnn
6,Firing James Comey is Donald Trump's most unpredictable and dangerous move yet,"(CNN) James Comey found out he had been fired as FBI director just like the rest of us: By watching it on television.

The move, announced late Tuesday via a letter sent from President Donald Trump to Comey, marked the most unpredictable moment of a presidency that through its first 100-plus day has been the least orthodox in memory. It also ramped up criticism of Trump's judgments -- Comey was tasked with leading the investigation into Russia's meddling into the 2016 campaign and what, if any, collusion had occurred between Trump campaign operatives and Russian intelligence officials -- and left official Washington reeling over a move considered unthinkable as recently as this week.

The explanation for the move, which emerged into the stunned silence it caused, made little logical sense. A report from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein highlighted Comey's handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server as the main reason for his dismissal. Rosenstein accused Comey of an attempt to ""usurp"" the power of the attorney general by announcing publicly that he didn't believe any charges should be brought against Clinton in a July 5, 2016 press conference.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein added. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

That echoes criticism launched by Democrats loyal to Clinton, who insisted that Comey's decision to offer his own unvarnished view of Clinton's conduct vis-a-vis her private email server -- he said she had been ""extremely careless"" -- went well beyond his proscribed duties.",cnn

WASHINGTON – James Comey was supposed to have at least six more years in his term as FBI director.

Now that he’s been abruptly fired by President Trump, the White House has launched a search to replace him.

Who could take his place? Neither the FBI nor Justice Department would provide any leads. But there could be some clues.

Four years ago, when then-President Barack Obama selected Comey to succeed Robert Mueller, his name came from a list of potential candidates who may now have a new chance at the office.

The most-discussed names in that pool included some of most familiar names in national law enforcement, along with a former member of Congress.

Before Comey’s selection was announced in 2013, former Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, was the favorite of the FBI Agents Association, a group of 13,000 current and former agents.

""Chairman Rogers exemplifies the principles that should be possessed by the next FBI director,"" then-FBIAA President Konrad Motyka said at the time, announcing the association's support for Rogers. ""His unique and diverse experience as a veteran FBI agent and member of Congress will allow him to effectively lead the men and women of the bureau as they continue their work to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats.""

Ken Wainstein, a former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, was another favorite.

Earlier this week, Wainstein made a public appearance, even though he stayed off to the sidelines. He served as counsel to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a Monday appearance before a Senate subcommittee exploring Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Previously, he served as the FBI's general counsel and Mueller's chief of staff at the bureau.

At the Justice Department, Wainstein also once served as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., and the director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, where he oversaw the operations of 94 federal prosecutors' offices in the U.S.

Another potential pick: John Pistole. Before his appointment as president of Anderson University in Indiana three years ago, the former deputy director of the FBI, had won notice for his steady direction of the Transportation Security Administration.

Pistole also is a close friend of Comey who attended the former TSA director's induction as Anderson University president.

Some current and former FBI agents also have pointed to Michael Mason, a former executive assistant FBI director, as a candidate for the top job.

Before leaving the bureau, Mason oversaw criminal and cyber investigations, coordinated international operations and the bureau's crisis response operations.

Two former New York officials were also linked to previous discussions about top jobs at the bureau and the Justice Department: former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Giuliani, a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign, had been considered for a number of positions in the new administration, including attorney general and secretary of State. Meanwhile, Kelly is an executive at a private security firm.

As the search continues, the FBI is being headed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

But McCabe, who helped oversee the bureau's contentious investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, also has drawn heat.

McCabe's wife, a candidate for state office in Virginia, was the recipient of nearly $500,000 raised by an organization linked to Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The FBI claimed that the deputy director played no role in the campaign.

What does it say about your presidency when Richard Nixon's presidential library is mocking you?

""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian,"" the library tweeted Tuesday within a couple hours of the announcement of President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey.

FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector#notNixonianpic.twitter.com/PatArKOZlk — RichardNixonLibrary (@NixonLibrary) May 9, 2017

It's true that Nixon never fired a FBI director. That honor goes to Bill Clinton, who was the first (and up until Tuesday, the only) president to fire a FBI director. Back in 1993, Clinton fired William Sessions over ethical concerns. Sessions had refused to step down voluntarily.

Still, #Nixonian was trending Tuesday night after Comey's firing. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon made a controversial move when he ordered the firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor charged with the investigation into the Watergate scandal. That led to the resignations of his attorney general, Elliott Richardson, and his deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus.

6,Comey firing troubles top Republican lawmakers,"(CNN) Top Republicans, including the senator directing the Senate's Russia investigation, said Tuesday they were ""troubled"" by President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey , while other GOP lawmakers tried to stay out of the growing political storm.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said in a statement.

While Democrats slammed Trump's decision on Comey as ""Nixonian,"" some members of the President's own party expressed concerns and divided traditional GOP alliances.

Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.

Arizona Sen. John McCain said he was ""disappointed"" by the incident. Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and occasionally advised the Trump campaign last year, said he also had concerns.

""Regardless of how you think Director Comey handled the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle, the timing of this firing is very troubling,"" said Sen. Bob Sasse of Nebraska in a statement.

Rep. Justin Amash, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said in a tweet that he would introduce legislation supporting the creation of an independent commission to investigate Russia's interference in the election.

Amash is one of four Republicans who have signed on to legislation that would force Trump to release his tax returns.

""While the case for removal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions,"" Corker said in a statement. ""It is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time.""

Other Republicans came to Trump's defense or placed the blame for Comey's firing squarely on the shoulders of the former FBI director.

""Today's announcement is likely the inevitable conclusion of Director Comey's decision last July to bypass the longstanding protocols of the Justice Department and publicly announce the reasons he had decided not to recommend an indictment of Hillary Clinton and to offer his personal views of Mrs. Clinton's actions,"" Republican Sen. Susan Collins said in a statement.

""Any suggestion that today's announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBI's investigation of Russia's attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced,"" Collins said. ""The President did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director.""

The decision also had two traditional Republican allies apparently at odds. While McCain said Comey is ""a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" one of his closest friends -- Sen. Lindsey Graham -- said that he disagreed.

The South Carolina Republican, who is leading one of four investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, said Tuesday he supports Trump's decision.

""Given the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well,"" Graham said in a statement Tuesday. ""I encourage the President to select the most qualified professional available who will serve our nation's interests.""

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he was not commenting on the firing specifically but expected the Justice Department's investigation to continue largely unchanged.

""I would expect the FBI to continue to function along the lines that we have come to expect it to function,"" the Florida Republican told CNN.

Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who's up for re-election next year, tweeted that he couldn't explain Trump's decision.",cnn
9,Spurs win epic Game 5 over Rockets with Kawhi Leonard on the bench in OT | FOX Sports,"The Spurs got a 110-107 overtime win over the Rockets in Tuesday’s Game 5 to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. And they did it with their best player in Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entire overtime session.

Leonard suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury earlier in the game, and tried his best to play through it. But once it became clear that he couldn’t go, Gregg Popovich made the difficult decision to bench him down the stretch. Thanks to huge plays from Danny Green and Manu Ginobili — along with some brutal offensive possessions from James Harden and the Rockets, especially in overtime — San Antonio was able to win in spite of Leonard’s absence.

Almeida (22-1) has been one of the most thrilling fighters competing at 135 pounds since his arrival in the UFC nearly three years ago.

Most recently, Almeida dispatched Albert Morales in the second round, which marked his 17th career victory by way of knockout or TKO.

Almeida’s only setback in the UFC came to current bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt, but now he’s ready to resume his course towards title contention as he faces a tough challenge in Rivera in July.

9,Dana White: 'There's going to be a point where I'm done' pursuing McGregor vs. Mayweather | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White committed to doing everything possible to land Conor McGregor a lucrative payday against Floyd Mayweather, but the fight is still no closer to reality.

On Saturday night after Saul “Canelo” Alvarez dished out a punishing decision in his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., his next bout against Gennady Golovkin was announced for September 16.

That was the date originally reserved for the proposed matchup between McGregor and Mayweather, but White says he just wasn’t able to strike a deal with both sides in time so a different boxing match scooped up that Saturday on the schedule.

“The reason they got my date is because I couldn’t get my deal done on time so they got the date,” White told “The Herd” on Tuesday. “Listen, life moves on, we don’t wait for anybody. The fights are going to keep rolling. I didn’t get the deal done fast enough so I lose the date. That’s how it works.”

A date being targeted for the fight might make it appear that a deal is imminent but White says that couldn’t be further from the truth.

In fact, he says he’s no closer to closing the negotiations to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather and there will come a day when he is forced to give up if the two sides can’t reach an amicable agreement.

“I’m not hinting that it’s getting close at all. I knew that this thing was going to be a nightmare to get done if it can even be done. We’ll find out,” White said. “Obviously, both guys want to fight each other but what’s the deal. Can the deal be done? That’s the question.

“It’s not just Mayweather. It’s both sides of this thing are going to be hard to get done. Absolutely, there’s going to be a point where I’m done. This isn’t what I do, this isn’t my business and I’m definitely going to walk away.”

White can’t say for certain when that deadline will be reached where he’ll no longer participate in the negotiations, but he promises it could eventually happen.

As much as he wants to put the fight together for McGregor, who stands to potentially make up to nine-figures for the bout, White will eventually reach his breaking point.

“Either way, it doesn’t matter to me. I know that these two guys want to fight. I’ve said many times, I respect Conor and I’d like to do this fight for him but it’s got to be the right deal. We have to get the right deal done or it’s not going to happen,” White said. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t what I do. The UFC is what I do and I should be focusing on that and not a boxing match.

“Obviously, a lot of people want to see it, there’s a lot of interest in it, but it’s not really what I do.”",fox-sports
6,Trump once cheered Comey for the same reason he just fired him,"(CNN) Eight days before Donald Trump won the presidency, he singled out FBI director James Comey for a special round of praise during a speech to supporters in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

""It took guts for director Comey to make the move that he made,"" Trump said of the FBI chief's decision to make public the bureau's revived probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server. ""It took a lot of guts.""

But on Tuesday night, with the FBI now investigating the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia, the White House, acting on advice from the Justice Department, fired Comey.

Their stated reason?

His handling of the Clinton email case.

""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in a letter explaining his reasoning.

He added, without irony, that Comey had been wrong to use his July press conference, in which he publicly cleared Clinton, to ""release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" a reference to Comey's broadly critical remarks about Clinton's behavior.

While Trump railed against the initial announcement, he openly celebrated the FBI director's letter to Congress, delivered on October 28 -- when early voting had already begun in some states -- that his investigators were examining newly discovered emails that ""appear to be pertinent"" to the server probe.

In the end, there was nothing newly pertinent to the probe. But in the meantime, Trump crowed.

""I really disagreed with him (in July), I was not his fan,"" he said in Michigan on Halloween. ""But I'll tell you what -- what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back. He's got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing.

""But what he did,"" Trump continued, ""was the right thing.""

Then last week, after Comey's most recent testimony, Trump tweeted the FBI director was the ""best thing"" that could have happened to Clinton because he ""gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!""

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

Democrats, too, have changed their tune in the aftermath of Comey's shock firing. In particular, top Clinton campaign staffers, many of whom -- along with the candidate herself -- believe his ""October surprise"" helped deliver Trump the White House.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation,"" former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.

6,Comey firing draws comparisons to Nixon,"Story highlights Richard Nixon ordered Watergate special prosecutor to be fired in 1973

Trump critics call for appointment of special prosecutor to investigate alleged dealings between Trump campaign and Russia

(CNN) The ""Saturday Night Massacre"" was one of the most dramatic turns of events in the Watergate scandal -- the political drama that rocked the United States in the 1970s and led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

President Nixon and the Attorney General's office were locked in a political standoff over Nixon's refusal to comply with orders to release recordings of White House conversations.

Richard Nixon, left, and Archibald Cox, right.

Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than comply with the order. Cox was eventually fired by the US solicitor general.

Critics of President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey see similiarities between Cox's firing decades ago and Trump's action on Tuesday.

The Trump administration, critics say, is trying to undermine the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, just as Nixon tried to stop lawmakers from learning the truth about his role in the Watergate scandal.

9,Kawhi Leonard clarifies his Game 6 injury status after sitting out OT in Spurs win | FOX Sports,"The San Antonio Spurs found a way to win Game 5, but they seemed to take a big blow along the way.

Kawhi Leonard suffered a lower leg injury in the second half on Tuesday when he landed on James Harden’s foot, an injury that forced the two-time Defensive Player of the Year to miss San Antonio’s final possession of regulation and the entirety of overtime.

But the Spurs got some good news after the game. Leonard, who was walking with a pronounced limp, told reporters he won’t miss Game 6 on Thursday in Houston.

""Yeah, I'm gonna be able to play."" -Kawhi Leonard (ankle) #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/ZXwGtqcQMa — NBA TV (@NBATV) May 10, 2017

LEONARD: “It’s a little sore, but I mean, my teammates did a good job of closing out that game with me not being able to go that last stretch.”

REPORTER: “Is it an ankle or knee?”

LEONARD: “Ankle.” […]

REPORTER: “Pop said you wanted to play, but it was obvious that you needed to come out. How severe of an injury is it? Do you think you’ll be able to play in Game 6?”

LEONARD: “Yeah, I’m going to be able to play.”

Leonard naturally struggled for most of the second half following the injury, finishing with 22 points on 8-for-21 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and four assists.

The Spurs got a huge boost from Manu Ginobili with Leonard on the bench, as the 15-year veteran came up with a massive block on Harden on the final possession of overtime to seal San Antonio’s win.

The question now for the Spurs is how limited Leonard might be in a must-win Game 6 for the Rockets. Even before the Leonard injury, San Antonio reverted to its switch-heavy defense, rather than having its franchise player try to lock down Harden for most of the night.

If Leonard isn’t 100 percent on Thursday, it stands to reason the Spurs would use a similar defensive tactic, encouraging Harden to attack mismatches in isolation instead of running the typical Houston offense.

Either way, Game 6 should be a ton of fun.",fox-sports
6,James Comey's fall,"(CNN) James Comey came to the FBI with a hero's reputation: He famously stood up to President George W. Bush's aides in a dramatic hospital-room confrontation over secret wiretapping.

He had few enemies in Washington when he took the helm of the FBI on a 93-1 Senate vote in 2013.

But by the time President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped him late Tuesday, Comey had few clear friends left in town -- with his reputation under siege. His critics on both the left and the right attacked his handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump's Russia ties , and more.

The sudden firing threw into doubt the independence of the FBI's ongoing Russia investigation and the stability of the bureau itself, which has been wracked by charges that Comey's political meddling in the fall campaign compromised its mission.

The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and other campaign controversies since last fall, but the rapid-fire events on Tuesday added a historic level of drama to a story that has gripped Washington for months.

Not since the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" at the height of the Watergate scandal has the delicate relationship between the White House and the FBI been thrown into such turmoil.

On that night in 1973, President Richard Nixon fired a series of top Justice Department officials after they refused to fire a special prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate abuses.

Democrats, who had savaged Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, reversed course and portrayed him Tuesday not as a villain, but as a victim. They quickly cast the firing in Nixonian terms and accused Trump of trying to quash the ongoing Russia investigation.

Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the firing ""brazen interference"" in the FBI's investigation.

Even Republican Senator Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed concern over Comey's firing : ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" he said in a statement.

Comey said last week at a Senate hearing that he was pained and ""mildly nauseous"" over the thought that his actions might have affected the presidential election.

But he said he had no regrets, and he had shown no indication he thought his job was in jeopardy. He has even ticked off the exact number of days he had left until his 10-year term expired in 2023 -- a term he expected to complete.

The political attacks were a remarkable turn for the 6'8"" Comey, a towering and charismatic figure who had risen to power with seeming effortlessness earlier in his career.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va. in the 1990s, Comey earned high marks for a novel program that saw long prison terms for felons who used guns in their crimes. He was then given the coveted job of US Attorney in Manhattan -- before President Bush tapped him to become the second-ranking official for the entire Justice Department.

In that post, Comey burnished his reputation as an honest broker willing to stand up to power -- even at the risk of his own job.

In 2004, when his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis, Comey refused to sign off on a secret eavesdropping program approved by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks because he believed it might be illegal.

Two of Bush's aides, Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card, raced to the hospital to try to get Ashcroft's bedside signature to continue the wiretapping program.

But Comey, with sirens blazing on his security detail's car, beat them there and raced up the stairs to his boss's hospital room, where Ashcroft stood by his underling's decision.

The episode became a part of the Comey lore when it was first revealed publicly more than a year later.

As director of the FBI, Comey spoke frequently and passionately about distancing the bureau from the dictatorial days of J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign.

On his desk at the FBI, he kept a copy of a letter from Hoover for the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. -- a dark reminder, Comey said, of the bureau's abusive past.

With public opinion turning on him over the Clinton email investigation, however, Comey appeared to realize that he was becoming increasingly isolated after years of stardom.

At a memorial service for a prosecutor held at a packed Justice Department auditorium just days before the November election, Comey joked sardonically in a eulogy about how unpopular he seemed to have become in the eyes of some colleagues.

His own memorial service, he suggested, would no doubt be held in a much smaller venue.",cnn
6,Trump fires FBI director James Comey,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.

The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.

What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.

The letters

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,"" Trump told Comey in the letter. ""I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein argued in his memo.

""We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),"" Rosenstein said. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

Congressional reaction

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?"" Schumer asked

And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said.

As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.

""I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.

But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would ""raise questions.""

Sen. John McCain added: ""While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.""

The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.

'Absurd'

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.""

""This is not something that is within the American political tradition,"" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

""This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,"" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.

The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.

A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

Team Clinton reaction

Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called ""charade"" only 24 hours ago,"" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.

""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,"" he said.

One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.

""I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,"" the person said.

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.

Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.

Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin ""forwarded hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop.

The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the ""hundreds and thousands of emails"" that Comey said were 'forwarded"" from Abedin to her husband's email ""included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.""

The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.

Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.

In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.

But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.

Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information.

Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the ""political"" decision.

Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.

After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.

Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""

After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

""Oh, here's Jim,"" Trump said in January. ""He's become more famous than me.""",cnn
6,Trump's letter firing FBI Director James Comey,"(CNN) President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. Here are White House press secretary Sean Spicer's announcement, the letter to Comey from Trump, the letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the memo from the deputy attorney general.",cnn
6,Inside James Comey's seismic firing,"Washington (CNN) A little past 5 p.m. on Tuesday, a black Ford Taurus slowed to a stop just outside FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatched a white-haired man in a dark suit.

He emerged from the car alone, a manila folder in his right hand, and walked slowly toward the agency's appointment gate. Passersby paid little notice.

But Keith Schiller, President Donald Trump's pugnacious former bodyguard who now sits sentry outside the Oval Office doors, was at the law enforcement agency armed with a bombshell message from his longtime boss to FBI Director James Comey: ""You are hereby terminated and removed from office.""

Schiller emerged from the building just short of an hour later, the manila folder gone. By then, the stunning intent of his visit to the FBI was known, and the ramifications of a sitting president firing the man investigating his campaign's ties to Russia were reverberating across Washington.

This account of the lead-up and the aftermath of Trump's decision is based on interviews with more than two dozen officials at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI and on Capitol Hill, nearly all of whom spoke anonymously to describe an extraordinarily sensitive moment for Trump and his presidency.

Backlash begins

Backlash was swift, with claims from Democrats that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia. Even some Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were troubled by the development and its timing. Comparisons to Richard Nixon, who fired a special prosecutor probing the Watergate burglary, began flying.

The White House insisted the firing came amid questions about Comey's handing of a probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. But that explanation was betrayed by Trump's letter, which didn't mention those concerns, focusing instead on the continuing inquiry into his campaign's Russia ties.

Officials in the West Wing, many of whom weren't aware Trump was planning to fire Comey, appeared caught off guard by the furor.

The collective recoil against the move prompted urgent meetings among Trump's aides to manage the fallout. Hours after telling reporters that the White House would have no additional comment beyond Trump's own words, top aides were marched to television cameras on the North Lawn to explain the decision.

One source familiar with the President's reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.

Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

Closely held decision

The idea of firing Comey was closely held within the West Wing, these officials say, where the few aides who were aware of Trump's intentions barely discussed the topic among themselves. Among those looped in: Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who began fine-tuning their rationale for removing Comey from his post shortly after learning of Trump's intentions.

On Tuesday, they had their explanation: Comey mishandled the investigation into Clinton's emails.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails,"" Rosenstein wrote in a letter that the White House released Tuesday. ""I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.""

By the time the memo was complete, Trump was already preparing to execute his decision. His schedule was almost entirely cleared on Monday and Tuesday except for meetings with his national security team. Nearly as soon as Comey's firing was announced, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director, to gauge the agency's No. 2 before elevating him to acting director following Comey's dismissal.

Meanwhile, back at FBI headquarters, news was quickly spreading that Comey was being ushered out. Instead of delivering Trump's letter to Comey in person, Schiller deposited the document at his office. Comey, in fact, wasn't at his agency's headquarters at all when Schiller arrived with the missive from the President; he was addressing agents at the FBI's Los Angeles field office when news came down that Trump had demanded his resignation.

Instead of learning from Trump's letter that he was being fired, Comey found out from television. TVs set to cable news inside the room he was speaking began airing reports of his demise midway through his speech. He made a joke about it to lighten the situation, phoned back to FBI headquarters, and received official confirmation that his tenure atop the law enforcement agency was over.

'I have no reason to believe ...'

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials speaking Tuesday said they were unaware that Trump was preparing to fire Comey, describing themselves afterward as shocked by the development.

Asked hours before announcing the decision whether Trump maintained confidence in Comey, Spicer avoided answered forthrightly.

""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said. ""I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this.""

The decision came at an uneasy moment for the Justice Department, which has been at the center of controversy since Trump assumed office in January. Officials described tensions that have festered over the past several months between Justice Department leadership and senior staff at the FBI over the handling of the Clinton investigation and how Comey was running the agency, according to multiple officials.

Meanwhile, the White House and Sessions have pushed the FBI to pursue leaks of classified information to the media, according to one Justice Department official, urging the agency to prioritize the probe over other matters, including the investigation into Russian election meddling.

One Justice official suggested there could be more changes coming at the FBI beyond Comey's removal.

""There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,"" one official said.

Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before Trump fired Comey.

Shock and confusion

While a handful of top senators were given a heads-up by Trump, the overwhelming sentiment on Capitol Hill was one of shock and confusion.

In some GOP offices, there was an open question of how exactly to respond, with communications staffers reaching out to their colleagues to try and unify their initial draft statements. Without advance notice or guidance from the White House at the start, many offices were stuck in a holding pattern, according to several aides for Republican senators.

For several senators, including some on the Senate judiciary or intelligence committees that oversee the FBI, it was news alerts on their mobile phones or reporters in hallways who broke the news of Comey's removal.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, was presiding over the Senate when the news hit.

""Basically, the parliamentarian told me,"" Rubio told reporters as he walked off the Senate floor. ""I don't have any initial reaction because I don't have any information.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, never shy about expressing his views on an issue, emerged from another senator's office to tell reporters he would be withholding judgments until he had a better handle on what had just occurred.

Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a member of the intelligence committee, told reporters he was ""surprised"" by the firing, and wasn't given a heads-up by the White House.

For Senate Democrats, it was a more straightforward process. Within 20 minutes, statement after statement began rolling out of Democrats questioning Trump's motives -- and using the firing to try and spark new momentum for a special prosecutor or independent commission to look into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.

For members of the House, currently out on recess, it was a scramble by their top staffers to try and get in touch and even brief them on the news. Some lawmakers are out of the country. Others were just about to walk into town halls. Many senior staffers had already departed for the evening by the time the news broke.

Lavrov had planned to be in Washington Wednesday to meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson and Lavrov are scheduled to meet earlier Wednesday to discuss Ukraine, Syria and bilateral issues, the State Department announced.

In addition to the tensions between Washington and Moscow over geopolitics, the meetings between Tillerson and Lavrov, and now between Trump and the Russian foreign minister, come against a backdrop of recriminations over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections and the firing of FBI director James Comey.

Comey was dismissed Tuesday , the White House announced, sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign team colluded with Russia in its alleged interference in last year's election.

6,Comey firing draws comparisons to Nixon,"Story highlights Richard Nixon ordered Watergate special prosecutor to be fired in 1973

Trump critics call for appointment of special prosecutor to investigate alleged dealings between Trump campaign and Russia

(CNN) The ""Saturday Night Massacre"" was one of the most dramatic turns of events in the Watergate scandal -- the political drama that rocked the United States in the 1970s and led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

President Nixon and the Attorney General's office were locked in a political standoff over Nixon's refusal to comply with orders to release recordings of White House conversations.

Richard Nixon, left, and Archibald Cox, right.

Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than comply with the order. Cox was eventually fired by the US solicitor general.

Critics of President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey see similiarities between Cox's firing decades ago and Trump's action on Tuesday.

The Trump administration, critics say, is trying to undermine the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, just as Nixon tried to stop lawmakers from learning the truth about his role in the Watergate scandal.

6,General election 2017: Labour and Lib Dems pledge school cash,"Image copyright PA

Labour and the Lib Dems are both making multibillion pound funding pledges to tackle school cash shortages in England.

Labour says it would raise corporation tax to spend £4.8bn on keeping up with rising costs, and £335m so no schools lost out from a funding reorganisation.

The Lib Dems are promising £7bn to protect per-pupil funding levels.

The Conservatives said school spending had reached record levels and attacked the two parties' spending plans.

Headteachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

A new funding formula will also see some schools lose money, although others will gain.

On Monday, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said protecting schools from real-terms cuts in England would mean spending the equivalent of an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner are promising a real-terms funding increase in schools and ""free lifelong education"" in colleges, including restoring the Educational Maintenance Allowance.

This would be paid for by increasing corporation tax from the current 19% to 26% by 2021, Labour said.

""We will invest in schools and in our young people, ensuring no primary pupils go hungry during the day, reducing class sizes so children can learn and teachers can teach, and restoring the maintenance allowance and grants for students in both further and higher education,"" Ms Rayner said.

The Lib Dems claimed their plans went further than Labour's and said details of how they would funded would be provided ""in due course"" in the party's manifesto.

The party said it would also protect further education per-pupil funding in real terms.

'Made-up promises'

Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.

""This extra £7bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already committed the corporation tax rise to other projects.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour's announcement was ""just made-up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans"".

He added: ""The Lib Dems are no better and won't even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.""

BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys says schools in England have been experiencing a financial squeeze for the first time in 20 years, and plans for the different funding formula have galvanised lobbying by headteachers and parents.

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news

Prosecutors are expected to announce on Wednesday whether Conservative politicians or officials will face charges for breaches of expenses rules.

The CPS is considering files sent by police following investigations in up to 27 constituencies.

It relates to claims some campaigning costs in the 2015 general election were wrongly recorded.

The Conservative Party has insisted administrative errors were to blame rather than any intention to deceive.

And it has said some of the spending was correctly declared.

Complex rules

It is alleged the Conservatives spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

Up to 16 police forces across England have submitted files to be considered by prosecutors.

The CPS will consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a breach in the law, and whether a prosecution is ""in the public interest"".

If general election candidates are prosecuted the Conservative Party will have to decide whether to suspend them and replace them as nominees.

The last date for candidates to register for the election is 11 May.

Australian Senator Larissa Waters has become the first politician to breastfeed in the nation's parliament.

Ms Waters, from the left-wing Greens party, fed two-month-old daughter Alia Joy during a vote on Tuesday.

The lower house last year joined the Senate in allowing breastfeeding, but no MPs in either house had done so.

It followed a backlash in 2015 when Kelly O'Dwyer, a government minister, was asked to consider expressing milk to avoid missing parliamentary duties.

""We need more women and parents in Parliament,"" Ms Waters said on Facebook.

""And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable child care, for everyone.""

Flexibility urged

Labor Senator Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged.

""Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world,"" she told Sky News Australia.

""Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby... the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.""

Until last year, MPs in the lower House of Representatives could take babies only into parliamentary offices or public galleries.

Politicians have been permitted to breastfeed in the Senate since 2003.

The subject is a sensitive issue in many parliaments around the world. In 2016, Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa, from the Podemos (We Can) party, was both criticised and commended for by taking her baby into parliament and breastfeeding him.

Last year, a report on diversity in UK politics recommended that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons should be considered.

He said he would be willing to visit Pyongyang ""in the right circumstances"".

The 64-year-old human rights lawyer, known for his liberal views, wants to increase contact with North Korea in a departure from current policy.

He has also vowed to unify a divided country reeling from a corruption scandal which saw his predecessor impeached, and improve the economy.

Mr Moon was sworn in as South Korea's 19th president at the National Assembly building in Seoul, filling a leadership vacuum in the wake of Park Geun-hye's removal.

The Democratic Party candidate has positioned himself as the man who can move the country on from the scandal, and has pledged to build ""a just, united country"".

He has also been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development, and has promised to bolster the economy and address youth unemployment, key concerns for voters.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said their countries faced common challenges ""led by responses to the North Korean issue"" but they could ""further contribute to peace and prosperity of the region by working together"".

President Xi Jinping said he ""always attaches great importance to the relationship between China and South Korea"", and that he was ""willing to diligently work with"" with Mr Moon to ensure both countries benefit, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

North Korea had previously hinted that Mr Moon was their preferred candidate, but has yet to issue an official response to his victory.

Final results show Mr Moon took 41.1% of the vote on Tuesday, while conservative candidate Hong Joon-pyo took 25.5%.

Centrist Ahn Cheol-soo, widely seen as a strong contender, came third with 21.4%.",bbc-news
3,Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US special forces have been supporting SDF units on the ground

US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says.

Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.

The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.

Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.

The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.

SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.

The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.

The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.

The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.

Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".

Analysis: Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.

The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.

The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.

US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.

A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.

The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.

No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.

""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""

3,Venezuela sees sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Health care workers protested in February in Caracas against President Nicolas Maduro's government, the lack of medicines and low salaries

There has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in Venezuela.

In the first figures released for two years, the Health Ministry said the number of women dying in childbirth was up by 65%, while child deaths were up 30%.

There has also been a jump in illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria.

The figures reflect the country's deep economic crisis which the opposition says the government has mismanaged.

President Nicolas Maduro says the health crisis is caused by medicines being hoarded to encourage a coup against him.

The country has the largest oil reserves in the world but the collapse of oil prices a few years ago led to a recession and a shortage of the foreign currency needed to import equipment, food and medicines.

Venezuelans face shortages of everything from food to vaccines.

Sorry state of hospitals

UN to supply medicines?

In a recent survey, three-quarters of Venezuelans say their health has plummeted, and that they are eating less than two meals a day. Many report losing an average of around 9 kilos (19 pounds).

In the health sector, large numbers of doctors have emigrated. A leading pharmaceutical association has said around 85% of medicines are in short supply.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a critic of the government's health policies, Dr Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist said:

""The striking part is the turmoil in almost all categories that this bulletin addresses, with particularly significant increased in the infant and maternal health categories.""

Many Venezuelans have trekked to the border with Brazil or Colombia to buy medicine there and seek treatment in public hospitals in neighbouring countries.

In Brazil, the state of Roraima declared a state of emergency to deal with thousands of Venezuelans seeking treatment by the public health service in small border towns.

It is not clear why Venezuela's Health Ministry published its figures now. It had stopped releasing figures after July 2015.

The country has been paralysed for over a month by almost-daily increasingly violent demonstrations against the government of Nicolas Maduro with protestors calling for elections.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect in major Windows 10 news,"Moved temporarily a few months back and physically a few hundred miles north compared to last year, Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference is nearly underway.

With the first keynote set to start on May 10 at 8am PT (11am ET / 4pm BST / 1am May 11 AEST) from Seattle, Washington, Microsoft has plenty to chat about this year despite holding a major media event just last week to tout Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop.

The most notable topics we expect to see detailed are Redstone 3, the codename for Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update, Project Neon, Microsoft’s visual makeover-in-progress for the operating system (OS), Cortana and even more mixed reality advancements.

With that, here is everything we can bank on seeing during the Build 2017 keynotes starting May 10.

Redstone 3 gets unearthed

Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program members are, technically, already testing out Redstone 3 as you read this. We know this because features that were originally slated for Redstone 2, i.e. the Creators Update, but missed the deadline are now in testing through the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 (as of this writing): Build 16188.

Chief among those features left on the Creators Update cutting room floor is My People, a feature that brings your favorite contacts directly into the Windows 10 taskbar for easier file sharing and messaging. Expect to see more of this discussed on stage this week.

Other major expected features to be detailed are PDF editing features in Microsoft Edge (already in the latest Insider Preview build), Power Throttling to reduce apps’ power draw on laptops and tablet PCs and further improvements to more transparent automated OS updates.

We also wouldn’t be surprised to see Redstone 3 get its official name and, at the very least, a release window (if not a hard date) since Microsoft has promised two major updates annually.

Cortana branches out

That Harman Kardon unveiled its Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft’s Cortana just days before Build 2017 is no coincidence. With the long-rumored rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home now out in the open, expect Microsoft to spend some considerable time on this initiative.

In fact, controls for Cortana-powered speakers were already found within the earliest Insider Preview builds for Redstone 3. On that note, expect to hear a lot more about how far the Amazon Alexa-like Cortana Skills and device software developer kits have come since their announcement last year.

However, we find it hard to believe that Microsoft will sit on these tools until Redstone 3 becomes a fancy-named update that hits every Windows 10 device. After all, don’t expect Amazon and Google – or even the rumored Apple Siri Speaker – to slow down over the next five months.

Project Neon ... or Aero Glass 2.0

Microsoft’s fateful fall update should see the oft-teased visual overhaul to the Windows 10 interface known currently as Project Neon.

In short, the new visuals bring back a lot of the translucent design elements found in the Aero Glass design ID that started in Windows Vista and were found throughout Windows 7 before being dropped for Windows 8.

Furthermore, Project Neon markedly changes how Windows 10 animations in transitioning between apps look and feel. That said, early previews have stated that Neon is aiming for a simple aesthetic, so we’ll see how Microsoft achieves that balance with new animations in the mix.

Mixed reality gets a huge push

Unless Microsoft plans to give them a spotlight during its May 23 Surface event, Build 2017 would be the place to show even more of its partners’ head-mounted displays (HMDs).

Having already shown off Acer’s HMD at length during the Taiwanese firm’s annual New York hardware showcase, it’d be surprising not to see already-teased partners like Lenovo, Dell and HP not take the chance to get the word out regarding their Windows 10 Holographic devices.

Bonus round: maybe we’ll finally hear about price regarding any of Microsoft’s partners’ HMD devices. It’s a crucial point going into the holiday season, especially when it’s highly unlikely that either HTC or Facebook have 2017 hardware that can match that $299 starting price.",techradar
10,Amazon Echo Show launched: everything you need to know,"Amazon has finally announced the Amazon Echo Show, the first Echo device equipped with a screen.

The Show follows in the footsteps of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, which combined Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with a camera that can take pictures and offer style recommendations.

The Show is a radical departure from previous Echo devices as it can provide you with information visually (via its screen) as well as through sound; previous speakers were limited to using voice to communicate.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products

The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products How much will it cost? $230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba)

$230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba) When is it out? June 28 and up for pre-order now on Amazon US with no official UK or AU release date yet announced

Amazon Echo Show release date

Confirming what was rumored earlier today due to a leak, Amazon has announced that the Amazon Echo Show will be released on June 28 in both the US and UK, with pre-orders open now in the US.

That means you'll have to wait a month and a half to get your hands on the new speaker if you order it today in the US.

Although the device is rumored to be coming to the UK simultaneously with the US, no official announcement about UK availability has yet been made.

Since Australia is still yet to receive the Amazon Echo, we're not holding our collective breath for the Echo Show to make its way there anytime soon.

Amazon Echo Show features

As well as the Alexa voice assistant, which we've become familiar with thanks to its inclusion in existing Amazon Echo speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon Echo Show is equipped with both a screen and a webcam, which will allow it to both show you, as well as tell you, information.

The screen is seven inches in size, and is touchscreen-enabled. It's capable of showing notifications, playing internet video, and showing lyrics on Amazon Music, among other things, and it can also facilitate conversations between different devices in the same house.

It'll be interesting to see whether this functionality is expanded in the future to enable the Show to make voice calls outside of the home, as a pre-announcement leak from the WSJ suggested.

The screen can also be configured to show a live video feed from elsewhere in the house through compatible third-party security cameras.

In addition to the screen, the Amazon Echo Show is also equipped with a camera, as is the recently announced Amazon Echo Look. Amazon is pitching the Look as a style accessory, which will, for example, analyse your clothes in order to offer outfit suggestions.

This functionality will presumably also be making its way to the new Amazon Echo Show, although this is yet to be confirmed.

The Show is available in black or white color options.

As well as this new screen and camera functionality, the Show is compatible with Amazon's existing library of skills, which range from ordering cabs with Uber to controlling smart lightbulbs and thermostats, although existing skills will be audio-only until they're made Show-compatible.

The Show is equipped with eight microphones, which is one more than the existing Amazon Echo speaker. Given that the existing Echo is already pretty good at picking up our voice we're unsure why an extra microphone is needed, but it's a nice inclusion all the same.

Finally, the new device is equipped with Bluetooth, so even if your music app of choice isn't supported natively (such as Apple Music), you can still stream it to the Echo Show.

Pre-announcement leaks

We first heard rumors of the Amazon Echo Show a couple of months ago when Cnet reported that Amazon was planning on announcing a screen-equipped Echo device.

That report claimed the device, which we now know to be the Amazon Echo Show, was planned for later in the year, but its release was pushed forward after fears that Google Home was progressing more quickly than expected.

Then, just a few days ago, AFTVnews discovered a low-resolution image of the new device, codenamed the Echo 'Knight', on Amazon's servers. When it posted the discovery on Twitter, journalist Evan Blass responded with a much higher-resolution version of the same image.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

This week saw the leak of an announcement date of May 9, followed by a further leak of the price, release date, and name.

Between all of these leaks we've built up a pretty good idea of what the new device should be capable of, and most of the leaks have now been confirmed by the official announcement.",techradar
10,Here's what the OS that could replace* Android and Chrome OS looks like,"Fuchsia, the mysterious new operating system from Google, has taken another step forward, lifting the veil on its user interface.

Screenshots have surfaced showing Fuchsia's UI so far, giving users and programmers alike their first real glance at Google's new OS, as reported by Ars Technica.

Unlike Chrome OS and Android, which are built on Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a Google-made microkernel called Magenta. According to Google programmers, Magenta's focus is on ""modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors.""

Though it's currently just speculation, it's possible that Fuchsia could be the beginning of a new software standard for Google-made products. The search giant is rumored to be trimming the edges on its operating systems, as seen by it bridging some apps between Android and Chrome OS last year.

As for Fuchsia, the new OS uses a current default system UI called Armadillo to build its layout and manage widgets. You can see how it compares visually to its Google-made kin in the images below:

Image 1 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 2 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 3 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica)

From first glance, Fuchsia maintains similar notes to Chrome OS and Android, such as clear-cut widgets and a colorful palette for windows on apps and notifications. Also noticeable are entire sections of the interface dedicated to Google's search functions and suggested content.

However, you can get a better idea what sets Fuchsia apart when it's in motion, a such as in the video below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw of Hotfix.net:

To be clear, Google hasn't stated any plans to actively replace Android or Chrome OS at this time, nor has it given a timeframe for when we might see its experimental new OS make its way to consumer products (if at all.)

That said, as we near ever closer to the Google IO 2017 conference next week, we might be lucky enough to learn more about what the tech giant has planned for its latest creation. In the meantime, the open-source files are available via GitHub for any crafty coders looking to dive into Fuchsia for themselves.

Still quite heavy

Poweradd also offers a great slim portable charger, and it's one of the cheapest options on this list yet boasts a substantial 10,000mAh cell inside.

It may be quite heavy, but this is only 1.3cm thick, making it a great device to slip into your back pocket when you're out and about. You'll want to grab a cable to go with it though as unlike the Iceworks choice above it doesn't come with one built in.

Lepow Portable External Battery Charger

A better design than the rest

Interesting design

Super portable

Takes a while to charge

The best looking device we've chosen is the Lepow portable charger. It comes in a variety of colors and can be easily slipped into your pocket, as it's much smaller than many options on this list.

ZeroLemon ToughJuice Rugged Portable Charger

One you can throw around

Four ports

Surprisingly portable

Not a huge capacity for the price

After a rugged charger that won't break if it takes a beating? The ZeroLemon ToughJuice pack could be a great choice for you, as it comes with a solid design that isn't too large to slip into your bag or even your back pocket.

It also features four USB ports, so you're able to charge a number of devices all at the same time.

Best portable chargers for laptops and phones

RAVPower Universal Power Bank Travel Charger

One for your laptop

The picture above may be deceptive, as this isn't a small charger and is capable of charging up your laptop or tablet as well as your phone simultaneously.

You can charge up to three devices at the same time and it comes with a 23,000mAh capacity, so it should last long enough between recharges.

Bestek Car Jump Starter

Something different

Huge capacity

Can jump start a car

Not very portable

The largest charger in this category (in terms of size, though not capacity) is also one of the most innovative, as this one can even jump start your car.

It features a huge 13,600mAh battery that can give your car that much needed jolt whenever you need it to, but also comes with various ports for your phone or laptop to charge as well.",techradar
10,Has Meizu's quick charge tech reinvented the smartphone?,"Do you carry a portable charger for your smartphone? They seem innocent enough, but those small black boxes are like a sticking plaster over the tech industry's gaping wound; pathetic phone batteries not fit for the modern mobile age.

It's not just the Pokémon Go app that drains the life from smartphones, with navigation apps like Google Maps, firmware updates, and even just the camera app eating away at battery life at a worrying rate.

So could a claim by Chinese phone maker Meizu that it now has the technology to recharge a phone in less than 20 minutes change everything?

Super mCharge is expected to be used in phones inside two years. © Jamie Carter

Short battery life is a huge problem for the phone industry, whose minor improvements in power efficiency have been swallowed up by the ever-increasing size of smartphone screens.

""Smartphones have become more power-hungry, and battery life and charging technology has failed to keep pace, leaving users often unsatisfied with the battery life of their devices,"" says James Manning Smith, Information Analyst at Futuresource Consulting.

He points out that manufacturers have three choices when designing a phone; larger batteries in devices, more efficient components, and making charging more convenient for users.

Meizu has taken the middle road with its Super mCharge technology, which it unveiled at a press event at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The live demo saw an empty smartphone fill-up in precisely 18 minutes and 55 seconds.

Not exactly a riveting watch for onlookers, but impressive nonetheless. After over a year of R&D, said Meizu, it had improved the power of a Super mCharge battery to 55W, and accelerated charging speed by 5.5 times.

© Jamie Carter

An industry first

That 55W figure is key. “Meizu's 55W charging is a first for the mobile industry,” says Manning Smith, who confirms that it's a more powerful charging solution than anything already on the market.

“Standard USB charging is 5W, while some OEMs have released phones with 15-18W charging, such as Motorola, Samsung and Oppo.”

The battery inside the Meizu demo phone was 3,000mAh, which is a typical size for a smartphone (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses a 3,000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 claims a 1,960mAh battery), though this one was specially designed by Meizu's engineers to bear more than four times the current so it could work with Super mCharge.

So what has Meizu actually achieved here? As well as taking charging to 55W, Meizu has dramatically accelerated the charging speed.

Technically speaking, Super mCharge uses charge pump technology; comprising two groups of circuits, the charge pump exports half of the voltage after transformation and improves efficiency by 8%.

""Our solution yields 98% efficiency, compared with other companies who struggle to hit 90%,"" claims Meizu.

Super mCharge also uses a USB cable that's been redesigned to carry up to 160W of power, and as a result it does cost three times more than a regular USB cable.

© Jamie Carter

Can the Meizu phone stand the heat?

There are two immediate concerns. Firstly, does fast charging mean the battery won't last very long? Secondly, is all that extra heat generated safe? After all, exploding batteries in smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have made us all nervous.

On the first question, Meizu insists that in tests its 3,000mAh battery retained more than 80 percent of its capacity after 800 charge and discharge cycles, so it should be good for two years' normal use.

On the second concern about safety, Meizu claims that its optimization algorithm means the highest temperature the battery reaches is 39°C/102°F (in an ambient temperature of 22°C/72°F), just a bit higher than body temperature.

Manning Smith explains that since smartphones are very condensed devices, engineering restrictions mean the heat that builds up during high-powered charging can damage the battery, and other components in the phone.

""Meizu has developed a technology that allows the battery to be charged at a very high rate, without exceeding dangerous temperature levels,"" he adds.

Quick Charge 4.0 features on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. © Jamie Carter

This is all impressive stuff, but only if the device can live up to Meizu's promises. ""Once the technology comes to market, it has the potential to set a new standard for wired smartphone charging,"" says Manning Smith.

That should happen during 2019 or 2020, but there's no guaranteed success for Super mCharge. Not only are several other similar innovations expected in that time-frame, but the general trend towards super-fast wired charging for phones looks set to be overtaken by the wireless charging era.

When it comes to super-fast wired charging, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 (QC3.0) for Android devices is the current front-runner, with QC4.0 just announced for new flagship Android phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset – and that includes the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, ZTE Gigabit and some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

QC4.0 claims to charge 20% faster than QC3.0 (which charges an empty phone to 50% in about 30 minutes). That's not as impressive as Super mCharge's promised speeds, but then again it's available already.

Can Meizu's technology compete with wireless pads?

""Wireless charging companies are trying to [create] a world in which charging cables are unnecessary,"" says Manning Smith, who admits that support for wireless charging pads in wider society is in its infancy.

However, Aircharge has been installing wireless charging stations in restaurants, airports and hotels, while IKEA is including wireless charging pads in some furniture.

""Should we see an increase in the availability of wireless charging outlets in our daily lives, there may be less need for fast charging technologies,"" Manning Smith says.

There are also efforts to develop high-wattage wireless charging. Bosch has wireless charging for power tools that it plans to take up to 60W and use in all kinds of mobile devices by 2020, which would surpass Meizu's achievement – while LG has been developing wireless charging pads that bring a fully discharged phone up to 50% in 30 minutes, (so on a par with QC3.0).

“The convenience of cable-free, little-and-often charges that wireless charging can provide may be more convincing for consumers than wired, but quick charging,” says Manning Smith.

So while Meizu's Super mCharge is an exciting achievement, the future belongs not to electrochemical cells, but wireless charging pads – probably starting with your car.",techradar

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Just last week, President Trump was on Twitter accusing FBI Director James Comey of being too soft on his election opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" Trump tweeted May 2.

A week later, Trump sacked Comey — but for the exact opposite reason. Moments after announcing Comey's firing, the White House released a Justice Department letter that claimed Comey had inappropriately disparaged Clinton during the election campaign — and overstepped his bounds in publicly disclosing that he had reopened his investigation into the former secretary of State's emails.

Only Trump knows the real reason for Comey's firing.

But in his letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, Trump issued what appeared a Shakespearean protestation: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote to Comey on Tuesday.

Indeed, Comey was leading what appeared to be an open-ended investigation into Russian interference in the election — and what Trump associates knew about it. ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Comey's firing will have the immediate effect of intensifying calls for an independent investigation to probe that very question.

After all, Comey was thrust into the role of refereeing the 2016 election because political appointees in the Obama and Trump administrations had been seen as incapable of doing so.

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch was forced to recuse herself from the Clinton probe after an ill-considered meeting with former president Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix in the midst of the investigation into his wife's emails.

Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, was fired 10 days into the Trump administration — four days after she warned the White House that Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was susceptible to Russian blackmail.

And Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also had to recuse himself after misleading Congress about his own contacts with the Russian government while he served as a high-profile supporter of Trump's campaign.

So the political maelstrom Comey found himself in wasn't entirely of his own making. Still, Comey did not shun the spotlight that came with those politically sensitive investigations, holding unusually expository press conferences and giving freewheeling congressional testimony.

If there were any doubt that Comey was a pivotal figure in the 2016 presidential election, his firing as FBI director Tuesday should settle the issue for the history books.

It's a history that is still being written.

WASHINGTON – James Comey was supposed to have at least six more years in his term as FBI director.

Now that he’s been abruptly fired by President Trump, the White House has launched a search to replace him.

Who could take his place? Neither the FBI nor Justice Department would provide any leads. But there could be some clues.

Four years ago, when then-President Barack Obama selected Comey to succeed Robert Mueller, his name came from a list of potential candidates who may now have a new chance at the office.

The most-discussed names in that pool included some of most familiar names in national law enforcement, along with a former member of Congress.

Before Comey’s selection was announced in 2013, former Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, was the favorite of the FBI Agents Association, a group of 13,000 current and former agents.

""Chairman Rogers exemplifies the principles that should be possessed by the next FBI director,"" then-FBIAA President Konrad Motyka said at the time, announcing the association's support for Rogers. ""His unique and diverse experience as a veteran FBI agent and member of Congress will allow him to effectively lead the men and women of the bureau as they continue their work to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats.""

Ken Wainstein, a former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, was another favorite.

Earlier this week, Wainstein made a public appearance, even though he stayed off to the sidelines. He served as counsel to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a Monday appearance before a Senate subcommittee exploring Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Previously, he served as the FBI's general counsel and Mueller's chief of staff at the bureau.

At the Justice Department, Wainstein also once served as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., and the director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, where he oversaw the operations of 94 federal prosecutors' offices in the U.S.

Another potential pick: John Pistole. Before his appointment as president of Anderson University in Indiana three years ago, the former deputy director of the FBI, had won notice for his steady direction of the Transportation Security Administration.

Pistole also is a close friend of Comey who attended the former TSA director's induction as Anderson University president.

Some current and former FBI agents also have pointed to Michael Mason, a former executive assistant FBI director, as a candidate for the top job.

Before leaving the bureau, Mason oversaw criminal and cyber investigations, coordinated international operations and the bureau's crisis response operations.

Two former New York officials were also linked to previous discussions about top jobs at the bureau and the Justice Department: former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Giuliani, a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign, had been considered for a number of positions in the new administration, including attorney general and secretary of State. Meanwhile, Kelly is an executive at a private security firm.

As the search continues, the FBI is being headed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

But McCabe, who helped oversee the bureau's contentious investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, also has drawn heat.

McCabe's wife, a candidate for state office in Virginia, was the recipient of nearly $500,000 raised by an organization linked to Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The FBI claimed that the deputy director played no role in the campaign.

What does it say about your presidency when Richard Nixon's presidential library is mocking you?

""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian,"" the library tweeted Tuesday within a couple hours of the announcement of President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey.

FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector#notNixonianpic.twitter.com/PatArKOZlk — RichardNixonLibrary (@NixonLibrary) May 9, 2017

It's true that Nixon never fired a FBI director. That honor goes to Bill Clinton, who was the first (and up until Tuesday, the only) president to fire a FBI director. Back in 1993, Clinton fired William Sessions over ethical concerns. Sessions had refused to step down voluntarily.

Still, #Nixonian was trending Tuesday night after Comey's firing. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon made a controversial move when he ordered the firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor charged with the investigation into the Watergate scandal. That led to the resignations of his attorney general, Elliott Richardson, and his deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus.

WASHINGTON — President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in the middle of several investigations of possible Trump campaign ties to last year’s Russian meddling in U.S. elections caused a firestorm of protest from Democratic members of Congress, with many calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Some equated the firing with events known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told Trump that he had made a “big mistake” when informed of the decision.

Schumer wondered aloud whether the firing meant Comey’s investigation was “getting too close to home,” and he said the handling of a credible investigation depends on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein naming a “fearless, independent” special prosecutor.

“Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,"" Schumer said.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for the creation of a special congressional committee on Russia, while Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he and his staff were ""reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.""

""James Comey is a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" McCain said.

Comey, a Republican who had served in the George W. Bush administration as second in command in the Justice Department, was the surprise choice of President Barack Obama for the FBI post.

He had established his independence in March 2004 when then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales sought to get Comey’s boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to sign off on a secret National Security Agency wiretap program. Ashcroft, seriously ill in the hospital with pancreatitis, had turned his duties over to Comey, who told Gonzales in Ashcroft’s hospital room that he refused to authorize the program.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the troubled House intelligence committee, said the firing raised profound questions about White House interference in a criminal probe.

“The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff said, likening the event to the Watergate firings.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Trump’s action poses serious constitutional issues, while others called the development “Nixonian.”

“The termination and removal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises the critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last presidential campaign will continue,” Durbin said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate committee probing the Trump-Russia connection, called the firing “outrageous.”

“I have been long been a critic of Director Comey ... but Donald Trump’s decision to fire him now, in the midst of an investigation into Trump associates and their ties to Russia, is outrageous,"" Wyden said. He said Comey should be called to testify before Congress about the status of the Trump-Russia investigation.

“The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who questioned Comey at a hearing before a Judiciary subcommittee this week, said the way Trump is handling the firing “is shocking.”

“No one should accept President Trump’s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly,” Leahy said. “The president has removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country. This is nothing less than Nixonian.”

Leahy also noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president consulted before the firing, was supposed to have recused himself. He said Rosenstein now has no choice but to appoint a special counsel.

A long list of others calling for an independent probe included Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Ben Cardin, D-Md., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., along with good government advocacy groups MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

Others reacted with more measured tones. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said simply that she had been informed by the president of his decision by phone, adding, “the next FBI director must be strong and independent and will receive a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee.”

One of the earliest Republican reactions came from Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: “While the case for removal of (FBI Director Comey) laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

News of Comey’s departure came near the end of an hourlong telephone town hall meeting that House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., was having with constituents. “Lisa in Mendham” said she wanted to know what Congress was going to do now to hold Trump accountable “for his potentially breaking the law in dealing with Russia.”

Frelinghuysen didn’t answer that question directly but gave a positive appraisal of the job Comey has done.

“He had the reputation ... like his predecessor Robert Muller, of being a sort of straight-arrow guy,” Frelinghuysen said. “I do think he was an honorable man and represented an amazing department. I'm surprised he's gone. But in this business, I guess nothing is too surprising.”

Reporters Herb Jackson and Eliza Collins contributed to this story.

WASHINGTON — After railing against FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, Democrats aligned with her presidential campaign reacted to his firing not with satisfaction — but with deep suspicion.

Among the former Clinton officials weighing in was her campaign manager Robby Mook. Despite frustration and disappointment over the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation, the announcement “terrifies me,” said Mook.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

Brian Fallon, who was a top communications official during the campaign, said he’s “not shedding any tears for Comey,” even as his firing makes him “worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now.”

I'm not shedding any tears for Comey personally -he hurt FBI's reputation- but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) May 9, 2017

In a letter to Comey, Trump cited as cause for the FBI director’s firing his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, including public statements he made leading up to the presidential election. Yet Comey’s judgment over the email investigation has been an issue for several months. As recently as late January, Trump was seen patting Comey on the back during a White House reception to honor law enforcement officers.

What’s new is that Comey’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials is heating up, including whether there is any evidence of collusion between the two as Russia sought to bolster Trump’s campaign and hurt Clinton’s, according to numerous U.S. intelligence agencies.

The firing also comes days after Comey testified before Congress about his handling of the email investigation during which he mistakenly stated that the FBI had obtained thousands of new emails from a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. While the FBI later corrected the misstatement, it appears to have given the White House an opening to fire the FBI director.

Comey came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats throughout the course of the Clinton investigation. It was days before the Nov. 8, 2016, election that Comey announced his team had found additional emails on the laptop of her aide, Huma Abedin, which the Clinton campaign blames for depressing votes in critical battlegrounds that Clinton lost to Trump by a small margin. During the hearing, Comey said he was “mildly nauseous” if his actions had any effect on the presidential election, while insisting he had no choice but to inform the public about the emails.

They also faulted Comey for speaking out about the investigation in July, when he explain why he decided against bringing charges against Clinton.

It was a break with normal FBI protocol, yet Comey may have felt pressure to speak out after former President Bill Clinton drew criticism for boarding the plane and having a private conversation with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

WASHINGTON — White House officials say President Trump based his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday on the ""clear recommendations"" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a memo released Tuesday evening, Rosenstein sharply criticized the FBI chief, saying he mishandled the final stages of investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's treatment of classified State Department emails. The firing was needed to restore public confidence in the agency, Rosenstein concluded.

At the heart of the criticism: Comey's various public pronouncements about the investigation during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. On July 5, Comey held a news conference in which he said no charges would be filed against Clinton. But on Oct 28, Comey announced that the probe had been reopened to examine newly discovered emails. Then, two days before before election, Comey once again weighed in, saying the department still was not recommending charges against the former secretary of State.

Here are key points in Rosenstein's memo:

1. ""The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.""

2. ""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unifies people of diverse perspectives.""

3. ""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.""

4. ""Compounding the error: The director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

5. ""Although the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.""

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Danny Green scored seven of his 16 points in overtime, and the San Antonio Spurs overcame an injury to Kawhi Leonard to beat James Harden and the Houston Rockets 110-107 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their second-playoff series.

Leonard had 22 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes before exiting with an injured right ankle. Leonard stepped on Harden's foot with 5:37 left in the third quarter and then played limited minutes before sitting out overtime.

Harden had 33 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He had a chance at potential tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of OT, but was blocked from behind by Manu Ginobili.

""I know where his shot release is from,"" Ginobili said. ""I tried to bother him as much as I could. It was a risky play, but it was also risky to let him shoot.""

MANU. SEALED IT.#NBAPlayoffspic.twitter.com/0ewMHivxYY — NBA.com (@NBAcom) May 10, 2017

Aside from the block, Ginobili had 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists off the bench in the win. He also had a surprising dunk that he described as ""unexpected.""

""Manu reached back and gave us one of his Manu performances from past years,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He was a stud.""

Game 6 is Thursday in Houston.

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

Each team stalled at the start of the extra period. Patrick Beverley made a 3-pointer with 2 minutes remaining for the first points of the period, giving Houston a 104-101 lead.

Green made a go-ahead 3-pointer and converted a three-point play to make it 109-107 Spurs with 30.1 seconds left. He also made a foul shot down the stretch to help San Antonio hold on.

""The competitiveness was off the charts,"" Popovich said. ""Either team could've won the game down the stretch.""

Two questionable plays closed regulation with the game tied at 101.

Harden was whistled for a charge after dribbling all but a few seconds off the shot clock before driving to the basket on Jonathon Simmons. The Spurs failed to take a shot on their final possession, with Patty Mills banking in a 3-pointer after the buzzer sounded.

""We let one slip away,"" Harden said. ""Execution, rebounding. Two primary things we let slip away.""

Harden also played solid defense, helping hold Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge to 15-for-42 shooting as he rotated assignments in Houston's smaller lineup. But he finished with nine turnovers.

With the Rockets leading 82-81, officials ruled a ball out of bounds on the Spurs that replays showed was actually off Harden. Beverley drained a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession, prompting San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich to scream and point at official Derrick Stafford.

The play ignited what had been a rather listless San Antonio, leading to a 10-2 run bridging the third and fourth quarters for a 92-87 lead.

The Spurs tried to exploit a size advantage over the Rockets' small lineup early, especially when Harden was guarding either Aldridge and Pau Gasol. The Spurs' big men only managed 2-for-5 shooting in the opening three minutes, leading San Antonio to abandon the strategy midway through the first quarter and sub Simmons for Gasol.

Simmons responded by scoring 10 points on 5-for-13 shooting in 26 minutes.

6,President Trump fires FBI Director James Comey,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump fired the Director of the FBI. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has that story. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned the political world by firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, an abrupt ending to a tenure marked by political controversies ranging from the Trump campaign's connections to Russia to Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails.

Basing his decision on the recommendations from both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump said in a statement that ""the FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.""

The search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, the White house said.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. In a letter to Comey released by the White House, Trump agreed he ""was not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

Yet Comey's sudden dismissal calls into question the future of the investigation into Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election. The FBI is currently in the midst of a full-blown counterintelligence inquiry, exploring charges of possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

Democrats — including some who had previously attacked Comey for his handling of the Clinton probe — saw Trump's move as a blatant attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a reference to President Richard Nixon's decision in 1973 to remove the Watergate special prosecutor.

And Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's decision to fire the man overseeing a federal investigation into his campaign associates' collusion with Russia ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter.""

Schiff, whose panel is conducting a separate investigation into Russia's influence on the presidential election, called for an independent prosecutor ""to restore a modicum of public confidence — now completely lacking — that the criminal investigation will continue without further interference by the White House.""

If Trump were truly upset with Comey about his handling of the Clinton probe, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, he could have fired Comey on his first day in office. Instead, the Senate's top Democrat said, the president waited until Congress and FBI investigations into Russia heated up.

""Given the way the President has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration,"" Schumer said. Without an independent special prosecutor, he added, ""every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.""

For his part, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Trump's actions ""threaten"" the critical investigations now underway ""and the integrity and independence of the FBI.""

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

In his termination letter, Trump referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation, telling Comey he appreciated him ""informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

Still, the concern about the timing of Comey's firing was not limited to Democrats.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is leading the Senate panel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, said he was “troubled’’ by both the timing and reasons for Comey’s dismissal. ""I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee,’’ Burr said. “In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our committee.

“Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees,"" he continued. ""His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.”

A career prosecutor, Comey, held top Justice Department posts in the George W. Bush administration before being appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

He is only the second director fired in the 82-year history of the FBI. President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions in 1993 amid ethics problems. While FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms in order to make them nominally non-partisan, they can still be fired by the president.

As news of Comey's dismissal raced through Washington on Tuesday night, Republicans defended the move as difficult but necessary.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's ""decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.""

Meanwhile, Comey was apparently finding out his own employment status in an unconventional way.

Comey left Washington earlier Tuesday for a speaking engagement, and was not informed of his firing until he saw news reports of it on television while at the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, a person familiar with the matter said.

The abrupt firing came just after the FBI confirmed Comey provided erroneous testimony to a Senate panel about how Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin handled classified emails.

Notably, some of the same Democrats upset about Comey's firing have also previously called for his head, blaming Clinton's loss of the presidency on Comey's unexpected public announcement on Oct. 28 that he was re-opening the investigation into her emails.

Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate two weeks ago as Comey's day-to-day supervisor, also faulted Comey for announcing he had re-opened the case 11 days before the election — and for his earlier July 5 news conference saying no charges would be filed against Clinton.

In a memo to the attorney general, Rosenstein said he did not understand Comey's refusal to acknowledge fault with his actions.

""Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of different perspectives,"" Rosenstein wrote.

Late Tuesday, Attorney General Sessions sent a message to the entire FBI, saying that Trump had “exercised his lawful authority to remove’’ Comey.

“By operation of law and effective immediately, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe assumed the position of acting director of the FBI,’’ Sessions wrote. “As you well know, the FBI is an exceptional law enforcement agency. It is made by you, the devoted men and women who work tirelessly to keep our country safe. Thank you for your steadfast dedication and commitment during this time of transition.’’

James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired

Meanwhile, as Comey remains the target of public criticism over his handling of the Clinton case, the Justice Department’s inspector general is in the midst of wide-ranging review of Justice’s handling of the matter, including Comey’s leadership of it.

Last week, Comey disclosed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been interviewed by Justice investigators assigned to the case and expected to be questioned again.

“I have a story to tell,’’ Comey told the panel.

Comey, 56, succeeded Robert Mueller, the longest serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller served for 12 years before leaving the bureau.

A former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan and former deputy attorney general, Comey won plaudits for his independence as a key player in one of the most dramatic moments during the George W. Bush administration.

With then-Attorney General John Ashcroft hospitalized in 2004 with acute pancreatitis, Deputy Attorney General Comey rushed to his boss’ bedside at George Washington Hospital when he learned that then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andrew Card were trying to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize a controversial warrantless eavesdropping program.

Since taking office, Comey has staked out the highest profile of any director since Hoover.

In any venue, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey is hard to miss. Often referring to himself as an “awkward white guy,’’ he was anything but while delivering testimony before Congress engaging audiences in public and private forums.

Even in high-stakes congressional hearings, Comey often operated without written text and rarely sought advice from aides who accompanied him.

His public and controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was only the latest in a string of public positions that the director took that did not always sit well with the White House and the Justice Department — including under Obama's administration.

He bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with the racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and in Birmingham, Ala., and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country—a position that put him at odds with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Obama White House.

He drew the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates last year as the face of the government’s legal battle with Apple Inc., to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. With Apple insisting that creating a way to break into the device's default encryption would be tantamount to giving the FBI a ""backdoor"" that could be used to break into Apple products again and again, Comey described the dispute as the “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’

At another point, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of battling homegrown violent extremists, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred communities across the country, from Garland, Texas to Orlando, Fla. His public concern about the FBI's capacity to confront the growing homegrown threat, prompted lawmakers to question whether the bureau had the resources to deal with it.

As the White House searches for a replacement, FBI Agents Association President Thomas O’Connor called on the Trump administration to proceed with “caution.""

“A change in FBI leadership of this magnitude must be handled carefully and with an eye towards ensuring that the bureau can continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American public from criminal and national security threats,’’ O’Connor said.

“We greatly appreciate Director Comey’s service, leadership, and support for special agents during his tenure. He understood the centrality of the agent to the bureau's mission, recognizing that agents put their lives on the line every day. His focus was to ensure that the bureau’s investigations complied with the law and the constitution, and that agents performed their mission with integrity and professionalism. As vital stakeholders, FBI agents should be given a voice in the process of selecting the next director.”

16,What's up with Melania Trump's cyber bullying campaign? It's 'a work in progress',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a rare campaign speech, Melania Trump said that one of her key issues as First Lady would be to combat cyber bullying Time

Melania Trump, America's historic first lady, pledged before the election that she would lead a campaign against cyber bullying.

But so far, say leaders and activists in anti-cyber bullying efforts, neither Trump nor her East Wing staff have reached out, nor have they responded to offers to help.

""I'm not seeing any movement towards an initiative that she's endorsed,"" says first lady historian Myra Gutin of Rider University in New Jersey. ""She's hired some staff but not up to the level that other first ladies have done by now.""

Trump's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, says the anti-cyber bullying effort is still a work in progress. ""Mrs. Trump is being very thoughtful when it comes to building out her initiatives,"" Grisham said in an email. Also, her staff now numbers 10, and she's taking her time hiring because she values ""quality over quantity.""

Trump herself declined to comment, as she has routinely since she became first lady. But on Nov. 3, 2016, she attracted widespread attention when she announced in a rare speech that she would fight cyber bullying as her first-lady cause if her husband, Donald Trump, were elected.

“Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side,"" she told an audience of suburban women in Berwyn, Pa. ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”

Her declaration brought out plenty of ire on social media from those who consider Donald Trump the definition of a cyber bully given his aggressive social media attacks against anyone who piques his fury.

Lady Gaga, whose Born This Way Foundation aims to combat bullying, especially of LGBT kids, was scathing, though Gaga's representative did not return a message from USA TODAY seeking comment on how she feels about Melania Trump now.

.@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016

But there was no mocking from other anti-cyber bullying activists, who say they remain patient and hopeful that Trump will launch her initiative soon.

""We have tried to reach out to her and offer the services and expertise of our organization; so far, we have not heard back,"" says Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York. Still, ""I’m delighted that Melania Trump chose cyber bullying. I think she could do a tremendous amount for the children and adolescents who are suffering as a result of it.""

Since the election, excited activists have been sending Trump advice and proposals, such as holding an annual online safety summit at the White House, says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.

""We haven’t heard anything from FLOTUS at all (so) I’m not in a position to speak to what she is or is not doing since we’re not connected yet,"" says Hinduja.

He says ""everyone in my line of work has been buzzing"" since Trump's speech. He says ""good progress"" has been made on cyber bullying over the last eight years by the White House, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education.

""And we’re just hoping that there will be continued and even increased support and contributions from the highest office in the land,"" he says. ""That is tremendously exciting for all of us.""

The Family Online Safety Institute welcomed Trump to the cause in December, issuing a set of recommendations such as: Inaugurating an annual Online Safety Summit at the White House; creating a chief online safety officer; and persuading the new administration to set up a $25 million research-and-education fund over five years to create educational programs for children and their parents on cyber bullying and online safety in general.

""We are still waiting to hear from her or her office about how she wishes to take this topic on,"" says Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Washington-based group. ""The only indication we’ve had is that speech before the election. And then, of course, she has mostly remained in New York. So there's not been a great deal of movement yet.

""But of those I've spoken to, including in my own organization, we’re cautiously optimistic.""

Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, says she's not been contacted by Trump's team. ""It’s such important work and there’s a huge need for creating kinder and supportive online and offline spaces, so I hope FLOTUS decides to engage in this important work,"" she says.

Donna Rice Hughes, a key figure in a 1987 political scandal that ended a Democratic presidential campaign, has been a respected leader on Internet safety for kids for more than two decades through her Enough is Enough non-profit. She endorsed Donald Trump and though she hasn't heard yet from Melania, she is convinced it will happen and that mothers especially will relate to the new FLOTUS.

""She is modeling what it means to have a balanced life and the difficulty most women who have families are having in trying to keep that all in balance,"" says Hughes. ""I am not at all concerned or surprised she's taking some time. It's very clear right now her priority is her son. She’s got four years minimum, maybe eight, to deal with cyber bullying.""

Could President Trump's online blasts undermine the first lady's cause? Possibly, says Balkam, but it would depend on the specifics of her initiative. If she focuses on, say, child-on-child cyber bullying, ""it's possible nothing he does undermines what she tries to do. But let’s wait and see.""

Combating digital bullying is not a new cause nor an inconsequential one, according to the experts and activists who have been laboring in relative obscurity for years, concerned about analysis (from the Cyberbullying Research Center in Orlando, for instance) showing that two-thirds of students who experience cyber bullying say it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school.

Monica Lewinsky has been a recent high-profile voice on the issue: She called for an end to the ""culture of humiliation"" in a powerful TED talk in 2015. ""Cruelty is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible,"" she said then. ""Millions of people can stab you with their words and that's a lot of pain.""

She would seem to be a perfect ally to Melania Trump — and in fact, she defended the Trumps' young son, Barron, after he was mocked online — but her spokeswoman, Dini von Mueffling, confirmed to USA TODAY that so far Lewinsky has not heard from Trump.

all children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl #barrontrump). let's be better than this. https://t.co/CH3IfdpQpu — Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) January 23, 2017

But nothing beats a first lady's spotlight for focusing attention. So far, Trump has said nothing about cyber bullying in public, except on April 26, when she celebrated her 47th birthday at a lunch for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Grisham confirmed Trump mentioned cyber bullying at the lunch, thanking the group for a donation they made in her name to an anti-bullying organization, which is the tradition of the Senate spouses group for every incoming new first lady. But the lunch was closed to the media at the behest of the group so there's no official transcript.

Soon after the election, Donald Trump said his third wife would not move into the White House immediately after the inauguration; instead, she would remain in New York so that Barron, 11, could finish the school year.

Grisham maintains she's still been ""100% present"" as first lady since Jan. 20, and anyway nowadays people can work remotely from anywhere.

For comparison, Michelle Obama also said her first priority would be her children when she became first lady in 2009, though she immediately was visible and active. She did not fully launch her first initiative, her campaign for healthy eating and against childhood obesity, until nine months after she came to the White House.

""With Mrs. Trump, who's not living here yet and who's just starting to assemble her team, it may take a little longer to roll out her first initiative, but it will be done with a level of full knowledge, research and careful attention to the important data out there on this issue,"" predicts Anita McBride, who worked in multiple administrations, was former first lady Laura Bush's chief of staff and now studies the legacies of first ladies at American University in Washington.

But her absence has been noticed: Stylish and statuesque, the ex-model stands out when she is present, stimulating further curiosity about her. But she remains largely inscrutable; unlike her polished stepdaughter, businesswoman-turned-White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, Melania has not done media interviews about her plans.

Does it matter that Trump has been a slow-starting FLOTUS?

Every new first lady takes a different approach, says McBride, and it's nothing to worry about. ""We may have to get used to, with this new first lady, she's not going to do it the way her predecessors did it; she's going to do it the way it fits her best. That may be more limited but it will be just as impactful.""

First-lady expert Kate Andersen

Brower,

author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,

says she's sympathetic to the notion that Trump needs more time to understand the job. ""While they get a honeymoon period, I think that's quickly coming to an end,"" Andersen Brower says.

Gutin suspects most people don't care, but she thinks Trump is missing an opportunity.

""The tradition is that the presidential spouse gives us some insight into the character of the president, and certainly since Jacqueline Kennedy those of us who care about it have always thought the first lady can use (the White House audience) to do a lot of good,"" Gutin says. ""Does it matter to the success of an administration? Probably not. But there is the opportunity there and she's not taking advantage of it.""

Or not yet, anyway.

And they did it with their best player in Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entire overtime session.

Leonard suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury earlier in the game, and tried his best to play through it. But once it became clear that he couldn’t go, Gregg Popovich made the difficult decision to bench him down the stretch. Thanks to huge plays from Danny Green and Manu Ginobili — along with some brutal offensive possessions from James Harden and the Rockets, especially in overtime — San Antonio was able to win in spite of Leonard’s absence.

But the Spurs received some good news after the game. Leonard, who was walking with a pronounced limp, told reporters he won’t miss Game 6 on Thursday in Houston.

Leonard naturally struggled for most of the second half following the injury, finishing with 22 points on 8-for-21 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and four assists.

The question now for the Spurs is how limited Leonard might be in what could be a close-out Game 6. Even before the Leonard injury, San Antonio reverted to its switch-heavy defense, rather than having its franchise player try to lock down Harden for most of the night.

If Leonard isn’t 100 percent on Thursday, it stands to reason the Spurs would use a similar defensive tactic, encouraging Harden to attack mismatches in isolation instead of running the typical Houston offense.

Rivera (20-1) has been flawless thus far in his UFC career with four consecutive wins including a victory over new UFC Hall of Fame inductee Urijah Faber this past September.

Rivera has been clamoring for a big fight as he continues his climb up the bantamweight rankings and now he’ll face one of the most dangerous threats the divison has to offer.

Almeida (22-1) has been one of the most thrilling fighters competing at 135 pounds since his arrival in the UFC nearly three years ago.

9,Dana White: 'There's going to be a point where I'm done' pursuing McGregor vs. Mayweather | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White committed to doing everything possible to land Conor McGregor a lucrative payday against Floyd Mayweather, but the fight is still no closer to reality.

On Saturday night after Saul “Canelo” Alvarez dished out a punishing decision in his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., his next bout against Gennady Golovkin was announced for September 16.

That was the date originally reserved for the proposed matchup between McGregor and Mayweather, but White says he just wasn’t able to strike a deal with both sides in time so a different boxing match scooped up that Saturday on the schedule.

“The reason they got my date is because I couldn’t get my deal done on time so they got the date,” White told “The Herd” on Tuesday. “Listen, life moves on, we don’t wait for anybody. The fights are going to keep rolling. I didn’t get the deal done fast enough so I lose the date. That’s how it works.”

A date being targeted for the fight might make it appear that a deal is imminent but White says that couldn’t be further from the truth.

In fact, he says he’s no closer to closing the negotiations to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather and there will come a day when he is forced to give up if the two sides can’t reach an amicable agreement.

“I’m not hinting that it’s getting close at all. I knew that this thing was going to be a nightmare to get done if it can even be done. We’ll find out,” White said. “Obviously, both guys want to fight each other but what’s the deal. Can the deal be done? That’s the question.

“It’s not just Mayweather. It’s both sides of this thing are going to be hard to get done. Absolutely, there’s going to be a point where I’m done. This isn’t what I do, this isn’t my business and I’m definitely going to walk away.”

White can’t say for certain when that deadline will be reached where he’ll no longer participate in the negotiations, but he promises it could eventually happen.

As much as he wants to put the fight together for McGregor, who stands to potentially make up to nine-figures for the bout, White will eventually reach his breaking point.

“Either way, it doesn’t matter to me. I know that these two guys want to fight. I’ve said many times, I respect Conor and I’d like to do this fight for him but it’s got to be the right deal. We have to get the right deal done or it’s not going to happen,” White said. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t what I do. The UFC is what I do and I should be focusing on that and not a boxing match.

“Obviously, a lot of people want to see it, there’s a lot of interest in it, but it’s not really what I do.”",fox-sports

9,UFC finally confirms women's flyweight division launching with 'Ultimate Fighter' 26 | FOX Sports,"Let’s try this one more time.

Last week the UFC announced and then retracted plans to launch a women’s flyweight division with season 26 on “The Ultimate Fighter” with filming expected to start in July.

Now the UFC has finally rolled out the plan — again — to kick off the 125-pound women’s division with the new season of the reality show where fighters from outside the UFC as well as competitors currently on the roster can try out for the season that will crown the first ever champion.

Tryouts will be held on May 23 at the Palace Station Hotel in Las Vegas. Fighters are required to be between the ages of 21-34 with at least three fights and a winning professional record.

The stutter step for the announcement didn’t slow down the excitement for several fighters already competing in the UFC, who have already expressed interest in moving to flyweight once the division opens.

Jessica Eye, who was previously ranked as the No. 1 fighter in the world at flyweight, has already told FOX Sports that if she wins her next bout on July 7 against Aspen Ladd that she plans to move down to 125 pounds.

Former “Ultimate Fighter” competitor Bec Rawlings has also mentioned a potential move to flyweight although it doesn’t appear she’s interested in competing during another season of the reality show after already doing that once previously in her career.

Lauren Murphy has stated that she plans on gunning for a spot on the reality show with an aim to become the first ever women’s flyweight champion in the UFC.

6,Behind the scenes of James Comey's epic firing,"Washington (CNN) A little past 5 p.m. on Tuesday, a black Ford Taurus slowed to a stop just outside FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatched a white-haired man in a dark suit.

He emerged from the car alone, a manila folder in his right hand, and walked slowly toward the agency's appointment gate. Passersby paid little notice.

But Keith Schiller, President Donald Trump's pugnacious former bodyguard who now sits sentry outside the Oval Office doors, was at the law enforcement agency armed with a bombshell message from his longtime boss to FBI Director James Comey: ""You are hereby terminated and removed from office.""

Schiller emerged from the building just short of an hour later, the manila folder gone. By then, the stunning intent of his visit to the FBI was known, and the ramifications of a sitting president firing the man investigating his campaign's ties to Russia were reverberating across Washington.

This account of the lead-up and the aftermath of Trump's decision is based on interviews with more than two dozen officials at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI and on Capitol Hill, nearly all of whom spoke anonymously to describe an extraordinarily sensitive moment for Trump and his presidency.

Backlash begins

Backlash was swift, with claims from Democrats that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia. Even some Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were troubled by the development and its timing. Comparisons to Richard Nixon, who fired a special prosecutor probing the Watergate burglary, began flying.

The White House insisted the firing came amid questions about Comey's handing of a probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. But that explanation was betrayed by Trump's letter, which didn't mention those concerns, focusing instead on the continuing inquiry into his campaign's Russia ties.

Officials in the West Wing, many of whom weren't aware Trump was planning to fire Comey, appeared caught off guard by the furor.

The collective recoil against the move prompted urgent meetings among Trump's aides to manage the fallout. Hours after telling reporters that the White House would have no additional comment beyond Trump's own words, top aides were marched to television cameras on the North Lawn to explain the decision.

One source familiar with the President's reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.

Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

Closely held decision

The idea of firing Comey was closely held within the West Wing, these officials say, where the few aides who were aware of Trump's intentions barely discussed the topic among themselves. Among those looped in: Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who began fine-tuning their rationale for removing Comey from his post shortly after learning of Trump's intentions.

On Tuesday, they had their explanation: Comey mishandled the investigation into Clinton's emails.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails,"" Rosenstein wrote in a letter that the White House released Tuesday. ""I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.""

By the time the memo was complete, Trump was already preparing to execute his decision. His schedule was almost entirely cleared on Monday and Tuesday except for meetings with his national security team. Nearly as soon as Comey's firing was announced, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director, to gauge the agency's No. 2 before elevating him to acting director following Comey's dismissal.

Meanwhile, back at FBI headquarters, news was quickly spreading that Comey was being ushered out. Instead of delivering Trump's letter to Comey in person, Schiller deposited the document at his office. Comey, in fact, wasn't at his agency's headquarters at all when Schiller arrived with the missive from the President; he was addressing agents at the FBI's Los Angeles field office when news came down that Trump had demanded his resignation.

Instead of learning from Trump's letter that he was being fired, Comey found out from television. TVs set to cable news inside the room he was speaking began airing reports of his demise midway through his speech. He made a joke about it to lighten the situation, phoned back to FBI headquarters, and received official confirmation that his tenure atop the law enforcement agency was over.

'I have no reason to believe ...'

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials speaking Tuesday said they were unaware that Trump was preparing to fire Comey, describing themselves afterward as shocked by the development.

Asked hours before announcing the decision whether Trump maintained confidence in Comey, Spicer avoided answered forthrightly.

""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said. ""I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this.""

The decision came at an uneasy moment for the Justice Department, which has been at the center of controversy since Trump assumed office in January. Officials described tensions that have festered over the past several months between Justice Department leadership and senior staff at the FBI over the handling of the Clinton investigation and how Comey was running the agency, according to multiple officials.

Meanwhile, the White House and Sessions have pushed the FBI to pursue leaks of classified information to the media, according to one Justice Department official, urging the agency to prioritize the probe over other matters, including the investigation into Russian election meddling.

One Justice official suggested there could be more changes coming at the FBI beyond Comey's removal.

""There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,"" one official said.

Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before Trump fired Comey.

Shock and confusion

While a handful of top senators were given a heads-up by Trump, the overwhelming sentiment on Capitol Hill was one of shock and confusion.

In some GOP offices, there was an open question of how exactly to respond, with communications staffers reaching out to their colleagues to try and unify their initial draft statements. Without advance notice or guidance from the White House at the start, many offices were stuck in a holding pattern, according to several aides for Republican senators.

For several senators, including some on the Senate judiciary or intelligence committees that oversee the FBI, it was news alerts on their mobile phones or reporters in hallways who broke the news of Comey's removal.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, was presiding over the Senate when the news hit.

""Basically, the parliamentarian told me,"" Rubio told reporters as he walked off the Senate floor. ""I don't have any initial reaction because I don't have any information.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, never shy about expressing his views on an issue, emerged from another senator's office to tell reporters he would be withholding judgments until he had a better handle on what had just occurred.

Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a member of the intelligence committee, told reporters he was ""surprised"" by the firing, and wasn't given a heads-up by the White House.

For Senate Democrats, it was a more straightforward process. Within 20 minutes, statement after statement began rolling out of Democrats questioning Trump's motives -- and using the firing to try and spark new momentum for a special prosecutor or independent commission to look into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.

For members of the House, currently out on recess, it was a scramble by their top staffers to try and get in touch and even brief them on the news. Some lawmakers are out of the country. Others were just about to walk into town halls. Many senior staffers had already departed for the evening by the time the news broke.

6,James Comey's fall,"(CNN) James Comey came to the FBI with a hero's reputation: He famously stood up to President George W. Bush's aides in a dramatic hospital-room confrontation over secret wiretapping.

He had few enemies in Washington when he took the helm of the FBI on a 93-1 Senate vote in 2013.

But by the time President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped him late Tuesday, Comey had few clear friends left in town -- with his reputation under siege. His critics on both the left and the right attacked his handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's emails, Trump's Russia ties , and more.

The sudden firing threw into doubt the independence of the FBI's ongoing Russia investigation and the stability of the bureau itself, which has been wracked by charges that Comey's political meddling in the fall campaign compromised its mission.

The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation and other campaign controversies since last fall, but the rapid-fire events on Tuesday added a historic level of drama to a story that has gripped Washington for months.

Not since the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" at the height of the Watergate scandal has the delicate relationship between the White House and the FBI been thrown into such turmoil.

On that night in 1973, President Richard Nixon fired a series of top Justice Department officials after they refused to fire a special prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate abuses.

Democrats, who had savaged Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, reversed course and portrayed him Tuesday not as a villain, but as a victim. They quickly cast the firing in Nixonian terms and accused Trump of trying to quash the ongoing Russia investigation.

Congressman Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the firing ""brazen interference"" in the FBI's investigation.

Even Republican Senator Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed concern over Comey's firing : ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" he said in a statement.

Comey said last week at a Senate hearing that he was pained and ""mildly nauseous"" over the thought that his actions might have affected the presidential election.

But he said he had no regrets, and he had shown no indication he thought his job was in jeopardy. He has even ticked off the exact number of days he had left until his 10-year term expired in 2023 -- a term he expected to complete.

The political attacks were a remarkable turn for the 6'8"" Comey, a towering and charismatic figure who had risen to power with seeming effortlessness earlier in his career.

As a federal prosecutor in Richmond, Va. in the 1990s, Comey earned high marks for a novel program that saw long prison terms for felons who used guns in their crimes. He was then given the coveted job of US Attorney in Manhattan -- before President Bush tapped him to become the second-ranking official for the entire Justice Department.

In that post, Comey burnished his reputation as an honest broker willing to stand up to power -- even at the risk of his own job.

In 2004, when his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis, Comey refused to sign off on a secret eavesdropping program approved by Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks because he believed it might be illegal.

Two of Bush's aides, Alberto Gonzales and Andy Card, raced to the hospital to try to get Ashcroft's bedside signature to continue the wiretapping program.

But Comey, with sirens blazing on his security detail's car, beat them there and raced up the stairs to his boss's hospital room, where Ashcroft stood by his underling's decision.

The episode became a part of the Comey lore when it was first revealed publicly more than a year later.

As director of the FBI, Comey spoke frequently and passionately about distancing the bureau from the dictatorial days of J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year reign.

On his desk at the FBI, he kept a copy of a letter from Hoover for the wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. -- a dark reminder, Comey said, of the bureau's abusive past.

With public opinion turning on him over the Clinton email investigation, however, Comey appeared to realize that he was becoming increasingly isolated after years of stardom.

At a memorial service for a prosecutor held at a packed Justice Department auditorium just days before the November election, Comey joked sardonically in a eulogy about how unpopular he seemed to have become in the eyes of some colleagues.

His own memorial service, he suggested, would no doubt be held in a much smaller venue.",cnn
6,Trump fires FBI director James Comey,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election.

The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal there would be no backlash.

What was not thought through apparently was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe.

In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was re-opening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation.

The letters

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,"" Trump told Comey in the letter. ""I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

JUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03

Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution.

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein argued in his memo.

""We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),"" Rosenstein said. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

Congressional reaction

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?"" Schumer asked

And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading an Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said.

As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed.

""I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general is competent to lead that effort,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership.

But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would ""raise questions.""

Sen. John McCain added: ""While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.""

The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations.

'Absurd'

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.""

""This is not something that is within the American political tradition,"" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

""This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,"" Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director.

The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25.

A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

Team Clinton reaction

Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation.

""I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called ""charade"" only 24 hours ago,"" said Clinton's former campaign manager Robby Mook.

""It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,"" he said.

One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Scuitto.

""I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,"" the person said.

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials say they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they are shocked by the development.

Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President.

Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin ""forwarded hundreds and thousands"" of emails to her husband's laptop.

The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the ""hundreds and thousands of emails"" that Comey said were 'forwarded"" from Abedin to her husband's email ""included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.""

The White House said it will immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions.

Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world.

In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did.

But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election, put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight.

Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being ""extremely careless"" with sensitive information.

Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the ""political"" decision.

Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had re-opened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges.

After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part.

Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""

After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House.

He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief.

""Oh, here's Jim,"" Trump said in January. ""He's become more famous than me.""",cnn

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

Closely held decision

The idea of firing Comey was closely held within the West Wing, these officials say, where the few aides who were aware of Trump's intentions barely discussed the topic among themselves. Among those looped in: Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who began fine-tuning their rationale for removing Comey from his post shortly after learning of Trump's intentions.

On Tuesday, they had their explanation: Comey mishandled the investigation into Clinton's emails.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails,"" Rosenstein wrote in a letter that the White House released Tuesday. ""I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.""

By the time the memo was complete, Trump was already preparing to execute his decision. His schedule was almost entirely cleared on Monday and Tuesday except for meetings with his national security team. Nearly as soon as Comey's firing was announced, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director, to gauge the agency's No. 2 before elevating him to acting director following Comey's dismissal.

Meanwhile, back at FBI headquarters, news was quickly spreading that Comey was being ushered out. Instead of delivering Trump's letter to Comey in person, Schiller deposited the document at his office. Comey, in fact, wasn't at his agency's headquarters at all when Schiller arrived with the missive from the President; he was addressing agents at the FBI's Los Angeles field office when news came down that Trump had demanded his resignation.

Instead of learning from Trump's letter that he was being fired, Comey found out from television. TVs set to cable news inside the room he was speaking began airing reports of his demise midway through his speech. He made a joke about it to lighten the situation, phoned back to FBI headquarters, and received official confirmation that his tenure atop the law enforcement agency was over.

'I have no reason to believe ...'

Senior Justice Department and FBI officials speaking Tuesday said they were unaware that Trump was preparing to fire Comey, describing themselves afterward as shocked by the development.

Asked hours before announcing the decision whether Trump maintained confidence in Comey, Spicer avoided answered forthrightly.

""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said. ""I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this.""

The decision came at an uneasy moment for the Justice Department, which has been at the center of controversy since Trump assumed office in January. Officials described tensions that have festered over the past several months between Justice Department leadership and senior staff at the FBI over the handling of the Clinton investigation and how Comey was running the agency, according to multiple officials.

Meanwhile, the White House and Sessions have pushed the FBI to pursue leaks of classified information to the media, according to one Justice Department official, urging the agency to prioritize the probe over other matters, including the investigation into Russian election meddling.

One Justice official suggested there could be more changes coming at the FBI beyond Comey's removal.

""There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,"" one official said.

Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before Trump fired Comey.

Shock and confusion

While a handful of top senators were given a heads-up by Trump, the overwhelming sentiment on Capitol Hill was one of shock and confusion.

In some GOP offices, there was an open question of how exactly to respond, with communications staffers reaching out to their colleagues to try and unify their initial draft statements. Without advance notice or guidance from the White House at the start, many offices were stuck in a holding pattern, according to several aides for Republican senators.

For several senators, including some on the Senate judiciary or intelligence committees that oversee the FBI, it was news alerts on their mobile phones or reporters in hallways who broke the news of Comey's removal.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, was presiding over the Senate when the news hit.

""Basically, the parliamentarian told me,"" Rubio told reporters as he walked off the Senate floor. ""I don't have any initial reaction because I don't have any information.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, never shy about expressing his views on an issue, emerged from another senator's office to tell reporters he would be withholding judgments until he had a better handle on what had just occurred.

Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a member of the intelligence committee, told reporters he was ""surprised"" by the firing, and wasn't given a heads-up by the White House.

For Senate Democrats, it was a more straightforward process. Within 20 minutes, statement after statement began rolling out of Democrats questioning Trump's motives -- and using the firing to try and spark new momentum for a special prosecutor or independent commission to look into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.

For members of the House, currently out on recess, it was a scramble by their top staffers to try and get in touch and even brief them on the news. Some lawmakers are out of the country. Others were just about to walk into town halls. Many senior staffers had already departed for the evening by the time the news broke.

The meeting will take place at 10:30 a.m. ET in the Oval Office and will be closed to press, according to the White House.

Lavrov had planned to be in Washington Wednesday to meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson and Lavrov are scheduled to meet earlier Wednesday to discuss Ukraine, Syria and bilateral issues, the State Department announced.

In addition to the tensions between Washington and Moscow over geopolitics, the meetings between Tillerson and Lavrov, and now between Trump and the Russian foreign minister, come against a backdrop of recriminations over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections and the firing of FBI director James Comey.

Comey was dismissed Tuesday , the White House announced, sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign team colluded with Russia in its alleged interference in last year's election.

6,Comey firing draws comparisons to Nixon,"Story highlights Richard Nixon ordered Watergate special prosecutor to be fired in 1973

Trump critics call for appointment of special prosecutor to investigate alleged dealings between Trump campaign and Russia

(CNN) The ""Saturday Night Massacre"" was one of the most dramatic turns of events in the Watergate scandal -- the political drama that rocked the United States in the 1970s and led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

President Nixon and the Attorney General's office were locked in a political standoff over Nixon's refusal to comply with orders to release recordings of White House conversations.

Richard Nixon, left, and Archibald Cox, right.

Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. But Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than comply with the order. Cox was eventually fired by the US solicitor general.

Critics of President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey see similiarities between Cox's firing decades ago and Trump's action on Tuesday.

The Trump administration, critics say, is trying to undermine the FBI's investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, just as Nixon tried to stop lawmakers from learning the truth about his role in the Watergate scandal.

The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.

3,FBI chief James Comey fired by Trump,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says.

The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"".

But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information about Mrs Clinton's emails to Congress last week.

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the Department of Justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately.

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when he was handed a note by one of his team informing him he had just been fired.

The 56-year-old - who was four years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.

Why does the administration say Comey was fired?

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the Clinton emails investigation, given that Mr Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.

But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"".

""Almost everyone agrees the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.""

He said Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 to announce the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.

The deputy attorney general said Mr Comey compounded his error by ""gratuitously"" releasing ""derogatory information"" about Mrs Clinton.

What about the Russia investigation?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer: ""Mr President, with all due respect, you're making a big mistake""

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

Mr Trump retorted on Twitter: ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, 'I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.' Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp"".

The firing is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when President Richard Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

But President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russia allegations are ""fake news"".

What are Republicans saying?

Richard Burr, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Jim Comey's termination.""

Justin Amash, a conservative Michigan congressman, said he was considering a plan to set up an independent commission on Russia.

Mr Amash described as ""bizarre"" a paragraph of Mr Trump's letter to Mr Comey - in which he says the FBI director informed the president on three occasions he was not under investigation.

Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, a longstanding Trump critic, said the ""timing of the firing is very troubling"".

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior Justice Department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree. The president didn't help his cause by specifically asserting that he was ""not under investigation"" in his letter to Mr Comey.

Already Democrats are clamouring for the ex-director to testify before Congress about the state of the FBI's Russia investigation at the time of his dismissal.

Just days after becoming president, Mr Trump shook Mr Comey's hand at a White House event and said ""he's become more famous than me"". That may have been an exaggeration at the time.

It seems less like one now.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

He told the Senate last week it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again.

Mrs Clinton blames Mr Comey for her shock election defeat last November to Donald Trump.

Mr Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her then-husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had only sent two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.

The clarification was made in a letter from the FBI's assistant director of congressional affairs, Gregory Brower, to the congressional committee.

The majority of the 49,000 emails investigators uncovered on Mr Weiner's laptop were transferred via automatic backup from her work Blackberry device, Mr Brower wrote.

6,General election 2017: Labour and Lib Dems pledge school cash,"Image copyright PA

Labour and the Lib Dems are both making multibillion pound funding pledges to tackle school cash shortages in England.

Labour says it would raise corporation tax to spend £4.8bn on keeping up with rising costs, and £335m so no schools lost out from a funding reorganisation.

The Lib Dems are promising £7bn to protect per-pupil funding levels.

The Conservatives said school spending had reached record levels and attacked the two parties' spending plans.

Headteachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

A new funding formula will also see some schools lose money, although others will gain.

On Monday, the Institute of Fiscal Studies said protecting schools from real-terms cuts in England would mean spending the equivalent of an extra penny on the basic rate of income tax.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner are promising a real-terms funding increase in schools and ""free lifelong education"" in colleges, including restoring the Educational Maintenance Allowance.

This would be paid for by increasing corporation tax from the current 19% to 26% by 2021, Labour said.

""We will invest in schools and in our young people, ensuring no primary pupils go hungry during the day, reducing class sizes so children can learn and teachers can teach, and restoring the maintenance allowance and grants for students in both further and higher education,"" Ms Rayner said.

The Lib Dems claimed their plans went further than Labour's and said details of how they would funded would be provided ""in due course"" in the party's manifesto.

The party said it would also protect further education per-pupil funding in real terms.

'Made-up promises'

Lib Dem education spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: ""While funding per pupil is set to see the biggest cuts in a generation, billions of pounds are being spent on divisive plans to expand grammars and free schools.

""This extra £7bn of funding would ensure no school and no child loses out.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already committed the corporation tax rise to other projects.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said Labour's announcement was ""just made-up promises on the back of nonsensical spending plans"".

He added: ""The Lib Dems are no better and won't even tell people about the tax rises they would bring in.""

BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys says schools in England have been experiencing a financial squeeze for the first time in 20 years, and plans for the different funding formula have galvanised lobbying by headteachers and parents.

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news
6,Conservative election expenses charging decision due,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The way the Conservatives' ""battle bus"" spending was recorded is being investigated

Prosecutors are expected to announce on Wednesday whether Conservative politicians or officials will face charges for breaches of expenses rules.

The CPS is considering files sent by police following investigations in up to 27 constituencies.

It relates to claims some campaigning costs in the 2015 general election were wrongly recorded.

The Conservative Party has insisted administrative errors were to blame rather than any intention to deceive.

And it has said some of the spending was correctly declared.

Complex rules

It is alleged the Conservatives spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

Up to 16 police forces across England have submitted files to be considered by prosecutors.

The CPS will consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a breach in the law, and whether a prosecution is ""in the public interest"".

If general election candidates are prosecuted the Conservative Party will have to decide whether to suspend them and replace them as nominees.

The last date for candidates to register for the election is 11 May.

3,Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Australian Senator Larissa Waters with her daughter, Alia Joy

Australian Senator Larissa Waters has become the first politician to breastfeed in the nation's parliament.

Ms Waters, from the left-wing Greens party, fed two-month-old daughter Alia Joy during a vote on Tuesday.

The lower house last year joined the Senate in allowing breastfeeding, but no MPs in either house had done so.

It followed a backlash in 2015 when Kelly O'Dwyer, a government minister, was asked to consider expressing milk to avoid missing parliamentary duties.

""We need more women and parents in Parliament,"" Ms Waters said on Facebook.

""And we need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable child care, for everyone.""

Flexibility urged

Labor Senator Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged.

""Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world,"" she told Sky News Australia.

""Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby... the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.""

Until last year, MPs in the lower House of Representatives could take babies only into parliamentary offices or public galleries.

Politicians have been permitted to breastfeed in the Senate since 2003.

The subject is a sensitive issue in many parliaments around the world. In 2016, Spanish MP Carolina Bescansa, from the Podemos (We Can) party, was both criticised and commended for by taking her baby into parliament and breastfeeding him.

Last year, a report on diversity in UK politics recommended that allowing breastfeeding in the House of Commons should be considered.

However, one MP in 2015 warned it could risk ridicule from the tabloid press.",bbc-news

3,Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption US special forces have been supporting SDF units on the ground

US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says.

Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.

The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.

Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.

The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.

SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.

The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.

The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.

The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.

Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".

Analysis: Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Washington

The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.

The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.

The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.

US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.

A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.

The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.

No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.

""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""

3,Venezuela sees sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Health care workers protested in February in Caracas against President Nicolas Maduro's government, the lack of medicines and low salaries

There has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in Venezuela.

In the first figures released for two years, the Health Ministry said the number of women dying in childbirth was up by 65%, while child deaths were up 30%.

There has also been a jump in illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria.

The figures reflect the country's deep economic crisis which the opposition says the government has mismanaged.

President Nicolas Maduro says the health crisis is caused by medicines being hoarded to encourage a coup against him.

The country has the largest oil reserves in the world but the collapse of oil prices a few years ago led to a recession and a shortage of the foreign currency needed to import equipment, food and medicines.

Venezuelans face shortages of everything from food to vaccines.

Sorry state of hospitals

UN to supply medicines?

In a recent survey, three-quarters of Venezuelans say their health has plummeted, and that they are eating less than two meals a day. Many report losing an average of around 9 kilos (19 pounds).

In the health sector, large numbers of doctors have emigrated. A leading pharmaceutical association has said around 85% of medicines are in short supply.

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, a critic of the government's health policies, Dr Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist said:

""The striking part is the turmoil in almost all categories that this bulletin addresses, with particularly significant increased in the infant and maternal health categories.""

Many Venezuelans have trekked to the border with Brazil or Colombia to buy medicine there and seek treatment in public hospitals in neighbouring countries.

In Brazil, the state of Roraima declared a state of emergency to deal with thousands of Venezuelans seeking treatment by the public health service in small border towns.

It is not clear why Venezuela's Health Ministry published its figures now. It had stopped releasing figures after July 2015.

10,Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect in major Windows 10 news,"Moved temporarily a few months back and physically a few hundred miles north compared to last year, Microsoft’s Build 2017 developer conference is nearly underway.

With the first keynote set to start on May 10 at 8am PT (11am ET / 4pm BST / 1am May 11 AEST) from Seattle, Washington, Microsoft has plenty to chat about this year despite holding a major media event just last week to tout Windows 10 S and the Surface Laptop.

The most notable topics we expect to see detailed are Redstone 3, the codename for Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update, Project Neon, Microsoft’s visual makeover-in-progress for the operating system (OS), Cortana and even more mixed reality advancements.

With that, here is everything we can bank on seeing during the Build 2017 keynotes starting May 10.

Redstone 3 gets unearthed

Microsoft’s Windows Insider Program members are, technically, already testing out Redstone 3 as you read this. We know this because features that were originally slated for Redstone 2, i.e. the Creators Update, but missed the deadline are now in testing through the latest Insider Preview build of Windows 10 (as of this writing): Build 16188.

Chief among those features left on the Creators Update cutting room floor is My People, a feature that brings your favorite contacts directly into the Windows 10 taskbar for easier file sharing and messaging. Expect to see more of this discussed on stage this week.

Other major expected features to be detailed are PDF editing features in Microsoft Edge (already in the latest Insider Preview build), Power Throttling to reduce apps’ power draw on laptops and tablet PCs and further improvements to more transparent automated OS updates.

We also wouldn’t be surprised to see Redstone 3 get its official name and, at the very least, a release window (if not a hard date) since Microsoft has promised two major updates annually.

Cortana branches out

That Harman Kardon unveiled its Invoke speaker powered by Microsoft’s Cortana just days before Build 2017 is no coincidence. With the long-rumored rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home now out in the open, expect Microsoft to spend some considerable time on this initiative.

In fact, controls for Cortana-powered speakers were already found within the earliest Insider Preview builds for Redstone 3. On that note, expect to hear a lot more about how far the Amazon Alexa-like Cortana Skills and device software developer kits have come since their announcement last year.

However, we find it hard to believe that Microsoft will sit on these tools until Redstone 3 becomes a fancy-named update that hits every Windows 10 device. After all, don’t expect Amazon and Google – or even the rumored Apple Siri Speaker – to slow down over the next five months.

Project Neon ... or Aero Glass 2.0

Microsoft’s fateful fall update should see the oft-teased visual overhaul to the Windows 10 interface known currently as Project Neon.

In short, the new visuals bring back a lot of the translucent design elements found in the Aero Glass design ID that started in Windows Vista and were found throughout Windows 7 before being dropped for Windows 8.

Furthermore, Project Neon markedly changes how Windows 10 animations in transitioning between apps look and feel. That said, early previews have stated that Neon is aiming for a simple aesthetic, so we’ll see how Microsoft achieves that balance with new animations in the mix.

Mixed reality gets a huge push

Unless Microsoft plans to give them a spotlight during its May 23 Surface event, Build 2017 would be the place to show even more of its partners’ head-mounted displays (HMDs).

Having already shown off Acer’s HMD at length during the Taiwanese firm’s annual New York hardware showcase, it’d be surprising not to see already-teased partners like Lenovo, Dell and HP not take the chance to get the word out regarding their Windows 10 Holographic devices.

Bonus round: maybe we’ll finally hear about price regarding any of Microsoft’s partners’ HMD devices. It’s a crucial point going into the holiday season, especially when it’s highly unlikely that either HTC or Facebook have 2017 hardware that can match that $299 starting price.",techradar
10,Amazon Echo Show launched: everything you need to know,"Amazon has finally announced the Amazon Echo Show, the first Echo device equipped with a screen.

The Show follows in the footsteps of the recently announced Amazon Echo Look, which combined Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with a camera that can take pictures and offer style recommendations.

The Show is a radical departure from previous Echo devices as it can provide you with information visually (via its screen) as well as through sound; previous speakers were limited to using voice to communicate.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products

The newest entry in Amazon's voice-activated line of Echo products How much will it cost? $230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba)

$230 (rumored to be £220 in the UK, and AU price tba) When is it out? June 28 and up for pre-order now on Amazon US with no official UK or AU release date yet announced

Amazon Echo Show release date

Confirming what was rumored earlier today due to a leak, Amazon has announced that the Amazon Echo Show will be released on June 28 in both the US and UK, with pre-orders open now in the US.

That means you'll have to wait a month and a half to get your hands on the new speaker if you order it today in the US.

Although the device is rumored to be coming to the UK simultaneously with the US, no official announcement about UK availability has yet been made.

Since Australia is still yet to receive the Amazon Echo, we're not holding our collective breath for the Echo Show to make its way there anytime soon.

Amazon Echo Show features

As well as the Alexa voice assistant, which we've become familiar with thanks to its inclusion in existing Amazon Echo speakers and Amazon Fire TV devices, the Amazon Echo Show is equipped with both a screen and a webcam, which will allow it to both show you, as well as tell you, information.

The screen is seven inches in size, and is touchscreen-enabled. It's capable of showing notifications, playing internet video, and showing lyrics on Amazon Music, among other things, and it can also facilitate conversations between different devices in the same house.

It'll be interesting to see whether this functionality is expanded in the future to enable the Show to make voice calls outside of the home, as a pre-announcement leak from the WSJ suggested.

The screen can also be configured to show a live video feed from elsewhere in the house through compatible third-party security cameras.

In addition to the screen, the Amazon Echo Show is also equipped with a camera, as is the recently announced Amazon Echo Look. Amazon is pitching the Look as a style accessory, which will, for example, analyse your clothes in order to offer outfit suggestions.

This functionality will presumably also be making its way to the new Amazon Echo Show, although this is yet to be confirmed.

The Show is available in black or white color options.

As well as this new screen and camera functionality, the Show is compatible with Amazon's existing library of skills, which range from ordering cabs with Uber to controlling smart lightbulbs and thermostats, although existing skills will be audio-only until they're made Show-compatible.

The Show is equipped with eight microphones, which is one more than the existing Amazon Echo speaker. Given that the existing Echo is already pretty good at picking up our voice we're unsure why an extra microphone is needed, but it's a nice inclusion all the same.

Finally, the new device is equipped with Bluetooth, so even if your music app of choice isn't supported natively (such as Apple Music), you can still stream it to the Echo Show.

Pre-announcement leaks

We first heard rumors of the Amazon Echo Show a couple of months ago when Cnet reported that Amazon was planning on announcing a screen-equipped Echo device.

That report claimed the device, which we now know to be the Amazon Echo Show, was planned for later in the year, but its release was pushed forward after fears that Google Home was progressing more quickly than expected.

Then, just a few days ago, AFTVnews discovered a low-resolution image of the new device, codenamed the Echo 'Knight', on Amazon's servers. When it posted the discovery on Twitter, journalist Evan Blass responded with a much higher-resolution version of the same image.

@AFTVnews Here, let me help you with that. pic.twitter.com/9YokBj4pXQMay 5, 2017

This week saw the leak of an announcement date of May 9, followed by a further leak of the price, release date, and name.

Between all of these leaks we've built up a pretty good idea of what the new device should be capable of, and most of the leaks have now been confirmed by the official announcement.",techradar
10,Here's what the OS that could replace* Android and Chrome OS looks like,"Fuchsia, the mysterious new operating system from Google, has taken another step forward, lifting the veil on its user interface.

Screenshots have surfaced showing Fuchsia's UI so far, giving users and programmers alike their first real glance at Google's new OS, as reported by Ars Technica.

Unlike Chrome OS and Android, which are built on Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a Google-made microkernel called Magenta. According to Google programmers, Magenta's focus is on ""modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors.""

Though it's currently just speculation, it's possible that Fuchsia could be the beginning of a new software standard for Google-made products. The search giant is rumored to be trimming the edges on its operating systems, as seen by it bridging some apps between Android and Chrome OS last year.

As for Fuchsia, the new OS uses a current default system UI called Armadillo to build its layout and manage widgets. You can see how it compares visually to its Google-made kin in the images below:

Image 1 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 2 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica) Image 3 of 3 Image Credit: Ars Technica (Image: © Ars Technica)

From first glance, Fuchsia maintains similar notes to Chrome OS and Android, such as clear-cut widgets and a colorful palette for windows on apps and notifications. Also noticeable are entire sections of the interface dedicated to Google's search functions and suggested content.

However, you can get a better idea what sets Fuchsia apart when it's in motion, a such as in the video below, courtesy of Kyle Bradshaw of Hotfix.net:

To be clear, Google hasn't stated any plans to actively replace Android or Chrome OS at this time, nor has it given a timeframe for when we might see its experimental new OS make its way to consumer products (if at all.)

That said, as we near ever closer to the Google IO 2017 conference next week, we might be lucky enough to learn more about what the tech giant has planned for its latest creation. In the meantime, the open-source files are available via GitHub for any crafty coders looking to dive into Fuchsia for themselves.

Blocky design

No quick charging

If the Anker isn't right for you, our next choice is the Aukey 20,000mAh battery pack. It features two ports so you can charge both your phone and your tablet at the same time and also has a light to show you how much battery charge is leftover.

The blocky design may not be for everyone, but this portable charger should be able to charge your phone and other gadgets a few times over with such a high capacity cell inside.

RAVPower Portable charger

Bright with a large capacity

Bright color options

Compact design

Could be smaller

This is the cheapest option for a portable charger we have on the list, but this option from RAVPower should suit you for recharging your mobile phone while on the go.

It has a capacity of 6,700mAh, which should recharge your average smartphone at least once and maybe even twice. There are three color options here with the choices of either pink, bright blue or silver.

The LEDs on the side of the device also show you how much charge is left and there's fast-charging tech built-in too.

Best slim portable chargers

Iceworks 5000mAh Portable Charger

For those looking for something slimmer

Slim design

No need to bring cables

Short charging cables

Not suitable for USB-C

If you're looking for a slim charger you can slide into your bag's front pocket, this option from Iceworks is going to suit you nicely. There's no need to carry around a cable with this version, as the charging cables are built directly into the body.

Be warned, the Iceworks 5,000mAh charger will only work with micro USB (older Android devices) and Lightning (newer iPhone models) as there's no USB-C cable on here.

Poweradd Pilot 2GS

Metal and sleek

High capacity

Quick recharge

Still quite heavy

Poweradd also offers a great slim portable charger, and it's one of the cheapest options on this list yet boasts a substantial 10,000mAh cell inside.

It may be quite heavy, but this is only 1.3cm thick, making it a great device to slip into your back pocket when you're out and about. You'll want to grab a cable to go with it though as unlike the Iceworks choice above it doesn't come with one built in.

Lepow Portable External Battery Charger

A better design than the rest

Interesting design

Super portable

Takes a while to charge

The best looking device we've chosen is the Lepow portable charger. It comes in a variety of colors and can be easily slipped into your pocket, as it's much smaller than many options on this list.

You will need to make sure you have a cable with you to connect it up to your device, but it comes with a 5,000mAh battery inside, which is enough to charge up almost any smartphone at least once.

Best portable chargers with lots of ports

MAXOAK 50000mAh

A whole six ports

Six ports

Huge battery

Large design

This may not be the most portable charger on our list, but it features a lot of ports, so you can charge multiple devices at the same time. It'll even charge laptops as well as your phone and tablet.

You can charge six devices at once, and with a 50,000mAh capacity it has the juice to do that, so if you're usually surrounded by a lot of tech this is possibly one of the best chargers to buy.

Qi-infinity Upgraded 35,000mAh Powerbank

Huge in battery and size

Four ports

35,000mAh size

Large design

Doesn't work with all laptops

Looking for a another option with lots of ports on it? This may be a good choice for you, as there are four ports and you can charge up your MacBook as well as USB devices such as your phone.

There's a quick charge port too, which will fast charge compatible devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7.

ZeroLemon ToughJuice Rugged Portable Charger

One you can throw around

Four ports

Surprisingly portable

Not a huge capacity for the price

After a rugged charger that won't break if it takes a beating? The ZeroLemon ToughJuice pack could be a great choice for you, as it comes with a solid design that isn't too large to slip into your bag or even your back pocket.

It also features four USB ports, so you're able to charge a number of devices all at the same time.

Best portable chargers for laptops and phones

RAVPower Universal Power Bank Travel Charger

One for your laptop

AC output

20,100mAh capacity

Big design

RAVPower's portable charger is a great choice if you need a device that can charge both your laptop and your phone. It features USB-C and normal USB outputs as well as an AC output, so you can plug your laptop charger directly in.

There's also a 20,100mAh capacity battery inside, so this will be able to juice up your phone or tablet multiple times before you need to put it back on charge.

Poweradd Pilot Pro2

The white option

23,000mAh capacity

Easy to see display

Not particularly portable

The picture above may be deceptive, as this isn't a small charger and is capable of charging up your laptop or tablet as well as your phone simultaneously.

You can charge up to three devices at the same time and it comes with a 23,000mAh capacity, so it should last long enough between recharges.

Bestek Car Jump Starter

Something different

Huge capacity

Can jump start a car

Not very portable

The largest charger in this category (in terms of size, though not capacity) is also one of the most innovative, as this one can even jump start your car.

It features a huge 13,600mAh battery that can give your car that much needed jolt whenever you need it to, but also comes with various ports for your phone or laptop to charge as well.",techradar
10,Has Meizu's quick charge tech reinvented the smartphone?,"Do you carry a portable charger for your smartphone? They seem innocent enough, but those small black boxes are like a sticking plaster over the tech industry's gaping wound; pathetic phone batteries not fit for the modern mobile age.

It's not just the Pokémon Go app that drains the life from smartphones, with navigation apps like Google Maps, firmware updates, and even just the camera app eating away at battery life at a worrying rate.

So could a claim by Chinese phone maker Meizu that it now has the technology to recharge a phone in less than 20 minutes change everything?

Super mCharge is expected to be used in phones inside two years. © Jamie Carter

Short battery life is a huge problem for the phone industry, whose minor improvements in power efficiency have been swallowed up by the ever-increasing size of smartphone screens.

""Smartphones have become more power-hungry, and battery life and charging technology has failed to keep pace, leaving users often unsatisfied with the battery life of their devices,"" says James Manning Smith, Information Analyst at Futuresource Consulting.

He points out that manufacturers have three choices when designing a phone; larger batteries in devices, more efficient components, and making charging more convenient for users.

Meizu has taken the middle road with its Super mCharge technology, which it unveiled at a press event at Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona. The live demo saw an empty smartphone fill-up in precisely 18 minutes and 55 seconds.

Not exactly a riveting watch for onlookers, but impressive nonetheless. After over a year of R&D, said Meizu, it had improved the power of a Super mCharge battery to 55W, and accelerated charging speed by 5.5 times.

© Jamie Carter

An industry first

That 55W figure is key. “Meizu's 55W charging is a first for the mobile industry,” says Manning Smith, who confirms that it's a more powerful charging solution than anything already on the market.

“Standard USB charging is 5W, while some OEMs have released phones with 15-18W charging, such as Motorola, Samsung and Oppo.”

The battery inside the Meizu demo phone was 3,000mAh, which is a typical size for a smartphone (for comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses a 3,000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 claims a 1,960mAh battery), though this one was specially designed by Meizu's engineers to bear more than four times the current so it could work with Super mCharge.

So what has Meizu actually achieved here? As well as taking charging to 55W, Meizu has dramatically accelerated the charging speed.

Technically speaking, Super mCharge uses charge pump technology; comprising two groups of circuits, the charge pump exports half of the voltage after transformation and improves efficiency by 8%.

""Our solution yields 98% efficiency, compared with other companies who struggle to hit 90%,"" claims Meizu.

Super mCharge also uses a USB cable that's been redesigned to carry up to 160W of power, and as a result it does cost three times more than a regular USB cable.

© Jamie Carter

Can the Meizu phone stand the heat?

There are two immediate concerns. Firstly, does fast charging mean the battery won't last very long? Secondly, is all that extra heat generated safe? After all, exploding batteries in smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have made us all nervous.

On the first question, Meizu insists that in tests its 3,000mAh battery retained more than 80 percent of its capacity after 800 charge and discharge cycles, so it should be good for two years' normal use.

On the second concern about safety, Meizu claims that its optimization algorithm means the highest temperature the battery reaches is 39°C/102°F (in an ambient temperature of 22°C/72°F), just a bit higher than body temperature.

Manning Smith explains that since smartphones are very condensed devices, engineering restrictions mean the heat that builds up during high-powered charging can damage the battery, and other components in the phone.

""Meizu has developed a technology that allows the battery to be charged at a very high rate, without exceeding dangerous temperature levels,"" he adds.

Quick Charge 4.0 features on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. © Jamie Carter

This is all impressive stuff, but only if the device can live up to Meizu's promises. ""Once the technology comes to market, it has the potential to set a new standard for wired smartphone charging,"" says Manning Smith.

That should happen during 2019 or 2020, but there's no guaranteed success for Super mCharge. Not only are several other similar innovations expected in that time-frame, but the general trend towards super-fast wired charging for phones looks set to be overtaken by the wireless charging era.

When it comes to super-fast wired charging, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 (QC3.0) for Android devices is the current front-runner, with QC4.0 just announced for new flagship Android phones that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset – and that includes the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, ZTE Gigabit and some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8.

QC4.0 claims to charge 20% faster than QC3.0 (which charges an empty phone to 50% in about 30 minutes). That's not as impressive as Super mCharge's promised speeds, but then again it's available already.

Can Meizu's technology compete with wireless pads?

""Wireless charging companies are trying to [create] a world in which charging cables are unnecessary,"" says Manning Smith, who admits that support for wireless charging pads in wider society is in its infancy.

However, Aircharge has been installing wireless charging stations in restaurants, airports and hotels, while IKEA is including wireless charging pads in some furniture.

""Should we see an increase in the availability of wireless charging outlets in our daily lives, there may be less need for fast charging technologies,"" Manning Smith says.

There are also efforts to develop high-wattage wireless charging. Bosch has wireless charging for power tools that it plans to take up to 60W and use in all kinds of mobile devices by 2020, which would surpass Meizu's achievement – while LG has been developing wireless charging pads that bring a fully discharged phone up to 50% in 30 minutes, (so on a par with QC3.0).

“The convenience of cable-free, little-and-often charges that wireless charging can provide may be more convincing for consumers than wired, but quick charging,” says Manning Smith.

So while Meizu's Super mCharge is an exciting achievement, the future belongs not to electrochemical cells, but wireless charging pads – probably starting with your car.",techradar
6,Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The White House reports Comey's dismissal comes after he was found in the middle of several political controversies like Russia's possible election interference and Hillary Clinton's handling of classified e-mails. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Just last week, President Trump was on Twitter accusing FBI Director James Comey of being too soft on his election opponent, Hillary Clinton.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" Trump tweeted May 2.

A week later, Trump sacked Comey — but for the exact opposite reason. Moments after announcing Comey's firing, the White House released a Justice Department letter that claimed Comey had inappropriately disparaged Clinton during the election campaign — and overstepped his bounds in publicly disclosing that he had reopened his investigation into the former secretary of State's emails.

Only Trump knows the real reason for Comey's firing.

But in his letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, Trump issued what appeared a Shakespearean protestation: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote to Comey on Tuesday.

Indeed, Comey was leading what appeared to be an open-ended investigation into Russian interference in the election — and what Trump associates knew about it. ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted Monday.

But Comey's firing will have the immediate effect of intensifying calls for an independent investigation to probe that very question.

After all, Comey was thrust into the role of refereeing the 2016 election because political appointees in the Obama and Trump administrations had been seen as incapable of doing so.

Former attorney general Loretta Lynch was forced to recuse herself from the Clinton probe after an ill-considered meeting with former president Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix in the midst of the investigation into his wife's emails.

Former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama holdover, was fired 10 days into the Trump administration — four days after she warned the White House that Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was susceptible to Russian blackmail.

And Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also had to recuse himself after misleading Congress about his own contacts with the Russian government while he served as a high-profile supporter of Trump's campaign.

So the political maelstrom Comey found himself in wasn't entirely of his own making. Still, Comey did not shun the spotlight that came with those politically sensitive investigations, holding unusually expository press conferences and giving freewheeling congressional testimony.

If there were any doubt that Comey was a pivotal figure in the 2016 presidential election, his firing as FBI director Tuesday should settle the issue for the history books.

It's a history that is still being written.

WASHINGTON – James Comey was supposed to have at least six more years in his term as FBI director.

Now that he’s been abruptly fired by President Trump, the White House has launched a search to replace him.

Who could take his place? Neither the FBI nor Justice Department would provide any leads. But there could be some clues.

Four years ago, when then-President Barack Obama selected Comey to succeed Robert Mueller, his name came from a list of potential candidates who may now have a new chance at the office.

The most-discussed names in that pool included some of most familiar names in national law enforcement, along with a former member of Congress.

Before Comey’s selection was announced in 2013, former Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, was the favorite of the FBI Agents Association, a group of 13,000 current and former agents.

""Chairman Rogers exemplifies the principles that should be possessed by the next FBI director,"" then-FBIAA President Konrad Motyka said at the time, announcing the association's support for Rogers. ""His unique and diverse experience as a veteran FBI agent and member of Congress will allow him to effectively lead the men and women of the bureau as they continue their work to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats.""

Ken Wainstein, a former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, was another favorite.

Earlier this week, Wainstein made a public appearance, even though he stayed off to the sidelines. He served as counsel to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a Monday appearance before a Senate subcommittee exploring Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Previously, he served as the FBI's general counsel and Mueller's chief of staff at the bureau.

At the Justice Department, Wainstein also once served as the chief federal prosecutor in D.C., and the director of the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, where he oversaw the operations of 94 federal prosecutors' offices in the U.S.

Another potential pick: John Pistole. Before his appointment as president of Anderson University in Indiana three years ago, the former deputy director of the FBI, had won notice for his steady direction of the Transportation Security Administration.

Pistole also is a close friend of Comey who attended the former TSA director's induction as Anderson University president.

Some current and former FBI agents also have pointed to Michael Mason, a former executive assistant FBI director, as a candidate for the top job.

Before leaving the bureau, Mason oversaw criminal and cyber investigations, coordinated international operations and the bureau's crisis response operations.

Two former New York officials were also linked to previous discussions about top jobs at the bureau and the Justice Department: former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

Giuliani, a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign, had been considered for a number of positions in the new administration, including attorney general and secretary of State. Meanwhile, Kelly is an executive at a private security firm.

As the search continues, the FBI is being headed by Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

But McCabe, who helped oversee the bureau's contentious investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, also has drawn heat.

McCabe's wife, a candidate for state office in Virginia, was the recipient of nearly $500,000 raised by an organization linked to Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The FBI claimed that the deputy director played no role in the campaign.

It's true that Nixon never fired a FBI director. That honor goes to Bill Clinton, who was the first (and up until Tuesday, the only) president to fire a FBI director. Back in 1993, Clinton fired William Sessions over ethical concerns. Sessions had refused to step down voluntarily.

Still, #Nixonian was trending Tuesday night after Comey's firing. In what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Nixon made a controversial move when he ordered the firing Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor charged with the investigation into the Watergate scandal. That led to the resignations of his attorney general, Elliott Richardson, and his deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus.

WASHINGTON — President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey in the middle of several investigations of possible Trump campaign ties to last year’s Russian meddling in U.S. elections caused a firestorm of protest from Democratic members of Congress, with many calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

Some equated the firing with events known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" during the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told Trump that he had made a “big mistake” when informed of the decision.

Schumer wondered aloud whether the firing meant Comey’s investigation was “getting too close to home,” and he said the handling of a credible investigation depends on Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein naming a “fearless, independent” special prosecutor.

“Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system which is going to be badly shattered after the administration’s actions today,"" Schumer said.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for the creation of a special congressional committee on Russia, while Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he and his staff were ""reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.""

""James Comey is a man of honor and integrity, and he has led the FBI well in extraordinary circumstances,"" McCain said.

Comey, a Republican who had served in the George W. Bush administration as second in command in the Justice Department, was the surprise choice of President Barack Obama for the FBI post.

He had established his independence in March 2004 when then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales sought to get Comey’s boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft, to sign off on a secret National Security Agency wiretap program. Ashcroft, seriously ill in the hospital with pancreatitis, had turned his duties over to Comey, who told Gonzales in Ashcroft’s hospital room that he refused to authorize the program.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the troubled House intelligence committee, said the firing raised profound questions about White House interference in a criminal probe.

“The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff said, likening the event to the Watergate firings.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., suggested Trump’s action poses serious constitutional issues, while others called the development “Nixonian.”

“The termination and removal of James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises the critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last presidential campaign will continue,” Durbin said.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate committee probing the Trump-Russia connection, called the firing “outrageous.”

“I have been long been a critic of Director Comey ... but Donald Trump’s decision to fire him now, in the midst of an investigation into Trump associates and their ties to Russia, is outrageous,"" Wyden said. He said Comey should be called to testify before Congress about the status of the Trump-Russia investigation.

“The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who questioned Comey at a hearing before a Judiciary subcommittee this week, said the way Trump is handling the firing “is shocking.”

“No one should accept President Trump’s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly,” Leahy said. “The president has removed the sitting FBI Director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country. This is nothing less than Nixonian.”

Leahy also noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom the president consulted before the firing, was supposed to have recused himself. He said Rosenstein now has no choice but to appoint a special counsel.

A long list of others calling for an independent probe included Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Ben Cardin, D-Md., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., along with good government advocacy groups MoveOn.org and Common Cause.

Others reacted with more measured tones. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said simply that she had been informed by the president of his decision by phone, adding, “the next FBI director must be strong and independent and will receive a fair hearing in the Judiciary Committee.”

One of the earliest Republican reactions came from Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn.: “While the case for removal of (FBI Director Comey) laid out by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein was thorough, his removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

News of Comey’s departure came near the end of an hourlong telephone town hall meeting that House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., was having with constituents. “Lisa in Mendham” said she wanted to know what Congress was going to do now to hold Trump accountable “for his potentially breaking the law in dealing with Russia.”

Frelinghuysen didn’t answer that question directly but gave a positive appraisal of the job Comey has done.

“He had the reputation ... like his predecessor Robert Muller, of being a sort of straight-arrow guy,” Frelinghuysen said. “I do think he was an honorable man and represented an amazing department. I'm surprised he's gone. But in this business, I guess nothing is too surprising.”

Reporters Herb Jackson and Eliza Collins contributed to this story.

WASHINGTON — After railing against FBI Director James Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, Democrats aligned with her presidential campaign reacted to his firing not with satisfaction — but with deep suspicion.

Among the former Clinton officials weighing in was her campaign manager Robby Mook. Despite frustration and disappointment over the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation, the announcement “terrifies me,” said Mook.

Twilight zone. I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me. — Robby Mook (@RobbyMook) May 9, 2017

Brian Fallon, who was a top communications official during the campaign, said he’s “not shedding any tears for Comey,” even as his firing makes him “worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now.”

I'm not shedding any tears for Comey personally -he hurt FBI's reputation- but I do worry whether we ever get to the bottom of Russia now — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) May 9, 2017

In a letter to Comey, Trump cited as cause for the FBI director’s firing his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s private email server, including public statements he made leading up to the presidential election. Yet Comey’s judgment over the email investigation has been an issue for several months. As recently as late January, Trump was seen patting Comey on the back during a White House reception to honor law enforcement officers.

What’s new is that Comey’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump campaign officials is heating up, including whether there is any evidence of collusion between the two as Russia sought to bolster Trump’s campaign and hurt Clinton’s, according to numerous U.S. intelligence agencies.

The firing also comes days after Comey testified before Congress about his handling of the email investigation during which he mistakenly stated that the FBI had obtained thousands of new emails from a former Clinton aide, Huma Abedin. While the FBI later corrected the misstatement, it appears to have given the White House an opening to fire the FBI director.

Comey came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats throughout the course of the Clinton investigation. It was days before the Nov. 8, 2016, election that Comey announced his team had found additional emails on the laptop of her aide, Huma Abedin, which the Clinton campaign blames for depressing votes in critical battlegrounds that Clinton lost to Trump by a small margin. During the hearing, Comey said he was “mildly nauseous” if his actions had any effect on the presidential election, while insisting he had no choice but to inform the public about the emails.

They also faulted Comey for speaking out about the investigation in July, when he explain why he decided against bringing charges against Clinton.

It was a break with normal FBI protocol, yet Comey may have felt pressure to speak out after former President Bill Clinton drew criticism for boarding the plane and having a private conversation with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

WASHINGTON — White House officials say President Trump based his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday on the ""clear recommendations"" of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

In a memo released Tuesday evening, Rosenstein sharply criticized the FBI chief, saying he mishandled the final stages of investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's treatment of classified State Department emails. The firing was needed to restore public confidence in the agency, Rosenstein concluded.

At the heart of the criticism: Comey's various public pronouncements about the investigation during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. On July 5, Comey held a news conference in which he said no charges would be filed against Clinton. But on Oct 28, Comey announced that the probe had been reopened to examine newly discovered emails. Then, two days before before election, Comey once again weighed in, saying the department still was not recommending charges against the former secretary of State.

Here are key points in Rosenstein's memo:

1. ""The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice. That is deeply troubling to many department employees and veterans, legislators and citizens.""

2. ""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unifies people of diverse perspectives.""

3. ""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors.""

4. ""Compounding the error: The director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

5. ""Although the president has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former department officials. The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.""

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Danny Green scored seven of his 16 points in overtime, and the San Antonio Spurs overcame an injury to Kawhi Leonard to beat James Harden and the Houston Rockets 110-107 on Tuesday night to take a 3-2 lead in their second-playoff series.

Leonard had 22 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes before exiting with an injured right ankle. Leonard stepped on Harden's foot with 5:37 left in the third quarter and then played limited minutes before sitting out overtime.

Harden had 33 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He had a chance at potential tying 3-pointer in the final seconds of OT, but was blocked from behind by Manu Ginobili.

""I know where his shot release is from,"" Ginobili said. ""I tried to bother him as much as I could. It was a risky play, but it was also risky to let him shoot.""

MANU. SEALED IT.#NBAPlayoffspic.twitter.com/0ewMHivxYY — NBA.com (@NBAcom) May 10, 2017

Aside from the block, Ginobili had 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists off the bench in the win. He also had a surprising dunk that he described as ""unexpected.""

""Manu reached back and gave us one of his Manu performances from past years,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""He was a stud.""

Game 6 is Thursday in Houston.

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

Each team stalled at the start of the extra period. Patrick Beverley made a 3-pointer with 2 minutes remaining for the first points of the period, giving Houston a 104-101 lead.

Green made a go-ahead 3-pointer and converted a three-point play to make it 109-107 Spurs with 30.1 seconds left. He also made a foul shot down the stretch to help San Antonio hold on.

""The competitiveness was off the charts,"" Popovich said. ""Either team could've won the game down the stretch.""

Two questionable plays closed regulation with the game tied at 101.

Harden was whistled for a charge after dribbling all but a few seconds off the shot clock before driving to the basket on Jonathon Simmons. The Spurs failed to take a shot on their final possession, with Patty Mills banking in a 3-pointer after the buzzer sounded.

""We let one slip away,"" Harden said. ""Execution, rebounding. Two primary things we let slip away.""

Harden also played solid defense, helping hold Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge to 15-for-42 shooting as he rotated assignments in Houston's smaller lineup. But he finished with nine turnovers.

With the Rockets leading 82-81, officials ruled a ball out of bounds on the Spurs that replays showed was actually off Harden. Beverley drained a 3-pointer on the ensuing possession, prompting San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich to scream and point at official Derrick Stafford.

The play ignited what had been a rather listless San Antonio, leading to a 10-2 run bridging the third and fourth quarters for a 92-87 lead.

The Spurs tried to exploit a size advantage over the Rockets' small lineup early, especially when Harden was guarding either Aldridge and Pau Gasol. The Spurs' big men only managed 2-for-5 shooting in the opening three minutes, leading San Antonio to abandon the strategy midway through the first quarter and sub Simmons for Gasol.

Simmons responded by scoring 10 points on 5-for-13 shooting in 26 minutes.

WASHINGTON — President Trump stunned the political world by firing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, an abrupt ending to a tenure marked by political controversies ranging from the Trump campaign's connections to Russia to Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails.

Basing his decision on the recommendations from both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump said in a statement that ""the FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement.""

The search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, the White house said.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. In a letter to Comey released by the White House, Trump agreed he ""was not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

Yet Comey's sudden dismissal calls into question the future of the investigation into Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election. The FBI is currently in the midst of a full-blown counterintelligence inquiry, exploring charges of possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

Democrats — including some who had previously attacked Comey for his handling of the Clinton probe — saw Trump's move as a blatant attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

""This is nothing less than Nixonian,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a reference to President Richard Nixon's decision in 1973 to remove the Watergate special prosecutor.

And Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's decision to fire the man overseeing a federal investigation into his campaign associates' collusion with Russia ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter.""

Schiff, whose panel is conducting a separate investigation into Russia's influence on the presidential election, called for an independent prosecutor ""to restore a modicum of public confidence — now completely lacking — that the criminal investigation will continue without further interference by the White House.""

If Trump were truly upset with Comey about his handling of the Clinton probe, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, he could have fired Comey on his first day in office. Instead, the Senate's top Democrat said, the president waited until Congress and FBI investigations into Russia heated up.

""Given the way the President has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration,"" Schumer said. Without an independent special prosecutor, he added, ""every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.""

For his part, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Trump's actions ""threaten"" the critical investigations now underway ""and the integrity and independence of the FBI.""

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

In his termination letter, Trump referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation, telling Comey he appreciated him ""informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

Still, the concern about the timing of Comey's firing was not limited to Democrats.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., who is leading the Senate panel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, said he was “troubled’’ by both the timing and reasons for Comey’s dismissal. ""I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee,’’ Burr said. “In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our committee.

“Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees,"" he continued. ""His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.”

A career prosecutor, Comey, held top Justice Department posts in the George W. Bush administration before being appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013.

He is only the second director fired in the 82-year history of the FBI. President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions in 1993 amid ethics problems. While FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms in order to make them nominally non-partisan, they can still be fired by the president.

As news of Comey's dismissal raced through Washington on Tuesday night, Republicans defended the move as difficult but necessary.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's ""decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.""

Meanwhile, Comey was apparently finding out his own employment status in an unconventional way.

Comey left Washington earlier Tuesday for a speaking engagement, and was not informed of his firing until he saw news reports of it on television while at the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, a person familiar with the matter said.

The abrupt firing came just after the FBI confirmed Comey provided erroneous testimony to a Senate panel about how Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin handled classified emails.

Notably, some of the same Democrats upset about Comey's firing have also previously called for his head, blaming Clinton's loss of the presidency on Comey's unexpected public announcement on Oct. 28 that he was re-opening the investigation into her emails.

Rosenstein, confirmed by the Senate two weeks ago as Comey's day-to-day supervisor, also faulted Comey for announcing he had re-opened the case 11 days before the election — and for his earlier July 5 news conference saying no charges would be filed against Clinton.

In a memo to the attorney general, Rosenstein said he did not understand Comey's refusal to acknowledge fault with his actions.

""Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of different perspectives,"" Rosenstein wrote.

Late Tuesday, Attorney General Sessions sent a message to the entire FBI, saying that Trump had “exercised his lawful authority to remove’’ Comey.

“By operation of law and effective immediately, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe assumed the position of acting director of the FBI,’’ Sessions wrote. “As you well know, the FBI is an exceptional law enforcement agency.

How did we get here? A James Comey timeline

Tweets fly fast and furious following firing of FBI head Comey

James Comey is one of several officials President Trump fired

Meanwhile, as Comey remains the target of public criticism over his handling of the Clinton case, the Justice Department’s inspector general is in the midst of wide-ranging review of Justice’s handling of the matter, including Comey’s leadership of it.

Last week, Comey disclosed in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had been interviewed by Justice investigators assigned to the case and expected to be questioned again.

“I have a story to tell,’’ Comey told the panel.

Comey, 56, succeeded Robert Mueller, the longest serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. Mueller served for 12 years before leaving the bureau.

A former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan and former deputy attorney general, Comey won plaudits for his independence as a key player in one of the most dramatic moments during the George W. Bush administration.

With then-Attorney General John Ashcroft hospitalized in 2004 with acute pancreatitis, Deputy Attorney General Comey rushed to his boss’ bedside at George Washington Hospital when he learned that then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andrew Card were trying to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize a controversial warrantless eavesdropping program.

Since taking office, Comey has staked out the highest profile of any director since Hoover.

In any venue, the 6-foot-8-inch Comey is hard to miss. Often referring to himself as an “awkward white guy,’’ he was anything but while delivering testimony before Congress engaging audiences in public and private forums.

Even in high-stakes congressional hearings, Comey often operated without written text and rarely sought advice from aides who accompanied him.

His public and controversial handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was only the latest in a string of public positions that the director took that did not always sit well with the White House and the Justice Department — including under Obama's administration.

He bluntly acknowledged law enforcement’s fraught relationship with the racial and ethnic communities in addresses at Georgetown University and in Birmingham, Ala., and has suggested that less-aggressive policing may be contributing to spikes in violent crime in some parts of the country—a position that put him at odds with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Obama White House.

He drew the wrath of the tech industry and privacy advocates last year as the face of the government’s legal battle with Apple Inc., to gain access to the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. With Apple insisting that creating a way to break into the device's default encryption would be tantamount to giving the FBI a ""backdoor"" that could be used to break into Apple products again and again, Comey described the dispute as the “hardest problem I’ve encountered in my entire government career.’’

At another point, Comey acknowledged the vexing nature of battling homegrown violent extremists, ticking off a list of recent bloody assaults and attempted attacks that have scarred communities across the country, from Garland, Texas to Orlando, Fla. His public concern about the FBI's capacity to confront the growing homegrown threat, prompted lawmakers to question whether the bureau had the resources to deal with it.

As the White House searches for a replacement, FBI Agents Association President Thomas O’Connor called on the Trump administration to proceed with “caution.""

“A change in FBI leadership of this magnitude must be handled carefully and with an eye towards ensuring that the bureau can continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the American public from criminal and national security threats,’’ O’Connor said.

“We greatly appreciate Director Comey’s service, leadership, and support for special agents during his tenure. He understood the centrality of the agent to the bureau's mission, recognizing that agents put their lives on the line every day. His focus was to ensure that the bureau’s investigations complied with the law and the constitution, and that agents performed their mission with integrity and professionalism. As vital stakeholders, FBI agents should be given a voice in the process of selecting the next director.”

16,What's up with Melania Trump's cyber bullying campaign? It's 'a work in progress',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In a rare campaign speech, Melania Trump said that one of her key issues as First Lady would be to combat cyber bullying Time

Melania Trump, America's historic first lady, pledged before the election that she would lead a campaign against cyber bullying.

But so far, say leaders and activists in anti-cyber bullying efforts, neither Trump nor her East Wing staff have reached out, nor have they responded to offers to help.

""I'm not seeing any movement towards an initiative that she's endorsed,"" says first lady historian Myra Gutin of Rider University in New Jersey. ""She's hired some staff but not up to the level that other first ladies have done by now.""

Trump's press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, says the anti-cyber bullying effort is still a work in progress. ""Mrs. Trump is being very thoughtful when it comes to building out her initiatives,"" Grisham said in an email. Also, her staff now numbers 10, and she's taking her time hiring because she values ""quality over quantity.""

Trump herself declined to comment, as she has routinely since she became first lady. But on Nov. 3, 2016, she attracted widespread attention when she announced in a rare speech that she would fight cyber bullying as her first-lady cause if her husband, Donald Trump, were elected.

“Technology has changed our universe. But like anything that is powerful it can have a bad side,"" she told an audience of suburban women in Berwyn, Pa. ""Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and to teenagers.”

Her declaration brought out plenty of ire on social media from those who consider Donald Trump the definition of a cyber bully given his aggressive social media attacks against anyone who piques his fury.

Lady Gaga, whose Born This Way Foundation aims to combat bullying, especially of LGBT kids, was scathing, though Gaga's representative did not return a message from USA TODAY seeking comment on how she feels about Melania Trump now.

.@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for ""anti-bullying"" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016

But there was no mocking from other anti-cyber bullying activists, who say they remain patient and hopeful that Trump will launch her initiative soon.

""We have tried to reach out to her and offer the services and expertise of our organization; so far, we have not heard back,"" says Pamela Hurst-Della Pietra, founder of the Institute of Digital Media and Child Development in New York. Still, ""I’m delighted that Melania Trump chose cyber bullying. I think she could do a tremendous amount for the children and adolescents who are suffering as a result of it.""

Since the election, excited activists have been sending Trump advice and proposals, such as holding an annual online safety summit at the White House, says Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.

""We haven’t heard anything from FLOTUS at all (so) I’m not in a position to speak to what she is or is not doing since we’re not connected yet,"" says Hinduja.

He says ""everyone in my line of work has been buzzing"" since Trump's speech. He says ""good progress"" has been made on cyber bullying over the last eight years by the White House, the Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education.

""And we’re just hoping that there will be continued and even increased support and contributions from the highest office in the land,"" he says. ""That is tremendously exciting for all of us.""

The Family Online Safety Institute welcomed Trump to the cause in December, issuing a set of recommendations such as: Inaugurating an annual Online Safety Summit at the White House; creating a chief online safety officer; and persuading the new administration to set up a $25 million research-and-education fund over five years to create educational programs for children and their parents on cyber bullying and online safety in general.

""We are still waiting to hear from her or her office about how she wishes to take this topic on,"" says Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Washington-based group. ""The only indication we’ve had is that speech before the election. And then, of course, she has mostly remained in New York. So there's not been a great deal of movement yet.

""But of those I've spoken to, including in my own organization, we’re cautiously optimistic.""

Susan Swearer, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network, says she's not been contacted by Trump's team. ""It’s such important work and there’s a huge need for creating kinder and supportive online and offline spaces, so I hope FLOTUS decides to engage in this important work,"" she says.

Donna Rice Hughes, a key figure in a 1987 political scandal that ended a Democratic presidential campaign, has been a respected leader on Internet safety for kids for more than two decades through her Enough is Enough non-profit. She endorsed Donald Trump and though she hasn't heard yet from Melania, she is convinced it will happen and that mothers especially will relate to the new FLOTUS.

""She is modeling what it means to have a balanced life and the difficulty most women who have families are having in trying to keep that all in balance,"" says Hughes. ""I am not at all concerned or surprised she's taking some time. It's very clear right now her priority is her son. She’s got four years minimum, maybe eight, to deal with cyber bullying.""

Could President Trump's online blasts undermine the first lady's cause? Possibly, says Balkam, but it would depend on the specifics of her initiative. If she focuses on, say, child-on-child cyber bullying, ""it's possible nothing he does undermines what she tries to do. But let’s wait and see.""

Combating digital bullying is not a new cause nor an inconsequential one, according to the experts and activists who have been laboring in relative obscurity for years, concerned about analysis (from the Cyberbullying Research Center in Orlando, for instance) showing that two-thirds of students who experience cyber bullying say it affected their ability to learn and feel safe at school.

Monica Lewinsky has been a recent high-profile voice on the issue: She called for an end to the ""culture of humiliation"" in a powerful TED talk in 2015. ""Cruelty is nothing new. But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible,"" she said then. ""Millions of people can stab you with their words and that's a lot of pain.""

She would seem to be a perfect ally to Melania Trump — and in fact, she defended the Trumps' young son, Barron, after he was mocked online — but her spokeswoman, Dini von Mueffling, confirmed to USA TODAY that so far Lewinsky has not heard from Trump.

all children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl #barrontrump). let's be better than this. https://t.co/CH3IfdpQpu — Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) January 23, 2017

But nothing beats a first lady's spotlight for focusing attention. So far, Trump has said nothing about cyber bullying in public, except on April 26, when she celebrated her 47th birthday at a lunch for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.

Grisham confirmed Trump mentioned cyber bullying at the lunch, thanking the group for a donation they made in her name to an anti-bullying organization, which is the tradition of the Senate spouses group for every incoming new first lady. But the lunch was closed to the media at the behest of the group so there's no official transcript.

Soon after the election, Donald Trump said his third wife would not move into the White House immediately after the inauguration; instead, she would remain in New York so that Barron, 11, could finish the school year.

Grisham maintains she's still been ""100% present"" as first lady since Jan. 20, and anyway nowadays people can work remotely from anywhere.

For comparison, Michelle Obama also said her first priority would be her children when she became first lady in 2009, though she immediately was visible and active. She did not fully launch her first initiative, her campaign for healthy eating and against childhood obesity, until nine months after she came to the White House.

""With Mrs. Trump, who's not living here yet and who's just starting to assemble her team, it may take a little longer to roll out her first initiative, but it will be done with a level of full knowledge, research and careful attention to the important data out there on this issue,"" predicts Anita McBride, who worked in multiple administrations, was former first lady Laura Bush's chief of staff and now studies the legacies of first ladies at American University in Washington.

But her absence has been noticed: Stylish and statuesque, the ex-model stands out when she is present, stimulating further curiosity about her. But she remains largely inscrutable; unlike her polished stepdaughter, businesswoman-turned-White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, Melania has not done media interviews about her plans.

Does it matter that Trump has been a slow-starting FLOTUS?

Every new first lady takes a different approach, says McBride, and it's nothing to worry about. ""We may have to get used to, with this new first lady, she's not going to do it the way her predecessors did it; she's going to do it the way it fits her best. That may be more limited but it will be just as impactful.""

First-lady expert Kate Andersen

Brower,

author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies,

says she's sympathetic to the notion that Trump needs more time to understand the job. ""While they get a honeymoon period, I think that's quickly coming to an end,"" Andersen Brower says.

Gutin suspects most people don't care, but she thinks Trump is missing an opportunity.

""The tradition is that the presidential spouse gives us some insight into the character of the president, and certainly since Jacqueline Kennedy those of us who care about it have always thought the first lady can use (the White House audience) to do a lot of good,"" Gutin says. ""Does it matter to the success of an administration? Probably not. But there is the opportunity there and she's not taking advantage of it.""

Or not yet, anyway.

9,Kawhi Leonard clarifies his Game 6 injury status after sitting out OT in Spurs win | FOX Sports,"The San Antonio Spurs found a way to win Game 5, but they seemed to take a big blow along the way.

Kawhi Leonard suffered a lower leg injury in the second half on Tuesday when he landed on James Harden’s foot, an injury that forced the two-time Defensive Player of the Year to miss San Antonio’s final possession of regulation and the entirety of overtime.

But the Spurs received some good news after the game. Leonard, who was walking with a pronounced limp, told reporters he won’t miss Game 6 on Thursday in Houston.

""Yeah, I'm gonna be able to play."" -Kawhi Leonard (ankle) #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/ZXwGtqcQMa — NBA TV (@NBATV) May 10, 2017

LEONARD: “It’s a little sore, but I mean, my teammates did a good job of closing out that game with me not being able to go that last stretch.”

REPORTER: “Is it an ankle or knee?”

LEONARD: “Ankle.” […]

REPORTER: “Pop said you wanted to play, but it was obvious that you needed to come out. How severe of an injury is it? Do you think you’ll be able to play in Game 6?”

LEONARD: “Yeah, I’m going to be able to play.”

Leonard naturally struggled for most of the second half following the injury, finishing with 22 points on 8-for-21 shooting, along with 15 rebounds and four assists.

The Spurs got a huge boost from Manu Ginobili with Leonard on the bench, as the 15-year veteran came up with a massive block on Harden on the final possession of overtime to seal San Antonio’s win.

The question now for the Spurs is how limited Leonard might be in what could be a close-out Game 6. Even before the Leonard injury, San Antonio reverted to its switch-heavy defense, rather than having its franchise player try to lock down Harden for most of the night.

If Leonard isn’t 100 percent on Thursday, it stands to reason the Spurs would use a similar defensive tactic, encouraging Harden to attack mismatches in isolation instead of running the typical Houston offense.

Either way, Game 6 should be a ton of fun.",fox-sports

Rivera (20-1) has been flawless thus far in his UFC career with four consecutive wins including a victory over new UFC Hall of Fame inductee Urijah Faber this past September.

Rivera has been clamoring for a big fight as he continues his climb up the bantamweight rankings and now he’ll face one of the most dangerous threats the divison has to offer.

And they did it with their best player in Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the entire overtime session.

Leonard suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury earlier in the game, and tried his best to play through it. But once it became clear that he couldn’t go, Gregg Popovich made the difficult decision to bench him down the stretch. Thanks to huge plays from Danny Green and Manu Ginobili — along with some brutal offensive possessions from James Harden and the Rockets, especially in overtime — San Antonio was able to win in spite of Leonard’s absence.

9,Dana White: 'There's going to be a point where I'm done' pursuing McGregor vs. Mayweather | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White committed to doing everything possible to land Conor McGregor a lucrative payday against Floyd Mayweather, but the fight is still no closer to reality.

On Saturday night after Saul “Canelo” Alvarez dished out a punishing decision in his fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., his next bout against Gennady Golovkin was announced for September 16.

That was the date originally reserved for the proposed matchup between McGregor and Mayweather, but White says he just wasn’t able to strike a deal with both sides in time so a different boxing match scooped up that Saturday on the schedule.

“The reason they got my date is because I couldn’t get my deal done on time so they got the date,” White told “The Herd” on Tuesday. “Listen, life moves on, we don’t wait for anybody. The fights are going to keep rolling. I didn’t get the deal done fast enough so I lose the date. That’s how it works.”

A date being targeted for the fight might make it appear that a deal is imminent but White says that couldn’t be further from the truth.

In fact, he says he’s no closer to closing the negotiations to put together the fight between McGregor and Mayweather and there will come a day when he is forced to give up if the two sides can’t reach an amicable agreement.

“I’m not hinting that it’s getting close at all. I knew that this thing was going to be a nightmare to get done if it can even be done. We’ll find out,” White said. “Obviously, both guys want to fight each other but what’s the deal. Can the deal be done? That’s the question.

“It’s not just Mayweather. It’s both sides of this thing are going to be hard to get done. Absolutely, there’s going to be a point where I’m done. This isn’t what I do, this isn’t my business and I’m definitely going to walk away.”

White can’t say for certain when that deadline will be reached where he’ll no longer participate in the negotiations, but he promises it could eventually happen.

As much as he wants to put the fight together for McGregor, who stands to potentially make up to nine-figures for the bout, White will eventually reach his breaking point.

“Either way, it doesn’t matter to me. I know that these two guys want to fight. I’ve said many times, I respect Conor and I’d like to do this fight for him but it’s got to be the right deal. We have to get the right deal done or it’s not going to happen,” White said. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t what I do. The UFC is what I do and I should be focusing on that and not a boxing match.

“Obviously, a lot of people want to see it, there’s a lot of interest in it, but it’s not really what I do.”",fox-sports

9,UFC finally confirms women's flyweight division launching with 'Ultimate Fighter' 26 | FOX Sports,"Let’s try this one more time.

Last week the UFC announced and then retracted plans to launch a women’s flyweight division with season 26 on “The Ultimate Fighter” with filming expected to start in July.

Now the UFC has finally rolled out the plan — again — to kick off the 125-pound women’s division with the new season of the reality show where fighters from outside the UFC as well as competitors currently on the roster can try out for the season that will crown the first ever champion.

Tryouts will be held on May 23 at the Palace Station Hotel in Las Vegas. Fighters are required to be between the ages of 21-34 with at least three fights and a winning professional record.

The stutter step for the announcement didn’t slow down the excitement for several fighters already competing in the UFC, who have already expressed interest in moving to flyweight once the division opens.

Jessica Eye, who was previously ranked as the No. 1 fighter in the world at flyweight, has already told FOX Sports that if she wins her next bout on July 7 against Aspen Ladd that she plans to move down to 125 pounds.

Former “Ultimate Fighter” competitor Bec Rawlings has also mentioned a potential move to flyweight although it doesn’t appear she’s interested in competing during another season of the reality show after already doing that once previously in her career.

Lauren Murphy has stated that she plans on gunning for a spot on the reality show with an aim to become the first ever women’s flyweight champion in the UFC.

The new season of “The Ultimate Fighter” featuring the flyweights will begin filming in July with the show airing on FS1 later this year.",fox-sports

Tensions on the Korean peninsula remain high and recent weeks have seen the US and Pyongyang trade angry rhetoric as speculation about another nuclear test grows.

Mr Moon has also vowed to unify a divided country reeling from a corruption scandal which saw his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, impeached.

In his inauguration speech, Mr Moon said he would ""do everything I can to build peace on the Korean peninsula"".

""If needed I will fly to Washington immediately,"" he said. ""I will also go to Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang in the right circumstances.""

He added that he would have ""serious negotiations"" with the US and China over the controversial deployment of anti-missile system Thaad.

North Korea has yet to officially comment on Mr Moon's victory and remarks. It had previously hinted that Mr Moon was its preferred candidate.

The 64-year-old Democratic Party candidate has also promised to bolster the economy and address youth unemployment, which are key concerns for voters.

Who is Moon?

The son of refugees from North Korea, Mr Moon served in South Korea's special forces before becoming a human rights lawyer.

Advocates greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions, in contrast to his predecessor.

Jailed while a student in the 1970s for leading protests against military ruler Park Chung-hee, Ms Park's father.

He was a top aide to former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.

Who is South Korea's new president?

Mr Moon has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations, which took a hardline stance against Pyongyang, for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.

Since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953, there have only been two summits where the leaders of the two Koreas have met, both held in Pyongyang.

Mr Moon spearheaded preparations for the second meeting in 2007, when serving as a presidential aide.

The US, South Korea's most important ally, has congratulated Mr Moon on his victory.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the US looked forward to continuing to ""strengthen the alliance"" and ""deepen the enduring friendship and partnership"".

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said their countries faced common challenges ""led by responses to the North Korean issue"" but they could ""further contribute to peace and prosperity of the region by working together"".

President Xi Jinping said he ""always attaches great importance to the relationship between China and South Korea"", and that he was ""willing to diligently work with"" with Mr Moon to ensure both countries benefit, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

9,Manu Ginobili saved the San Antonio Spurs ... and only delayed the inevitable | FOX Sports,"Unfortunately, all Ginobili did in Game 5 was delay the inevitable.

This Rockets-Spurs series has perfectly illustrated San Antonio's shortcomings in a potential Western Conference finals series against the Golden State Warriors. It's not that the Spurs lack athleticism, although that will be a problem against the back-to-back NBA Finals.

And it's not that the Spurs are doomed from behind the arc. San Antonio can chuck with the best of them. If they take care of business against Houston (no sure thing, to be sure) and keep the pace slow against Golden State, the Spurs might be able to hang around.

The problem continues to be LaMarcus Aldridge. Outside of a spectacular Game 3 performance, the Spurs big man is borderline unplayable against precise offensive teams that move the ball and look for the best shot.

He's the reason San Antonio keeps switching all of its pick-and-rolls, instead of fighting through screens and having Kawhi guard Harden one-on-one. Aldridge simply doesn't have the ability to jump out, corral the ball-handler, and recover to his man in time. He never has.

So the Spurs have made a conscious decision to switch everything, keeping shooters in front of them and goading Harden into trying to beat Aldridge off the dribble in isolation. It's probably the right play, assuming Leonard doesn't have the energy to carry San Antonio on offense and wreak complete havoc on every defensive possession.",fox-sports

6,Trump on Comey firing: 'They will be thanking me',"Story highlights Trump said his dismissal of Comey would be validated after ""things calm down""

Senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump defended his abrupt decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, saying on Wednesday his decision will be seen in a better light after the furious controversy dies down.

At one point in a series of tweets, Trump said his dismissal of Comey -- who came under withering criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation -- would be validated after ""things calm down.""

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" Trump tweeted.

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

He led off the tweetstorm with criticism of Democrats, who have loudly called for a special prosecutor to look into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia. Democrats -- and some Republicans -- were quick on Tuesday to claim that Trump was ridding himself of an investigator who was delving too deeply into ties between his associates and Russia.

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" Trump wrote.

6,America's new post-Comey reality,"It leaves the nation confronting complicated questions about the relationship between government and independent law enforcement, the nature of Trump's use of power and possibly even the integrity of the presidency itself.

Trump already had Washington on edge three months into his term. But his sudden strike against Comey was unconventional even by his own standards, and immediately and significantly exacerbated the discord that has raged since he took office. It may also have delivered another damaging blow to his own viability and the goodwill he needs to build a successful presidency.

As a shocked Washington digested the implications of Trump's political decapitation of Comey, accusations from Trump critics began to fly, and his defenders struggled to summon effective counterattacks.

But this was not just politics as usual. Something very significant had just occurred: The President fired an FBI chief overseeing a probe into claims his own campaign colluded with Russia to meddle in last year's election.

FBI directors always serve at the pleasure of the President. But it was those circumstances that left everyone breathless.

""I think it is profoundly troubling for our democracy,"" CNN's senior political analyst David Gergen said. ""(Trump) may not mean to, but he is giving the impression that he thinks danger is getting too close.""

Whatever that turns out to be true or not, Trump's move raised several possibilities, neither of which are likely to end well for him.

First, there is the question of whether Comey firing marks a deliberate attempt to disrupt the Russia investigation -- which would potentially amount to an abuse of power.

Alternatively, Comey's dismissal made quickly on Tuesday afternoon following a Justice Department recommendation, will appear to be an impulsive swipe made with little forethought and or insight into consequences that hint at gross political negligence.

Historical precedent?

News of Trump's breathtaking decision broke just before 6 p.m. ET after a comparatively normal Tuesday in Washington, which was digging in for the GOP's long campaign to navigate an Obamacare repeal bill through the Senate.

Everyone was left groping for a historical precedent and had the same thought at once: Watergate.

Trump's dismissal of Comey brought to mind President Richard Nixon's order for Attorney General Eliot Richardson to sack special prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973 -- a move that unleashed political forces that would eventually bring him down in disgrace. (Richardson and a deputy refused and resigned instead.)

""The only historical parallel is the Saturday Night Massacre,"" CNN Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said.

JUST WATCHED Comey's firing compared to Nixon 'massacre' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comey's firing compared to Nixon 'massacre' 01:13

CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin accused Trump of a ""grotesque abuse of power.""

Most immediately, the firing of Comey spurs questions about the future course of the investigation into Russia election interference.

After all, the President will now have to nominate a new director changed with overseeing the investigation into his own associates -- raising immediate questions over the new FBI boss' independence.

Those who see a nefarious hand in the firing will note that every investigation into the Russia issue -- in the FBI and in Congress, will now be overseen by a Trump appointee or a Republican.

And any new FBI chief nominated by Trump -- who vowed Wednesday to replace Comey with ""someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI"" -- is now guaranteed a rocky and acrimonious confirmation process.

The rationale for the firing of Comey is also set to come under intense security.

JUST WATCHED Fallon calling for special counsel at DOJ Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fallon calling for special counsel at DOJ 01:25

The rationale

Newly confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein laid out a charge sheet related to Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation which many Democrats believe cost their candidate the presidency last year.

Yet Comey's actions -- including publicly upbraiding the former secretary of state for her stewardship of classified information even though she was not charged -- were raucously backed by Trump on the campaign trail.

And Trump's team has never shown anything but contempt for Clinton's complaints about the way the email saga derailed her campaign.

So the idea that the President was suddenly motivated by a desire to clean up that episode seems far fetched.

Even if he was, critics want to know why Comey was fired on Tuesday with new questions about Russia swirling around the White House and not as soon as Trump took office.

The fate of the FBI investigation itself must also now be in question.

Despite Democratic antipathy, Comey still boasted a reputation for integrity. Amid the congressional shenanigans over the Russia matter, Comey's was easily the most authoritative voice. When he announced during a Capitol Hill hearing two months ago that his agents were probing for any links between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives, it put a much more serious cast on the entire episode.

Now that voice is silent.

Brookings Institution scholars Benjamin Wittes and Susan Hennessey, who is also a CNN analyst, said Tuesday's events raised profound legal and ethical issues.

""There's also no question that removing the FBI director in the midst of a high-stakes investigation of Russian influence in the inner circle of the President's campaign and White House is a horrifying breach of every expectation we have of the relationship between the White House and federal law enforcement,"" they wrote on the Lawfare blog.

Comey's dismissal and the administration's motivation will inject a new and time consuming new element into congressional probes into the Russia affair.

Investigations in the House and Senate, struggling with a mountain of evidence and political infighting had already looked to stretch on for months. Now they seem all but inevitable to stretch into next year least before they find answers.

Political implications

Then there are the political implications unleashed by Trump's move for the White House itself.

The Russia drama has hounded this administration even before its first days in office, over claims of Moscow's interference in the election, Trump's affinity for President Vladimir Putin and ties to Moscow of aides like sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

Now it seems unlikely that the suspicions and accusation will ever go away and seem certain to inflict new damage on Trump's already compromised approval ratings.

At early on the White House seemed unprepared for the firestorm that quickly came its way on Tuesday evening.

Administration officials fanned out to talk to reporters outside the presidential mansion and headed to cameras to go on cable networks.

On CNN, Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway told Anderson Cooper ""this has nothing to do with Russia.""

""Somebody must be getting $50 every time (Russia) is said on TV ... (This) has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the President's confidence and can faithfully execute his duties,"" she said.

On Wednesday, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will face a test of fire at the podium in the White House briefing room. One question she will face is whether the administration is seeking to close down the Russia probes.

After all, Comey is not the first to be shown the door for at least appearing to pose a threat to the White House.

On Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to senators about how she was fired days after warning that Flynn could be compromised by Russia. The administration insists she was dismissed for refusing to implement Trump's travel ban on residents of seven Muslim nations.

Preet Bharara, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who had jurisdiction over the area of Trump Tower, was also fired by the President.

The White House meanwhile appears at the very least to have sought to sow distraction in the House intelligence committee investigation into Russian election meddling -- which ended with the chairman of the panel, GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, having to step down with his independence besmirched.

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly spoken and tweeted in a manner that suggests he is trying to discredit the investigations.

""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" Trump tweeted the day before firing Comey.

While none of these examples proves clear wrongdoing by the White House, together they add up to a pattern that is fuels suspicion among Trump critics.

Major challenge

One major challenge for the White House now will be to solidify support among Republicans and head off Democratic claims that a special prosecutor or independent probe into the Russian evidence is now inevitable.

Some Republicans, like Sens. Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, did initially take the administration's rationale for dismissing Comey at face value.

But others are wavering.

Sen. Richard Burr, who chairs the Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian election meddling, expressed extreme concern over Tuesday's events.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" the North Carolina Republican said in a statement.

Other Republicans struggled to make sense of the White House's behavior.

""Regardless of how you think Director Comey handled the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle, the timing of this firing is very troubling,"" said GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska.

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake meanwhile tweeted: ""I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just can't do it.""",cnn
6,"They were investigating Trump, and then they were fired","(CNN) After President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, questions immediately arose about the President's motivations for his dismissal -- and for the recent firings of two other then-President Barack Obama-appointees who were in the middle of conducting investigations linked to Trump.

""They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. And they fired James Comey , the very man leading he investigation. This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" Schumer said shortly after the announcement, calling for a special independent prosecutor into the Trump campaign's ties to the Kremlin.

""Any person who he appoints to lead the Russian investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey,"" he said.

CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was ""absurd.""

Toobin branded the move a ""grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States,"" comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.

James Comey

Then-FBI Director James Comey testifies in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee during an oversight hearing on Capitol Hill May 3, 2017 in Washington, DC.

The FBI director saw his reputation compromised when he became embroiled in the 2016 election campaign. He was first criticized by Republicans when he announced he wouldn't be charging then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her emails, and then by Democrats for publicly reopening the case days before Americans went to the polls.

Why was he fired?

The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that the erstwhile director was ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

What was he investigating?

As head of the FBI, he was overseeing the investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to the Kremlin. Democrats have ridiculed the notion that the Clinton issue is what truly prompted Comey's dismissal, drawing parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggesting Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe.

Where is the investigation now?

At a hearing last week, Comey confirmed that the FBI's investigation into accusations of coordination between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian officials was continuing. It's not clear if the incoming FBI director will pick up where Comey left off.

Sally Yates

Former US Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates testifies before the Senate Judicary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Capitol Hill May 8.

Appointed by Obama, former Deputy Attorney General Yates had been running Trump's Justice Department as Acting Attorney General while Trump's nominee for the role, Sen. Jeff Sessions, awaited confirmation. She became a household name when Trump abruptly removed her from the temporary position.

Why was she fired?

Ostensibly for her refusal to implement the first iteration of Trump's ban on travelers from a number of Muslim-majority countries.

""The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement at the time, explaining the President's actions.

What was she investigating?

As part of the probe into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump administration, then-acting Attorney General Yates met with White House counsel to inform them that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn wasn't telling the truth about his interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and, as a result, represented a blackmail risk.

""We believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,"" Yates said in a Senate subcommittee hearing aimed at gathering details of the Russian hacking of the 2016 election on Monday in Washington.

""Logic would tell you that you don't want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,"" she added.

Where is the investigation now?

Yates said Monday that she warned the White House earlier this year that former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be ""essentially blackmailed by the Russians.""

Preet Bharara

Preet Bharara, then-US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in June 2016.

Preet Bharara, former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was known as one of Wall Street's fiercest watchdogs and a widely respected prosecutor.

Why was he fired?

Bharara first refused to resign along with 46 US attorneys across the country. Although it is common for incoming administrations to replace district attorneys when transitioning to power, Trump had previously assured Bharara that he'd keep his job.

Sources told CNN that Bharara had been told after a meeting with Trump in November that he could stay on, and that he felt blindsided by the request. He was fired after refusing to comply.

At the time, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren posted a series of tweets suggesting Bharara was removed in part because he ""had authority over Trump Tower.""

Bharara suggested that this was indeed the case. ""I wanted it to be on record that there was a deliberate decision to change (his) mind and fire me, particularly given what my office's jurisdiction is,"" he said.

What was he investigating?

Bharara's office had many investigations ongoing at the time of his firing, including one involving Trump favorite Fox News

And then there's the President's claim that he was wiretapped in Trump Tower on orders of then-President Obama, whose investigation led back to the Southern District of New York.

""Trump has undoubtedly decided that he wants his own pick rather than the choice of Senate adversary (and minority leader) Chuck Schumer in place as the top federal prosecutor in New York,"" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan wrote in March.

6,Here is who Trump could pick to replace Comey,"(CNN) By firing FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, President Donald Trump has created a near-impossible standard for his replacement.

Some Republicans, in an attempt to protect Trump's decision to fire Comey in the midst of his investigation into Trump associates, Russia and the 2016 election, argued that his replacement will have to be someone who has unquestionable credibility with a deep background in law enforcement matters.

Democrats agree, but argue Trump's next FBI director must also have no connections to Trump politically or professionally, making it impossible for anyone to question the next director's conflict of interest.

Working in Trump's favor is the fact that his next FBI director only needs 51 votes to get through the Senate.

Here's a list of people Trump could pick to replace Comey:

Rudy Giuliani

Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, would likely be among Trump's top choices for FBI director, given his loyalty to the President and law enforcement background.

But his vocal advocacy for Trump during the 2016 campaign and clear partisan bent would make it nearly impossible for the former New York mayor to get confirmed by the Senate, even if he only needed 51 votes.

Giuliani's record is chock full of anti-Hillary Clinton comments, too.

""When I see her, I see her in an orange jumpsuit, I'm sorry,"" he said days before the 2016 election. ""Or at least a striped one.""

Chris Christie

Christie is in the same boat as Giuliani.

The New Jersey governor was one of the first top flight Republicans to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign and stood by him during some of the most trying times in his presidential campaign. His loyalty was rewarded by summarily being fired from the Trump transition, in large measure because of he, as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, put Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's father in jail.

But Christie has remained loyal to Trump and was appointed to lead the President's opioid and drug abuse commission earlier this year. He has a law enforcement background and would be close to Trump.

But like Giuliani, he is clearly partisan.

""Is she guilty or not guilty,"" the former federal prosecutor bellowed during the 2016 Republican National Convention after talking about Clinton's character and judgment. The crowd then chanted, ""Lock her up,"" which Christie egged on.

Ray Kelly

Should Trump consider Kelly, the former commissioner of the New York City Policy Department, it wouldn't be the first time the long-time New Yorker was mentioned as a possible candidate for FBI director.

The New York Times reported in 1993, after Kelly first severed as commissioner of the NYPD after the World Trade Center bombing, that the former police cadet ""has been mentioned as a possible replacement"" for the FBI under then-President Bill Clinton.

Kelly didn't become FBI director. That job went to Louis Freeh.

But the fact he was considered by Clinton, a Democrat, gets to one of Kelly's strongest suits: Possible bipartisan support.

Kelly held two jobs under Clinton: Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at Treasury and Commissioner of the United States Customs service.

And he has deep law enforcement credentials: He served a NYPD commissioner for 13 years, longer than anyone in history.

John Pistole

Pistole, currently the president of Anderson University in Indiana, is another example of someone who could curry bipartisan support.

Pistole, who last served as the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration under President Barack Obama, also served as deputy director of the FBI under former president George W. Bush.

He joined the FBI in 1983, serving at the bureau for 26 years until he was confirmed as TSA head in July 2010. While at the FBI he also worked at the bureau's Executive Assistant Director for national security.

Pistole would be a more establishment pick, given his work on terrorism policy during both the Bush and Obama administrations.

Unlike other options on this list, it is unclear whether Pistole backed a presidential candidate in 2016.

The former TSA head has commented on some Trump policies, though.

After Trump planned to cut the ""armed pilot"" program, training that was developed after 9/11 to prepare pilots and crew for a highjacking scenario, Pistole told The Washington Post that he disagreed.

""If you were on one of the four hijacked planes on 9/11, you'd sure say it was important,"" he said. ""To me, it's a relatively small investment for the potential for the risk-mitigation value. It's all about how much risk do you want to take on. I would advocate for a reduction in that program but not elimination.""

Andrew McCabe

McCabe would likely be the easiest pick, given he is currently working at the acting director of the FBI and had served as Comey's deputy since early February 2016.

He joined the FBI as a special agent in 1996 and has since worked in on a host of issues, including counterterrorism, national security and interrogation.

McCabe's biggest drawback could be his connection to Comey and the fact that he had his hands in both the FBI's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election and was inside the bureau during the investigation into Clinton's emails, which Trump said in a letter Tuesday led to the FBI directors dismissal.

Trey Gowdy

Picking Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican and former federal prosecutor, would electrify Trump's Republican base.

Almost immediately after Comey's departure went public, right-wing blogs and websites jumped at the chance to push Gowdy, who became a champion of the right when he led the committee looking into Clinton's handling of the 2012 Benghazi attack.

Several blogs even started petitions urging Trump to appoint Gowdy director of the FBI.

Gowdy was critical of Comey's decision not to prosecute Clinton over her use of a private email server, but said in the wake of his firing that the former FBI director ""had a very difficult job.""

Like Giuliani and Christie, it would be difficult for Trump to confirm Gowdy, given his clear partisan bent and the fact he endorsed the President during the 2016 Republican primary.",cnn
6,Firing James Comey is Donald Trump's most unpredictable and dangerous move yet,"(CNN) James Comey found out he had been fired as FBI director just like the rest of us: By watching it on television.

The move, announced late Tuesday via a letter sent from President Donald Trump to Comey, marked the most unpredictable moment of a presidency that through its first 100-plus days has been the least orthodox in memory. It also ramped up criticism of Trump's judgments -- Comey was tasked with leading the investigation into Russia's meddling into the 2016 campaign and what, if any, collusion had occurred between Trump campaign operatives and Russian intelligence officials -- and left official Washington reeling over a move considered unthinkable as recently as this week.

The explanation for the move, which emerged into the stunned silence it caused, made little logical sense. A report from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein highlighted Comey's handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server as the main reason for his dismissal. Rosenstein accused Comey of an attempt to ""usurp"" the power of the attorney general by announcing publicly that he didn't believe any charges should be brought against Clinton in a July 5, 2016 press conference.

JUST WATCHED Who is James Comey? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is James Comey? 01:05

""Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein added. ""The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.""

That echoes criticism launched by Democrats loyal to Clinton, who insisted that Comey's decision to offer his own unvarnished view of Clinton's conduct vis-a-vis her private email server -- he said she had been ""extremely careless"" -- went well beyond his proscribed duties.",cnn
6,"Post-Comey: 3 ways to investigate the Trump campaign and Russia, explained","President Donald Trump's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey Tuesday triggered renewed demands from lawmakers, former government officials and watchdog groups for an ""independent"" investigation into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

For months, some have argued for the appointment of a "" special"" counsel or prosecutor , while others want to form a congressional "" select committee ,"" and a third group suggests launching a new bipartisan commission . While none of these options are mutually exclusive, there are, however, significant differences in the purpose, scope and viability of these approaches.

Here's a breakdown of the various paths available and how they differ:

Special counsel

Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided in March to recuse himself from any existing or future investigations related to Trump's presidential campaign ( or transition ) after reports surfaced that Sessions had met with a Russian diplomat last year. As a result of Sessions' recusal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is now overseeing the FBI's investigation into whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in election.

The attorney general's regulations provide for appointment of outside "" special counsel "" in certain circumstances, including if handling by the Justice Department would ""present a conflict of interest for the department or other extraordinary circumstances,"" and if ""it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside special counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.""

In light of Sessions' recusal, however, the decision to appoint a special counsel in this case will rest solely with Rosenstein.

And while lawmakers on Capitol Hill have no role in the appointment of any special counsel, that hasn't stopped top Democratic leadership from putting pressure on Rosenstein to appoint someone else in his place.

""Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein sat in the Judiciary Committee and promised to appoint a special prosecutor at the appropriate time,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. ""That time is right now. The American people's trust in our criminal justice system is in Rosenstein's hands. Mr. Rosenstein, America depends on you to restore faith in our criminal justice system, which is going to be badly shattered after the administration's actions today.""

Experts say the main purpose of a special counsel in the Russia situation would be the pursuit of an independently driven criminal investigation.

""They can utilize a grand jury, they can ask to return indictments, they would be empowered to pick staff (of their choosing), and provided with a budget to carry out responsibilities,"" said attorney Richard Ben-Veniste, who served as the former chief of the Watergate Special Prosecutor's Watergate Task Force and on the bipartisan 9/11 Commission.

In other words, the goal of an investigation conducted by a special counsel ""is not to answer public questions about what happened or what may still be happening,"" as Wittes wrote in a post on Lawfare , but rather to conduct ""a set of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence investigations that may (or may not) have criminal investigative elements.""

Select committee

While a number of House and Senate committees are currently examining Russian interference in the election, Arizona Sen. John McCain and other outside experts have specifically called for a ""select committee,"" with new members hand-picked by current congressional leadership.

In the immediate aftermath of Comey's firing, such calls grew louder.

""I have long called for a special congressional committee to investigate Russia's interference in the 2016 election,"" McCain said in a statement Tuesday. ""The President's decision to remove the FBI Director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.""

Advantages of using such a select committee include newly dedicated staff with sufficient expertise and time, subpoena power to compel testimony and documents, and ideally, implementation without the arguable taint of influence by the White House -- an accusation that has besieged existing structures like the House intelligence committee's investigation.

While both a special counsel and a select committee could employ certain investigative functions, Wittes cautions that they serve different purposes: The special prosecutor function is ""designed to prosecute crimes,"" whereas a select committee is ""designed to do an investigation so that Congress would know how to pursue it's constitutional functions.""

But Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, said the choice between a special counsel and a select committee ""shouldn't be either/or,"" despite the fact that ""there are somewhat different interests being protected"" -- both approaches are useful ""given that the stakes are so high here.""

Bipartisan commission

On the other end of the spectrum, some have called for a new bipartisan independent commission to investigate Russia's influence on the election, much in the same vein as the 9/11 Commission.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who sits on the House intelligence committee, accused the White House in March of ""obstructing"" the panel's investigation, and called repeatedly for an independent commission to review the matter.

The @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse is obstructing Congress's #RussianHacking investigation. Ind. Commission is only path to find the truth. https://t.co/TNa370VdT2 — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) March 27, 2017

The purpose of such a commission is distinct from a criminal investigation, as its goal would be ""inform the legislature or the public about something that happened,"" Wittes said. ""The purpose of the 9/11 Commission was to tell the story of how we got to this point.""

""The advantage is that it's flashy and very independent,"" but it's ""not well-positioned to litigate"" without certain investigative powers, Wittes added.

The other downside of an independent commission is that it would require legislation to enact, which could prove challenging in the current political climate.

If used, ""it would no doubt be the result of substantial public pressure on Congress and the President, but it seems unlikely at this point,"" Ben-Veniste said.",cnn
3,Trump says he will be 'thanked' for firing of FBI chief Comey,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

Democratic and Republican lawmakers will be ""thanking"" Donald Trump for firing FBI director James Comey, the president has said.

In early morning tweets, Mr Trump defended his shock decision to fire the FBI chief over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails.

His comments come just before he is set to meet the Russia's foreign minister.

Mr Comey was leading an FBI investigation into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI,"" Mr Trump said in defending his decision on Wednesday.

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" he added.

The president and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday morning.

The White House shocked Washington and Democrats were quick to link the firing of Mr Comey to the Russia investigation.

It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.

Why was James Comey fired?

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the department of justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Mrs Clinton's emails, given that Mr Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.

But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"".

""Almost everyone agrees the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.""

Mr Rosenstein also said:

Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 when he announced the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution

That he had compounded his error by ""gratuitously"" releasing ""derogatory information"" about Mrs Clinton

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.

The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.

What about the Russia investigation?

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations but no conclusions have yet been reached.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

Mr Trump responded on Twitter that Mr Schumer had recently expressed his lack of confidence in the FBI chief.

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior justice department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comey explains why he went public reopening Clinton email probe

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

What was Clinton FBI probe about?

He told the Senate last week it had made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Mrs Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Mr Comey.

He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.

Watergate 2.0?

Image copyright AP Image caption Nixon became the only US president to resign from the job

In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington. The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters.

The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Mr Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up.

""Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him,"" the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday.

Mr Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. He later became the only US president to resign.

6,No charges over 2015 Conservative battle bus cases,"Image copyright PA

No Conservatives will face charges for breaches of expenses rules over the 2015 general election ""battle bus"".

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had examined files from 14 police forces and while there was evidence of inaccurate spending returns it did not ""meet the test"" for further action.

It is still investigating the Conservative campaign in South Thanet.

The Conservatives said the allegations had been ""politically motivated"" and a ""waste of police time"".

The inquiry related to claims some ""battle bus"" campaigning costs in the 2015 election were wrongly recorded.

It was alleged the party spent tens of thousands of pounds on local campaigns - including on ""battle bus"" visits by activists - which were either not declared or were wrongly registered as national spending.

Under complex election spending rules, parties must disclose national spending separately from money used to promote each candidate, and separate national and local limits apply.

In March the Tories were fined a record £70,000 by the Electoral Commission, which criticised the party for resisting its investigation although it was unable to prove any intention to make false declarations.

But following a lengthy investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would take no further action against either candidates or party officials.

It said a file from Kent Police on the South Thanet campaign was recently received and was ""under consideration"", adding that nothing should be inferred from the fact that its inquiries were continuing.

A decision on whether to bring charges is likely to be made before the General Election, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw understands.

'Insufficient evidence'

In a statement, the CPS said it was an offence to knowingly make a false declaration but in order to bring charges it must be proved that suspects knew the return was inaccurate and acted dishonestly in signing the declaration.

""Although there is evidence to suggest the returns may have been inaccurate, there is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard that any candidate or agent was dishonest,"" said its head of special crime Nick Vamos.

Submitting inaccurate returns relating to battle bus spending was a ""technical offence"", Mr Vamos said, but he did not believe in the circumstances it was in the public interest to bring charges against individuals.

Speaking at an event in Nottingham, Prime Minister Theresa May said the Tories had believed all along local expenses had been properly reported and declared.

All the major parties had been fined for mistakes on national expenses, she said. ""We've paid our fines, and I sincerely hope the other parties are paying theirs.""

Conservative Party chairman Patrick McLoughlin said the party regretted the police had become involved.

Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning

""These were politically motivated and unfounded complaints that have wasted police time,"" he said.

The Electoral Commission said the CPS's findings were consistent with its own investigation, which had found the Conservative's spending return was incomplete and inaccurate.

The allegations came to light following an investigation by Channel 4 News and the Daily Mirror.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""surprised"" by the ruling and would ""look into the details"". While he respected the independence of the Crown Prosecution Service, he said the electoral laws had to be adhered to and enforced.

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the Tories had ""driven a battle bus and horses"" through the spirit of the law.

One Conservative MP investigated by the police, Karl McCartney, called on senior officials at the Electoral Commission to resign.

Describing the watchdog as ""unfit for purpose"", Mr McCartney - who is seeking re-election in Lincoln - said unless senior figures took responsibility he would campaign for the quango's abolition after the general election.",bbc-news

DJ Robert Miles, best known for his trance hit Children, has died at the age of 47 after a short illness.

The Italian musician topped the charts in 12 countries with the track, which was first released in 1995 and reached number two in the UK in 1996.

Miles's radio station OpenLab confirmed he died ""after a courageous battle with stage four metastatic cancer"".

Pete Tong led the tributes to the DJ, tweeting: ""Sad to hear Robert Miles passing. RIP, thanks for the music.""

Singer Boy George wrote: ""R.I.P Robert Miles. Very sad news!""

The news was broken by producer and longtime friend Joe T Vannelli, who said: ""The tragic news of the death of a very talented artist of our time makes me incredulous and upset.

""I will miss the fights, brawls, criticism, judgements but especially your talent in finding sounds and melodies unparalleled.""

""Children is an instrumental and dance anthem, one of the most ever loved tracks. With Robert Miles a part of my life dies with him.""

Miles was born Roberto Concina in Switzerland on 3 November 1969 to Italian parents.

'Thanks for the inspiration'

After finding mainstream success with Children, he had two further UK top 10 singles - Fable and One & One - and went on to release five albums.

Miles also launched a Balearic radio station Open Lab in 2012, which plays experimental music.

In a statement, the station said: ""Robert was more than just an artist, he was a pioneer, a creator, an inspiration, a son, a father, our friend.""

It added: ""Throughout [his illness] he was strong, determined, incredibly brave and did everything he could to fight this horrendous disease.""

Other figures in the dance music community to pay tribute included Darude, who tweeted: ""RIP Robert Miles. Thank you for the inspiration, direction & courage!""

Armin van Buuren said: ""Really in shock to hear the news of the passing of Robert Miles,"" while Chicane wrote: ""I only played 'Children' 2 weeks ago on Sun:sets.... I wished I had written it.""

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The 2016 campaign apparently isn't over yet.

Six months after Election Day, President Trump's stunning decision to fire FBI Director James Comey thrust questions about the campaign that put Trump in the White House back at center stage. Democrats and a handful of Republicans are pressing demands that a special prosecutor be appointed to pursue an independent investigation into Russian meddling in the election, including whether Trump associates colluded with them.

Now the issue of what Moscow did and who may have helped — for months an annoying background noise for Trump — has become the loudest clamor in the capital. The president's action, taken after tweets dismissing the investigation and demanding it be shut down, has ignited a firestorm of criticism, drawn comparisons to Richard Nixon, and sparked talk of a constitutional crisis. At least for now, it is likely to complicate and delay the administration's governing agenda, from health care to tax cuts.

5 key points in memo calling for FBI Director James Comey's firing

Clinton officials respond to Comey firing with suspicion, not satisfaction

Analysis: James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia

What it will not do is squelch the appetite for investigation.

If anything, scrutiny now expands to include the decision to fire Comey. And critics note that Trump already has fired two other officials who happened to be involved in potentially troublesome investigations — former acting attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who had reported concerns about Flynn to the Trump White House, and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, another holdover whose investigations touched Trump associates.

""EVERYONE who cares about independence & rule of law in America should be ""troubled by the timing and reasoning"" of Comey firing. Period,"" Bharara tweeted Tuesday night. He was quoting Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C.

The fury of the reaction seemed to surprise the White House, given Democrats' criticism of Comey for his public accounts of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State. Clinton herself last week blamed Comey and the Russians for costing her the White House.

After Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters he wondered whether investigations into the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia were ""getting too close for the president,"" Trump derided him as ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer.""

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" he tweeted Wednesday morning. He retweeted a link to a Drudge Report story headlined, ""10 SCANDALS ON DIRECTOR'S WATCH."" The president predicted that ""Republican and Democrat alike"" eventually ""will be thanking me.""

Still, in one more sign that the White House may be misjudging the optics involved, the president was scheduled to meet at the White House Wednesday morning with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

""It's time to move on,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Fox News.

That's not likely to happen.

After the rockiest opening months of any modern president, and the lowest approval ratings, Trump on Day 110 created his biggest controversy to date. Comey is just the second FBI director ever to be fired. (William Sessions was the first, ousted by Bill Clinton after allegations of financial improprieties.) Trump is the first president to fire a law-enforcement official investigating him since Richard Nixon ordered aides to fire Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor.

""Nixon, in his memoirs, said that the 'firestorm' that met the Saturday Night Massacre was the first glimpse that he had of how the acid of Watergate had eaten away at his presidency, and eroded his powers,"" says John Farrell, author of an acclaimed new biography, Nixon: A Life. ""It is conceivable that Americans have become so cynical as to shrug all this off, as Trump hopes, but I tend to believe that this ongoing drip, drip, drip will have a corrosive effect on the Trump presidency, similar to that of Watergate on Nixon.""

In 1974, Nixon would resign in the face of impeachment. The Nixon Library and Museum posted a wry tweet Tuesday night: ""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian.""

WASHINGTON — As calls for an independent prosecutor intensify on both sides of the aisle, President Trump and aides argued Wednesday that the firing of FBI Director James Comey had nothing to do with the agency's ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" Trump tweeted.

The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, speaking on MSNBC's Morning Joe and other television news programs, said the FBI director's overall record subjected him to dismissal. Sanders cited the recommendations of Justice Department leaders who said Comey had lost his effectiveness as the bureau's leader — in part because of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Comey announced just 11 days before the November presidential election that he was reopening the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. As Sanders noted in her interview defending the firing, many Democrats blamed for her loss to Trump in the November election.

Stressing the Trump administration has no plans to get involved in FBI business, Sanders said the Russia investigations will ""continue whether Jim Comey is there or not.""

That did little to assuage the concerns of Democrats, who united in their calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the Russia probe — and even some Republicans on Wednesday began to broach the idea.

James Comey's firing won't end election controversy over Russia

Disputing Trump's reasoning on the timing, Democrats insisted that Trump could have fired Comey over his handling of the Clinton investigation anytime during the past four months he's been in office. Instead, they said, the president waited until the various Russia investigations heated up. ""He feels the noose tightening,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, also speaking on Morning Joe.

Kaine noted that, in Trump's termination letter to Comey, the president thanked the FBI director for ""you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

As Kaine put it: ""That shows a deeply insecure president.""

As many Democrats described the Comey dismissal as ""Nixonian,"" in reference to President Richard Nixon's firing of the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973, there could be some Republican support for an independent investigation. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., told MSNBC that Comey's firing makes it ""hard to resist"" calls for a special prosecutor. ""It's pretty tough to fire the guy who's investigating your campaign,"" Dent said.

Other Republicans joined in the criticism of the timing of Trump's stunning move.

Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., heading up one of the investigations as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he is ""troubled by the timing and reasoning"" of Comey's firing. He added that it ""further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.""

Trump, of course, doesn't see it that way. During his morning tweet storm, Trump said that ""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!""

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

The president said he will hire someone ""who will do a far better job"" in restoring the FBI's prestige.

The new director will inherit an ongoing investigation into whether there was any collusion between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian who sought to influence last year's election by hacking Democrats close to Clinton and releasing the stolen information to websites such as WikiLeaks.

The investigation focuses on whether there are any Russian links to Trump associates Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager; Carter Page, a member of a Trump foreign policy advisory board; and Roger Stone, a long-time friend and political adviser to Trump.

Manafort, Page, and Stone have all denied collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.

Trump's decision to fire Comey comes amid a flood of news about the Russia investigation. On Monday, Sally Yates, the acting attorney general Trump fired earlier in his term, told a Senate panel that she warned the White House that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied about contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and was therefore vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Trump later fired Flynn.

White House officials downplayed the timing of all these developments, however, insisting that the same Democrats condemning the decision have in the past called for Comey's removal over his handling of last year's Clinton email investigation.

In the report that Trump used to justify his decision, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a July 5 news conference to announce that charges would not be filed against Clinton, even as he criticized her over the handling of classified information. “We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein said. His letter recommending firing also specifically mentioned Comey's decision to announce new investigation in the Clinton investigation on October 28.

Trump, meanwhile, had praised Comey for re-opening the investigation in October – and has in the months since complimented the FBI director. Introducing Comey during a White House event in January, Trump said that ""he's become more famous than me.""

At the White House, Trump's relatively light public schedule guarantees that questions about Russia will continue to be front and center.

The president is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. It's the only event on his public schedule so far.

After a State Department meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Lavrov laughed off questions about the Comey firing and the Russia investigation.

""Was he fired?"" Lavrov told reporters. ""You're kidding? You're kidding?""

The larger question is whether we are officially turning into a banana republic.

President Donald Trump speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House on May 4. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images)

President Trump is always transparent in his peculiar way. Even as he lies baldly, he reveals what is on the forefront of his mind. So it is in the brutal letter he had a top personal aide hand deliver to the FBI, firing director James Comey: “While I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau.”



Of course, we do not know if Trump is or is not under investigation. We certainly cannot take Trump’s word for it. We do know for a fact that the FBI is looking into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible involvement — links, coordination, collusion — by Trump aides and associates. By pushing Comey out the door, and doing so on the preposterous pretext that the FBI director mishandled the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server last July 5, Trump has plunged the country into nothing less than a constitutional crisis. How it is resolved will have profound implications for our future.



An obvious and key question is whether by getting rid of Comey, Trump will succeed in slowing or bringing to a halt the investigative machinery presently in motion. On its face, that seems unlikely. If the workings of the FBI are always a black box, that is especially so for a leaderless bureau, run by a toothless acting director. It is conceivable that Trump’s replacement for Comey, whomever he appoints, will manage to pour sand into the gears. But even if that happens, the bureau is not the only game in town.



The House and Senate investigations have significant limitations. They do not have adequate investigative resources and they have been periodically hamstrung by partisanship. But if the White House is seen to be engaged, as now appears, in a full-throated cover-up, will Republicans let Trump get away with it?

GOP elected officials have been remarkably craven up to this juncture, tolerating behavior in the White House that would have been inconceivable in any previous administration. Will they wake up now, or are they in too deep? Having revealed themselves, with some notable exceptions, to be devoid of principles, the one safe prediction we can make is that they will approach this question not with reference to right and wrong, and not by putting country ahead of party, but by studying the polls.



The larger question raised by the Comey firing is whether the United States is now officially turning into a banana republic. As more and more dots are connected, they are forming an ugly picture. The abrupt firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on March 11 is one such dot. Bharara had been told by Trump in November that he could stay in office. But of course his investigative bailiwick in the Southern District of New York encompassed a location that, as the months went by and as the Russia investigation proceeded, became increasingly sensitive: Trump Tower. Without explanation, Bharara was sacked.



A second is the bizarre White House interference in the House Intelligence Committee investigation, with Chairman Devin Nunes secretly invited to the White House to receive information which he then briefed to President Trump as if he obtained it from somewhere else. That escapade discredited the committee’s work and set it back for weeks. Then we have the efforts of the White House, over several months, to try to block former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying before Congress on the grounds that it would violate “client confidences.”

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

The stage-managed firing of Comey is the biggest blow of all to the rule of law thus far. Multiple news outlets are reporting that Trump decided to fire Comey sometime last week. He then asked his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to come up with a rationale for such a step. Never mind that this entailed putting the cart before the horse. And never mind that Sessions himself had formally recused himself from matters concerning the Russia investigation that Comey was heading up. This is the same Sessions who lied to the Senate about his own meetings with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and it is the same Sessions who recommended that the Trump campaign bring on board as a foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who is also under FBI investigation for his ties to Russian officials.



No one knows what will come next. But the degree of tumult, dishonesty and corruption is breathtaking. As the Trump administration, in the name of making America great again, drags the country ever deeper into crisis, one can make two safe predictions. First, many more utterly unpredictable things are bound to happen. And second, it will not end well either for Trump or for the country.

The wife of longtime ESPN broadcaster Chris Berman was one of two people killed in a car accident on Tuesday in Connecticut.

The Mercedes driven by Kathy Berman, 69, was struck from behind by a Ford Escape driven by an 89-year-old man in Woodbury at around 2:16 p.m., according to the Connecticut State Police summary of the accident obtained by USA TODAY Sports. The collision sent Berman’s car down an embankment before it overturned into a small body of water.

The Escape hit a utility pole after the initial collision and the driver, Edward Bertulis, died as result of his injuries.

""This is a devastating tragedy and difficult to comprehend,"" ESPN president John Skipper said in a statement. ""Chris is beloved by all his ESPN colleagues and for good reason: He has a huge heart and has given so much to so many over the years. We know how much his family means to him and all we can do at a moment like this is give him the love and support he will surely need at this hour. Our thoughts and prayers are with Chris, Meredith, Doug and the entire family.""",usa-today
16,Late night comes for President Trump over James Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Late-night comics on President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey. Take a look at our favorite jokes, then vote for your at opinion.usatoday.com.

Donald Trump gave FBI Director James Comey his walking papers just in time for the late-night comedians to work the news into their opening monologues.

""We'll have more on this tomorrow when they scramble to cover the whole thing up,"" promised Stephen Colbert.

Here are their best jokes on the story so far:

The Late Show With Stephen Colbert

""(The firing) showed no gratitude at all,"" Colbert said at the top of his monologue, just minutes after the story broke Tuesday evening. ""Did Trump forget about the Hillary emails that Comey talked about?""

Launching into his breathy Trump impression, the comedian imagined their parting, saying ""Thanks for the presidency, Jimmy. Now don't let the door hit you where the Electoral College split you.""

Jimmy Kimmel Live!

""A few hours ago (Trump) fired James Comey, the director of the FBI, which is kind of like O.J. firing Judge Ito halfway through the trial,"" the ABC host noted. ""He fired the director of the FBI while the director was investigating the possible collusion with Russia ... This is what dictators do. It's what reality TV stars do. They fire someone every week. Maybe that's what happened. He thinks he's still on The Celebrity Apprentice.""

Kimmel was amused by the reason White House gave for Comey's dismissal: ""It was because he mishandled the Hillary Clinton email situation, which is hilarious because that would mean Trump fired Comey for making him president.""

He also saw the firing as a business opportunity, announcing that he would be selling T-shirts bearing the slogan ""Comey is my homey.""

The Daily Show with Trevor Noah

While The Daily Show's old guard was reuniting on Colbert's show, Noah questioned the legality of Trump's decision. ""You can't just fire the FBI director. If he's gone, who's going to investigate Russia's ties to ... Ohhh.""

He then reminded his audience, ""I know how we said Trump was an African dictator. But right now, even Africans are watching this like, 'Yo, Donald Trump does not (mess) around.'""

He could barely keep a straight face while relating the reason for Comey's ouster. ""This is insane. Hey's basically saying he's doing this because of what Comey did to Hillary. That is the most gangster excuse I've ever heard. Trump is saying, 'I'm doing this to clear my good friend, 'Crooked Hillary' because James Comey just wanted to lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.'""

9,Aaron Hernandez's first days in prison trouble-filled as he vowed to 'run this place',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Judge Susan Garsh explains her decision to vacate the murder conviction against Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence for the murder of Odin Lloyd. USA TODAY Sports

Aaron Hernandez (Photo: Associated Press file photo)

Aaron Hernandez fought, served as a lookout, received a neck tattoo and stole an inmate’s calling card shortly after his arrival in the maximum security Massachusetts prison in April 2015.

The disciplinary records obtained by USA TODAY Sports from the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, the same facility where he was found hanged last month, show 25 alleged violations over an eight-day span in May 2015, shortly after he was convicted of murdering Odin Lloyd.

“You ain’t got (expletive) on me (expletive),” Hernandez told corrections officer after his first prison fight. “You just making up (expletive).

Hernandez was checked out by medical personnel and put in restrictive confinement when he continued his verbal barrage.

“This place ain’t (expletive) to me,” Hernandez said. “I’ll run this place and keep running (expletive). Prison aint (expletive) to me.”

Hernandez had a total of 78 disciplinary offenses spread across 12 incidents during his nearly two years at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, the majority of which took place during his first three months at the facility in Shirley, Mass.

""When people first enter custody, they need to make their bones,"" Larry Levine, the founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants who served 10 years in a federal prison, told USA TODAY Sports. ""They need to create a reputation that will carry them through their time in custody. Hernandez was probably being tested by the other inmate. By becoming a management and disciplinary problem, he showed that he was willing to stand up to staff and the inmate population, potentially anyone who got in his way.""

At the disciplinary hearings that followed, Hernandez either pled guilty or was found guilty by a hearing officer of 14 charges.

None of the incidents were forwarded to prosecutors.

Hernandez fought three times, according to the prison records. Levine, however, said the fact Hernandez served as a lookout early in his stint was just as noteworthy.

""No one in any prison respects a rat,"" Levine said. ""By acting as a lookout, he was tested to see if he could keep his mouth shut and be trusted. ""

One of the more serious altercations came in August 2015 after a new inmate attempted to shake Hernandez’s hand.

“Hernandez struck (name redacted) with a closed fist to the face and both men engage (sic) in a physical altercation,” a corrections officer wrote in the report of the incident. “The combatants ignored several direct orders to cease their actions and chemical agent was utilized to separate the inmates.”

Both Hernandez and the other inmate were put in segregation afterward.

Hernandez closed out 2015 with his ninth incident that year: possession of a weapon that was discovered in a search of his cell on Dec. 3. Corrections officers found a nearly six-inch piece of metal that had been sharpened into a knife. The weapon had a cloth handle and tether so it could be attached to the wrist.

He received 15 days in solitary confinement ---the maximum allowed under state guidelines --- and he lost access to the facility’s canteen, the prison equivalent to a general store, for 90 days.

Hernandez had only three other incidents during his stay at the prison, a stretch broken up by his trial on double-murder charges. After he was acquitted at that trial in April, he returned to the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center where he resumed serving his life sentence for the 2013 murder of Lloyd.

There were no documented infractions since October 2016 when Hernandez was found to have locked himself in the cell with another inmate, something not permitted under prison guidelines because it “disrupts the normal operation of the facility.”

The last time corrections officers responded to his cell was in the early hours of April 19 as he was found hanged with a bedsheet. His death at age 27 was ruled a suicide days later.",usa-today

9,How good is Kylian Mbappe? The teenager just spent 180 minutes torching the best defense in the world | FOX Sports,"What is Kylian Mbappe’s ceiling? Right now it’s looking to be somewhere between Thierry Henry and the Archangel Michael, but honestly there’s no telling just how good this kid can be.

We’re fresh off seeing an 18-year-old manchild terrorize one of the best defenses in European history. For 180 minutes, Mbappe put the fear of god into the Juventus back line, culminating in the goal that ended Juve’s historic scoreless streak. The Bianconeri had stood firm for 690 minutes, seeing off the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, and they’d even made it look easy.

Until they met Kylian Mbappe.

Monaco’s crown jewel was a problem for the Bianconeri from start to finish, with the wiry attacker showcasing every single tool in his extensive kit. It wasn’t just his eye-popping pace to get in behind, or his mesmerizing skill with the ball at his feet that gave the Juventus defense fits, but his understanding of the ebbs and flows of the game, and ability to consistently find pockets of space in dangerous areas made life hell for the Bianconeri. There was no hyperbole about it. He was a monster, and it went well beyond just physical skills.

Over two legs, Mbappe was the most constant and terrifying threat Juventus have seen this year.

Juventus’ defense were well aware of Mbappe’s danger before the match, and legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon gave him high praise before their first meeting, calling him an “incredible talent” and a “good kid.”

“Of course, the characteristics are similar [between he and Thierry Henry] – he plays for Monaco early in his career, the very slender and elegant running style,” Buffon told UEFA’s website.

“Probably, at this age, he is even better in front of goal than Henry was.”

Thierry Henry comparisons have become standard for Mbappe, and his ability to somehow exceed those expectations has become even more standard. Buffon was right to be wary, and the Frenchman gave the goalkeeper plenty of problems. He tested him a number of times in the first leg, bringing the very best out of the old man in the Old Lady’s goal, and was finally able to put one past the 39-year-old Italy legend with a nice finish in the 69th minute of the second match. It wasn’t enough to help Monaco progress past Juventus, but it was more than deserved for the effort he put in over two legs.

Mbappe’s goal was well earned, and it was the perfect showcase of just how diverse his talent is. Throughout the tie, and throughout this entire season, he’s shown his physical capabilities: There aren’t many athletes in the game who can keep up with him in a footrace. He’s showed off his silky smooth dribbling skills time and time again, twisting and turning defenders inside and out all through the season. He even managed to put Juventus’ best one-on-one defender Andrea Barzagli in a blender, joining an extremely exclusive list of Very Saucy Individuals.

But it wasn’t his athleticism or dribbling ability that got him on the scoresheet, it was his preternatural off-the-ball movement and timing inside the box. It was his understanding of where to be, and the determination to shrug off the attentions of Alex Sandro so he could ghost in and side-foot home Monaco’s only goal.

At basically a standstill, in tight quarters with the best defenders in the world looking for him, Mbappe still managed to get free. That has nothing to do with athleticism — it’s all instinct, intelligence and perfect timing. Whereas some youngsters can shine early on because of their physical gifts, Mbappe is well beyond that. And he has those physical gifts.

Barzagli himself was effusive in his praise for the young Frenchman after the first leg matchup, raving about the completeness of his game.

“We studied Mbappe, he is a devastating player,” said Barzagli. I’ve met some over the years, but at his age with that technique, physical strength pace, and above all his movements, because he changes things up and makes excellent movements off the ball. I’ve not seen someone like him.”

Ostensibly a central striker, Mbappe has drawn comparisons to Henry mainly because of that movement. Tall, with a string bean figure, Mbappe isn’t physically strong enough yet to regularly throw bodies around with burly center backs, but his sweeping runs through the center out to the wings cause devastation because of the way he’s able to pull central players wide, creating space for himself and his teammates. While Henry often favored drifting to the left wing in order to cut inside and have a shot on his stronger right foot, so far Mbappe’s shown he’s equally comfortable taking on players down the right wing as he is mirroring his predecessor down the left. A consummate team player, the teenager is just as likely to beat his defender to the end line and put in a tantalizing cross as he is to skate past his marker and force a shot on goal.

Even though he prefers drifting wide, part of Mbappe’s terrifying versatility is his efficacy through the middle, too. He’s more than capable of holding the ball up in the middle if necessary, joining in combination play with his strike partner Falcao, and working intricate one-twos with the creative midfielders behind him, or checking in deep only to spin and get in behind into the space he’s just created for himself. Despite his young age, he already seems to have the full bag of striker’s tricks, and it looks like he’s adding more to his repertoire with every match.

Wonderkids come along every single year, and the vast majority of them flame out rather than becoming legitimate stars. Every once in a while a player shows up who looks almost predestined for greatness though, and that aura is shining all over Mbappe.

It’s too early to call him a superstar yet, but there’s no doubting the fact that if he had a walk-up song, it’d be Lil Wayne’s “No Ceilings.”",fox-sports
9,Martin Truex Jr. will debut new No. 78 paint scheme at Kansas | FOX Sports,"Martin Truex Jr. heads to Kansas Speedway this weekend sitting second in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series driver points standings.

He’ll also arrive with a new paint scheme for his No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Toyota, courtesy of sponsor Auto-Owners Insurance. It will be the first of six races this season with Auto-Owners as his primary sponsor on the car, and Truex is hoping it will help change his luck at the 1.5-mile track where he has yet to win in 17 career starts.

That includes some races there recently where he’s suffered some bad luck — none worse than in last year’s spring event when he started from the pole and led a race-high 172 laps, but finished 14th. He also led 95 laps in the 2015 spring race at Kansas, only to finish ninth.

“No matter how many heartbreaks we’ve had at Kansas, I have all the confidence that our team will provide me with another fast race car and we will once again be competing for the win,” Truex said in a team release. “I am excited about having our car with the Auto-Owners Insurance colors for the first time this season. We had good runs last year with the blue Auto-Owners Toyota, including a victory at the Southern 500 (Darlington, S.C.).”

Truex already owns one win this season, going to Victory Lane at Kansas. He also has the most stage wins in the Cup Series with five, is second in stage points earned (124) and second in playoff bonus points earned (10).

In the first nine races of the season, he’s earned two top-five and six top-10 finishes while leading a total of 432 laps. Obviously, he’s looking to add to those impressive totals in the car featuring the paint scheme below.

9,NFL hires Dean Blandino's replacement as VP of officiating | FOX Sports,"The NFL announced Wednesday that Alberto Riveron will take over as the league’s senior vice president of officiating. The job was previously held by Dean Blandino (pictured), who stepped down last month to pursue other opportunities.

In addition to hiring Riveron, Russell Yurk was named vice president of instant replay. In that role, he will “direct the league’s instant replay operations in the Art McNally GameDay Central room and oversee all instant replay-related personnel.”

Riveron has 40 years of officiating experience, beginning in 1977 as an official in local youth leagues. He then transitioned to the collegiate level in 1990 before joining the NFL in 2003. In 2008, he became the NFL’s first Hispanic referee.

“Al has done a terrific job as a key member of our officiating staff for the past four seasons,” Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Prior to that, Al was an outstanding on-field official who earned the respect of his fellow officials, as well as coaches and players alike. To have Al leading our officiating department, and then to add talented, knowledgeable instant replay and officiating experts like Russell and Wayne, is a tremendous positive for us as we look forward to the 2017 season.”

Yurk has 10 years of experience as an official at the high school and collegiate level and has spent the last seven years in the NFL’s replay department. The team of Riveron, Yurk and Wayne Mackie will have the final say on all replay decisions, along with the consultation of referees.

The NFL is moving to a more centralized replay procedure this season, which should hopefully speed up the process.",fox-sports

9,Juventus will have to win the Champions League to finally get the credit they deserve | FOX Sports,"Juventus are en route to a sixth straight Serie A title. And while they are also into second Champions League final in three years, they still can’t get people to call them one of Europe’s best teams.

The rarified air of European elites is still reserved for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Even Chelsea and the Manchester clubs will get more love than Juventus.

After all, critics will say, “Serie A is weak.” And even as Juventus were rolling to a dominant first leg win in the Champions League semifinals, “they were lucky to draw Monaco.”

Those statements are both true. Serie A is weak and they were lucky to draw Monaco in the semifinals (the alternatives were Real Madrid and Atletico Madric), but that doesn’t make Juventus any less brilliant. They’re not knocks on The Old Lady, simply statements of facts like this one — Juventus are nothing short of brilliant and maybe even the best team in the entire world.

Consider: The Old Lady are nearly into their second Champions League final since Bayern last played in one, just toppled Barcelona, 3-0, in dominating fashion to make the semifinals, and dispatched Real Madrid in the semifinals two years ago to make that final.

If there is a holy trinity of clubs right now — Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich — then where do you put the team that has gotten the better of all three just since 2015?

Most incredibly, Juventus haven’t done it with one special group of players. After all, we’ve seen everything come together for a club, vaulting them into the upper echelon until they’re sold off and the team goes back to mediocrity. They were the team of Paul Pogba, Arturo Vidal and Andrea Pirlo, but they’re all gone and now they’re the team of Paulo Dybala and Miralem Pjanic, with the ability to spend absurd money on Gonzalo Higuain to fill their lone hole up top in front of a defense that went 690 minutes without conceding a single goal.

While you can point at Barcelona’s slow midfield, Real Madrid’s leaky defense and Bayern Munich’s lack of a secondary scoring option to Robert Lewandowski, Juventus are just about flawless. To find a weakness requires calling Mario Mandzukic a striker pushed out wide, even though he’s been terrific there, or saying Pjanic can’t handle the defensive duties asked of him, even though he’s proven (albeit surprisingly) that he absolutely can. Sure Higuain might look a little hefty, but the scale only reads two goals in the first leg of their semifinal tie.

From top to bottom, Juventus are run expertly, featuring world-class players, future stars and established stalwarts, all in a gleaming stadium that is home to one of Europe’s best atmospheres. It will be on display next week when The Old Lady try to book their spot in yet another final. And if they do, the excuses will be trotted out again. They’re good, but not on the level of Europe’s elites, because it’s just Monaco and they have it easy in Serie A.

Even as more people recognize how special Juve are, they’re still shortchanged. Narratives are stubborn that way and there’s nothing fans hate more than opening the doors to an exclusive club. But sports are still a place where trophies are everything and Juventus are 90 minutes from the biggest and most prestigious trophy in club soccer. Win that and the trinity of Europe’s elite will finally and belatedly grow to four, lazy excuses about Serie A or opposition be damned.",fox-sports

6,McConnell: 'Too much is at stake' for new probe,"Story highlights President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday night

The Senate Majority Leader responded to Democrats on Wednesday from the Senate floor

(CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected Wednesday any calls for a new investigation by a special prosecutor into alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign in the wake of the President's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.

McConnell said ""too much is at stake"" to halt an investigation already in progress, though some in his own party appear to leave the door open to such a process.

The Kentucky Republican said from the Senate floor such an investigation into Russian meddling into the US election last year would ""only serve to impede the current work being done to not only discover what the Russians may have done but also to let this body and the national security community develop counter measures.""

McConnell was referencing the Senate intelligence committee investigation led by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

6,"Trump meets Lavrov, Kislyak at White House","Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak at the White House Wednesday amid the swirling investigation of Russian contacts with Trump campaign and transition officials in 2016 and Tuesday's firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was handling the probe.

Kislyak has been a central figure in the controversy, as then-national security adviser Michael Flynn was fired after it emerged that he had misrepresented conversations with Kislyak to others in the White House. Flynn is now one of the key figures in the investigation.

The Russian Embassy tweeted a photo of Trump shaking the hand of Russia's ambassador in what appears to be the Oval Office. Current and former US intelligence officials have accused Kislyak of being a top spy and recruiter of spies, a notion that Russian officials have dismissed.

The Russian Embassy tweeted the photo as Trump was set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday. The meeting will be the highest-level encounter between the US administration and Moscow since Trump's inauguration.

Lavrov met first Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss Ukraine, Syria and other bilateral issues, but even their brief appearance before reporters was upstaged by the Comey firing.

After Tillerson briefly welcomed Lavrov and thanked the Russian minister for coming to Washington, a reporter asked if their talks were shadowed by the former FBI director's sudden dismissal.

A visibly irritated Lavrov said, ""Was he fired? You're kidding! You're kidding.""

Lavrov, who has been Russia's top diplomat for more than a decade, was already due to be in town for the meeting with Tillerson before the Trump meeting was announced.

The Lavrov-Tillerson conversation was expected to be ""broad, blunt and businesslike,"" a senior official told CNN ahead of the meeting. With ongoing fighting paralyzing eastern Ukraine, the two foreign ministers were set to discuss the need to fully implement the Minsk ceasefire agreement.

Tillerson was also set to press Lavrov on the need to de-escalate the violence in Syria's civil war, make sure humanitarian assistance was reaching people there and find a political solution to the conflict. The State Department official said it was ""too early to tell"" whether a Russian-backed plan for safe zones inside Syria was viable.

The Trump administration said Comey was fired for mishandling the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of atate, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings.

Alleged ties to Russia

Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she alerted the White House earlier this year that then-Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be ""essentially blackmailed by the Russians.""

Her testimony pushed the story of the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia back into the headlines.

In an interview last week, Trump once again refused to blame Russia for attempting to influence the 2016 election through hacking and other means, despite an overwhelming consensus by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin also spoke by phone last week about the war in Syria for the first time since Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian government air base last month after an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime.

The US missile strike angered Moscow and led Lavrov to declare that ""it's sad how damaging this is to the already bad relations between US and Russia.""

Seasoned diplomat

Since Lavrov's meeting with Trump is closed to the press, few details may emerge of what they discuss. However, its timing -- in the midst of the furor over the Trump administration's firing of Comey -- has raised some eyebrows.

JUST WATCHED Lavrov on U.S. election hacking accusations, Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lavrov on U.S. election hacking accusations, Trump 10:10

Lavrov is a highly experienced diplomat who has served as Russian foreign minister since 2004. Before that, he was Russia's ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1994 to 2004.

In total, Lavrov, who speaks fluent English, French and Sinhalese according to his foreign ministry biography, has 45 years of diplomatic experience, while his US counterpart Tillerson has just over three months.

The pair's face-to-face meeting Wednesday will focus on ending the fighting in eastern Ukraine and Syria, the US State Department said. It comes ahead of an Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska.

""On Syria, the secretary intends to discuss efforts to de-escalate violence, provide humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and set the stage for a political settlement of the conflict,"" the State Department said in a statement.

Russia, a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has taken a central role in ongoing Syria peace talks , while the United States -- which continues to target ISIS in Syria and Iraq as part of an international coalition -- has not been directly involved.

'Reset' of relations?

After meeting with Putin and Lavrov last month in Moscow, Tillerson was blunt about their differences, saying US-Russia relations were ""at a low point, there is a low level of trust between our two countries.""

JUST WATCHED GPS Web Extra: Rice talks relations with Russia Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH GPS Web Extra: Rice talks relations with Russia 01:40

But Tillerson also offered his Russian counterparts a bridge, tempering the open tensions by urging that Washington and Moscow find ways to cooperate.

Before taking office, Trump touted his intention to improve ties with Moscow. This ambition has been largely derailed, however, by continued questions over his campaign's alleged ties to Russia, accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and the two countries' disagreements over Syria.

In 2009, under then-President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton famously presented Lavrov with a ""reset"" button to symbolically restart US-Russia relations. Unfortunately, instead of ""reset"" the Russian word on the button read ""overcharged.""

Diplomatically, Lavrov said he would keep the button on his desk. The attempt at a reset didn't work and relations between the US and Russia at the end of the Obama administration plunged to Cold War-era lows.",cnn
6,General election 2017: Labour pledge £20bn for English schools,"Image copyright PA Image caption Labour are promising to transform access to lifelong learning

Labour has pledged to invest more than £20bn in schools in England by 2022 by significantly raising business taxes.

It said it would protect real-terms schools funding and cut class sizes for five, six and seven-year olds by hiking corporation tax from 19% to 26%.

The Lib Dems will spend £7bn over the same period to protect cash per pupil, funded by a smaller rise in the tax.

Theresa May said spending was at record levels and 1.8 million more children were in a good or outstanding school.

The prime minister also defended proposed changes to the national funding formula for schools in England, which have caused concerns among some Tory candidates, saying everyone agreed that the existing mechanism was ""unfair"" and needed reform.

BBC education editor Branwen Jeffreys says schools in England have been experiencing a financial squeeze for the first time in 20 years.

Head teachers have been warning about job losses caused by cash shortages, with the National Audit Office estimating schools will have to cut £3bn from budgets by 2019-20 to meet rising cost pressures.

Launching their plans for a ""national education service"", Labour said they were committed to protecting core schools budgets through a £4.8bn annual real-terms funding increase.

They would also ensure no schools ended up with less cash as a result of the planned national funding shake-up by making available £335m of extra money a year for those affected.

Their other proposals include:

£1.9bn for skills and free ""lifelong education""

£582m to restore the Educational Maintenance Allowance

Free school meals for primary schools

£1.8bn on bringing back student maintenance grants

Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast the Conservatives had ""broken their contract"" with the public over funding and grammar school expansion, to the point that some schools were having to let teachers and teaching assistants go.

""I want to reassure parents up and down the country that my priority is that our education system will be fully funded,"" she said.

""Not only will schools have the money they need to ensure every child reaches their full potential but adult education will be free at the point of use so people can go back into education.""

She said this ""transformative"" change would mean anyone who wanted to re-train, for example, as a nurse would be able to do so.

Asked about Labour's policy on student tuition fees - after footage emerged of shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying last month that Labour would scrap them - she told BBC Radio 4's Today ""watch this space"".

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that Labour's combined pledges so far amount to £8.4bn in extra spending a year by 2022, compared with that envisaged by the Conservatives.

The think tank has calculated that raising corporation tax to 26% - which would return the headline rate to its 2011 level - could raise at least £19bn a year in the short term but that the yields could reduce over time as the move could affect business investment.

The Lib Dems claimed their own plans went further than Labour's and were more financially credible.

Leader Tim Farron said his party would raise corporation tax to 20% and abolish the married couples tax allowance, which has been in force since 2015. The rest of the funding would come from the £100bn in revenue he said the UK would hold onto by opting to stay in the EU's internal market.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim Farron said schools were having to lay off teachers

Pressed on how he could guarantee this given the Tories want to leave the single market and the Lib Dems have ruled out a post-election coalition with Labour, he told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""setting out your priorities is incredibly important"".

""It is desperately needed... We are going to see over the next three years £3bn taken out of schools. Two thirds of schools in Britain will be sacking at least one teacher before the start of the academic year and that is because the Conservatives have chosen priorities which are wrong.""

The Conservatives said Labour had already set aside the proceeds of the corporation tax rise to other projects and were also going back on a commitment not to increase the rate for small business - now mooted to go up to 21% by 2020-21.

Speaking in Nottinghamshire, Mrs May said the Conservatives were making their own funding guarantees - such as protecting the £2.5bn pupil premium for disadvantaged families - but that it wasn't simply a question of extra resources.

""It is about the results you see and the education you are providing for the children,"" she said. ""We want to ensure every child gets a good start in life and that is why what we are proposing is a good school place for every single child.""

The Green Party of England and Wales warned against ""pumping more money into a broken system"".

""We would bring free schools and academies back under the control of local authorities so they can be held to account and get rid of the relentless and counter-productive testing of teachers and pupils,"" its spokeswoman Vix Lowthion said.

As education is a devolved matter, the pledges relate to England only, and the amount Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receives would be determined by the funding formula.",bbc-news
3,Dan Heyman: US reporter arrested for shouting questions on healthcare,"Image copyright Jake Zuckerman/ Charleston Gazette-Mail Image caption Heyman says he was not hurt during his arrest

A reporter was arrested on Tuesday night at the West Virginia Capitol for allegedly causing a disturbance by shouting questions to two Trump aides.

Dan Heyman had asked Health Secretary Tom Price and White House adviser Kellyanne Conway about coverage under the Republican healthcare plan.

The veteran health reporter wanted to know if domestic violence would be covered as a pre-existing condition.

He later said he ""was trying doing my job"". He faces a fine and jail time.

Mr Heyman, who works for the Public News Service, spoke to reporters after being released by police.

He said that he had been following the Trump team's entourage through the capitol building while wearing his press badge and a shirt identifying his media outlet.

""He didn't say anything,"" Mr Heyman told reporters about Mr Price's refusal to answer his question.

""So I persisted,"" he added.

Mr Price and Ms Conway were in West Virginia for a conference on the opioid epidemic, and its effect on West Virginia, which has seen more overdoses than any other US state.

""This is my job, this is what I'm supposed to do,"" he said. ""I think it's a question that deserves to be answered. I think it's my job to ask questions and I think it's my job to try to get answers.""

According to a criminal complaint, Mr Heyman was ""aggressively breaching the secret service agents to the point where the agents were forced to remove him a couple of times from the area walking up the hallway in the main building of the Capitol.

""The defendant was causing a disturbance at Ms Conway and Secretary Price.""

He was charged with wilful disruption of government processes.

Mr Heyman retorted that he was in a public space, and had not been warned to step away.

The American Civil Liberties Union has defended Mr Heyman's actions, saying his ""arrest is a blatant attempt to chill an independent, free press. The charges against him are outrageous, and they must be dropped immediately"".

""They [the Trump administration] have shown us every day since Donald Trump took office that they don't care about the First Amendment, or the free press. Today was just another example of that. It's horrifying,"" said ACLU-West Virginia legal director Jamie Lynn Crofts.",bbc-news
3,"Non-EU parents may have EU residence right, ECJ rules","Image copyright AFP Image caption Depriving non-EU citizens of residence rights could indirectly deny EU citizens - their children - of their own rights, the court found

Non-EU citizens may have the right to residence in the EU if their children are EU citizens, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled.

It made the judgement in the case of a woman from Venezuela who had a child with a Dutch citizen from whom she has since legally separated.

She was denied social welfare and child benefit payments by Dutch authorities.

The rights of non-EU citizens in the EU have come to the fore as Britain prepares to negotiate to leave.

The European Union says questions about the status of Britons in the remaining 27 EU countries, and of those countries' nationals in the UK, must be resolved as a priority in negotiations.

The ECJ's ""interference"" in national court judgments about migration was cited by some who advocated for the UK to leave the EU.

Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU

EU demands 'serious UK response' on citizens' rights

Wednesday's ruling concerned a Venezuelan national who came to the Netherlands on a tourist visa.

In 2009, she had a child with a Dutch national with whom she lived in Germany until their separation in 2011, when she and the child left the family home and she became responsible for care of her daughter without support from the father.

But because she did not have a right to residence, Dutch authorities rejected the mother's application for welfare payments.

But the ECJ has now ruled that EU law does not allow a member state to take decisions which block the legal rights of a family member of an EU citizen - in this case, the woman's child, who is a Dutch citizen via her father.

The court argued that any threat to the mother's right to remain in the EU would deprive the child of the ""genuine enjoyment"" of her own rights under European law.

The ruling applies to cases where the child has a relationship of dependency on a parent which means the child would have to leave the territory of the EU if the parent did. That would require assessment of a number of factors including age, the child's development and its emotional ties to each parent.

It is now left to the Dutch courts to make a final decision on the individual case involving the family in the light of the decision handed down by the European judges.

On Thursday afternoon, the European Parliament will hold a hearing into the rights of EU citizens in the UK.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft fully dives into artificial intelligence,"Between Cortana and chatbots, it’s clear Microsoft wants to create smarter interactions between people and their technology. However, the company has never proclaimed its plans to get into full blown artificial intelligence – that is until now.

At its annual Microsoft Build developer conference, the Redmond-based company announced its plans to infuse AI into every product and service it offers including Xbox, Windows, Bing and Office to name a few. The software maker demonstrated how AI can help users present a PowerPoint with real-time translations with its translation API.

In another demonstration, Microsoft combined its AI with a cognitive vision service so players could manipulate a slingshot with a real-sense camera tracking the position of their hands. That might sound an awful lot like Kinect, but the idea here is to build an interactive experience on top of hardware already built into computers.

That’s not the only cognitive service offers, Microsoft announced it has tallied up a total of 29. A few of its latest AI services include Bing Custom Search, Custom Vision Service, Custom Decision Service and a Video Indexer.

As the name might suggest Microsoft Cognitive Services allow programs to look for and analyze data whether it be visual, audio or written.

With this level of machine learning developers can build apps that recognize gestures, translate text in multiple languages, deconstruct video for quicker search, editing and real-time captioning, and even customize data to recognize images to categorize them.

A multi-faceted backbone

Of course the benefits of Microsoft AI is only half the picture. To create this intelligent network, Microsoft is leveraging the power of its cloud computing Azure platform. At the same time Microsoft Graph collates business and user data – with their consent – to drive AI development.

For the time being, AI development is only be accessible to developers with access to a private preview of Azure Batch AI Training. Likewise, it will probably be sometime before we see Microsoft AI integration beyond business and enterprise applications. However, we can’t wait to see how AI will affect consumer experiences like Windows 10 and Xbox.",techradar

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made a joke Wednesday about the firing of FBI Director James Comey during a brief appearance before reporters at the State Department.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson welcomed Lavrov in the Treaty Room, saying he looks forward to continuing a dialogue the two began in Moscow “on a very broad range of topics.”

When a reporter asked if President Trump’s firing of the FBI director Tuesday “cast a shadow on your talks,” Lavrov responded with a joke.

“Was he fired?” Lavrov asked. The reporter answered “yes.” Lavrov continued: “You are kidding. You are kidding.”

He then waived his hand with a nod of his head, and walked away with a smiling Tillerson.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a video of the exchange on Twitter.

Bormida in Liguria, Italy. (Photo: Daniele Galliano/Facebook)

Has the razza del ratto (rat race) got you down? Is life too febbrile (hectic) where you live?



But are you worried you don’t have enough contanti (cash) to live a more peaceful life?

Then you might be interested in the Italian hillside village of Bormida, which is about to offer a payment of €2,000 ($2,175) and rents as low as $50 a month to reverse its declining population.

Bormida, located in the mountainous Liguria region – Genoa, about 50 miles away, is the nearest big city – had declined to 390 residents in 2014, when the current mayor, Daniele Galliano, took office, according to the local Il Secolo XIX newspaper.

Spurred by visions of a ghost town, Galliano began measures to reverse the decay.

Now the population is 394, which may not seem much of a success until you consider that 54 people have either died or moved away against just four births.

""Instead of seeing a heavy demographic deficit, the situation is stable thanks to the initiatives of the municipal administration to encourage those who, by necessity or pleasure, wish to live in a small mountain community like ours,"" Galliano told Il Vostro Giornale, another local publication.

But with only four people added, he decided more-enticing measures were needed, hence the subsidies, which also include a $130-a-month rent for larger homes.

""We couldn't rent them at market value, so we chose a symbolic number and the requests abounded: the important thing was to repopulate the village,"" Galliano told Il Secolo XIX.

According to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, details of the offer still needed to be settled and approved by the local council, Galliano wrote on his Facebook page. But if the proposal is passed, anyone who moves to Bormida will be given €2,000.

You probably won’t be able to spend the money all at once – the “Bor(ing)” in Bormida, which has a population of more than 1,000 in the 1950s, gives a clue as to the pace of its life.

According to Cosmopolitan magazine, the village has one main street, four restaurants (hey, this is Italy), a bed and breakfast and a post office that opens only three days a week. Much of the architecture dates back to 1200s.

“There is nothing much to do here,” Oddone Giuseppe, manager of one of the restaurants, told the Guardian. “But life is so simple and natural, we have forests, goats, the church, and plenty of good food. Life would definitely be free of stress.”

Some people, though, worry that €2,000 won’t go far enough.

“Mr. Mayor, I’m available to move and give up the €2,000,” wrote a Facebook user, Amedeo Alloca, on the mayor’s posting, “but I can’t live off air. I have a family with two small children. If you can guarantee a job, even the most humble one, it wouldn’t be a problem.”

Maybe there’s a job in one of those restaurants.

Sen. Dick Durbin said he'd await word on if the investigation will continue from the White House. (May 9) AP

WASHINGTON — As calls for an independent prosecutor intensify on both sides of the aisle, President Trump and aides argued Wednesday that the firing of FBI Director James Comey had nothing to do with the agency's ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

""He wasn't doing a good job,"" Trump told reporters about his reasons for firing Comey. ""Very simply, he was not doing a good job.""

Trump's first in-person remarks about Tuesday's abrupt dismissal came after an Oval Office sit-down with Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov – which only sharpened the debate over the tie between Comey's firing and Russia investigation.

The Comey news did not affect the meeting with Lavrov, Trump said as he sat next to former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Comey's firing came just days after he requested more funds for the Russia investigation.

That's sure to fire up Democrats, who are already saying Trump is trying to short-circuit the Russia investigation, and have united in their calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor.

As many Democrats described the Comey dismissal as ""Nixonian,"" in reference to President Richard Nixon's firing of the Watergate special prosecutor in 1973, there could be some Republican support for an independent investigation. ""It is now harder to resist calls for an independent investigation,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., on MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""It's pretty tough to fire the guy who's investigating your campaign.""

However, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, speaking on MSNBC's Morning Joe and other television news programs, said the FBI director's overall record subjected him to dismissal. Sanders cited the recommendations of Justice Department leaders who said Comey had lost his effectiveness as the bureau's leader — in part because of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Comey announced just 11 days before the November presidential election that he was reopening the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State. As Sanders noted in her interview defending the firing, many Democrats blamed for her loss to Trump in the November election.

Stressing the Trump administration has no plans to get involved in FBI business, Sanders said the Russia investigations will ""continue whether Jim Comey is there or not.""

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted: ""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!""

The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

Disputing Trump's reasoning on the timing, Democrats insisted that Trump could have fired Comey over his handling of the Clinton investigation anytime during the past four months he's been in office. Instead, they said, the president waited until the various Russia investigations heated up. ""He feels the noose tightening,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, also speaking on Morning Joe.

​Kaine noted that, in Trump's termination letter to Comey, the president thanked the FBI director for ""you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.""

As Kaine put it: ""That shows a deeply insecure president.""

Other Republicans joined in the criticism of the timing of Trump's stunning move.

Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., heading up one of the investigations as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he is ""troubled by the timing and reasoning"" of Comey's firing. He added that it ""further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.""

Trump, of course, doesn't see it that way. During his morning tweet storm, Trump said that ""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!""

Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

The president said he will hire someone ""who will do a far better job"" in restoring the FBI's prestige.

The new director will inherit an ongoing investigation into whether there was any collusion between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian who sought to influence last year's election by hacking Democrats close to Clinton and releasing the stolen information to websites such as WikiLeaks.

The investigation focuses on whether there are any Russian links to Trump associates Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager; Carter Page, a member of a Trump foreign policy advisory board; and Roger Stone, a long-time friend and political adviser to Trump.

Manafort, Page, and Stone have all denied collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.

Trump's decision to fire Comey comes amid a flood of news about the Russia investigation. On Monday, Sally Yates, the acting attorney general Trump fired earlier in his term, told a Senate panel that she warned the White House that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied about contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and was therefore vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Trump later fired Flynn.

White House officials downplayed the timing of all these developments, however, insisting that the same Democrats condemning the decision have in the past called for Comey's removal over his handling of last year's Clinton email investigation.

In the report that Trump used to justify his decision, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a July 5 news conference to announce that charges would not be filed against Clinton, even as he criticized her over the handling of classified information. “We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" Rosenstein said. His letter recommending firing also specifically mentioned Comey's decision to announce new investigation in the Clinton investigation on October 28.

Trump, meanwhile, had praised Comey for re-opening the investigation in October – and has in the months since complimented the FBI director. Introducing Comey during a White House event in January, Trump said that ""he's become more famous than me.""

6,Senate blocks move to overturn Obama-era rule on drilling,"In this June 12, 2014, file photo, oil pumps and natural gas burn off in Watford City, N.D. (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a surprising win for environmentalists and Democrats and a blow to the fossil-fuel industry, the Senate on Wednesday failed in a bid to reverse an Obama-era regulation restricting harmful methane emissions that escape from oil and gas wells on federal land.

The vote was 51-49 in the Republican-led Senate with three GOP lawmakers — Maine’s Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona — joining forces with the Democrats to block efforts to overturn the rule.

President Obama finalized a rule in November that would force energy companies to capture methane that’s burned off or “flared” at drilling sites because it earns less money than oil.

Energy companies frequently “flare” or burn off vast supplies of methane — the primary component of natural gas — at drilling sites because it earns less money than oil. An estimated $330 million a year in natural gas is wasted through leaks or intentional releases — enough to power about 5 million homes a year.

Gas flaring is so prevalent in oil-rich North Dakota that night-time flaring activity on drilling sites is visible in NASA photos from space.

For months, Republicans have rammed through reversals of rules issued by Obama on gun rights, coal production, hunting and money for family planning clinics. They have used the previously obscure Congressional Review Act, which requires just a simple majority in both chambers to overturn rules imposed recently imposed by the executive branch.

The latest target was the Interior Department rule on methane.

A coalition of groups with ties to the fossil-fuel industry and the conservative Koch Brothers had waged a public campaign to overturn the rule, which they said would decrease energy production on federal lands, raise energy costs and eliminate jobs.

Republicans and industry groups call the rule an example of federal overreach under Obama and say it duplicates state rules in place throughout the West.

Democrats and environmental groups countered that the rule protects the public health and generates millions of dollars in revenue for state, local and tribal governments.

Gleeful Democrats hailed the vote as a breakthrough in the GOP-controlled Congress.

“Today’s vote is a win for American taxpayers, a win for public health and a win for our climate,” said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. “Rejecting this Republican attempt to allow oil and gas companies to continue wasting natural gas owned by the American people will ensure that American taxpayers will not get burned. And it will ensure we don’t lose control of managing methane emissions on public lands that contribute to climate change.”

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s top lobbying group, called the Senate vote disappointing, but said in a statement it looks forward to working with the Trump administration on policies to boost energy production.

Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society, an environmental group that had pushed to defend the Obama rule, said the Senate vote was the result of grass-roots efforts by voters across the country.

“In recent months, thousands of Americans asked the Senate to stand up for clean air and against the oil lobby, and their efforts were successful today,” Williams said.

But it’s just like why Russell Westbrook took Kevin Durant’s phone call - because Russell was playing from a position of strength. Well, Peyton was too. He’s going to take Jim’s phone call and say ‘OK, I’m good, because I actually got my team to two Super Bowls.’ They got crushed the first time, but they got there. ‘And Jim, since I’ve been gone, he hasn’t done much of anything.’

9,Mike D'Antoni's NBA revolution has come back to haunt him and the Rockets | FOX Sports,"When Mike D'Antoni surveys the current state of the NBA, he must feel like a proud papa — but one whose progeny are trying to destroy him.

More than a decade ago, the sultan of seven seconds or less sought to revolutionize professional basketball. He joined forces with a slight Canadian suffering from a back injury to execute his vision of free-flowing, positionless basketball, where teams played their best five players at any given moment, regardless of the strictures of tradition.

Such disdain for dogma wasn't exactly new a decade ago; teams had dabbled with small ball here and there for as long as there had been an NBA. Combined with the league's growing affinity for the 3-pointer, though, D'Antoni was on the cusp of a revolution.

As is so often the case when conventional wisdom is overturned, D'Antoni's ideas spread like wildfire.

By 2011, the Dallas Mavericks were using aspects of the Seven Seconds or Less Suns to knock off LeBron James and the Miami Heat, who in turn incorporated small-ball to win two titles, only to be bested by the Spurs, who took D'Antoni's offense to new levels and knocked off The King.",fox-sports

9,Giants owner says it’s ‘premature’ to think Davis Webb will be Eli Manning’s successor | FOX Sports,"Immediately after the New York Giants drafted Davis Webb in the third round, there was talk of him being Eli Manning’s heir apparent. He has good potential, is a year or two away from being a starter, and Manning’s declining play has created some cause for concern in New York.

It seems like the perfect situation for the Giants and Webb, but co-owner John Mara wants everyone to take a step back before handing the rookie anything.

“I think it’s a little premature to be anointing this guy as the heir apparent to Eli,” Mara said on The Rich Eisen Show. “He hasn’t set foot on the field yet. But he’s got a lot of talent and we’re looking forward to seeing what we got when he gets here. As Bill Parcells used to say, let’s not get his bust ready for Canton just yet.”

Webb has yet to take any snaps with the Giants, but he’ll do so at rookie minicamp later this week. As for the regular season, Webb isn’t even guaranteed a spot on the game day roster each week.

He’ll have to beat out Josh Johnson and Geno Smith for the backup job, which is easier said than done. Smith is a proven No. 2 quarterback in the NFL and understands a pro-style offense better than Davis does. In the event that Manning gets hurt, the Giants would probably rather go to a player with multiple years of experience than a raw rookie.

That being said, Webb does have the brighter future. He just won’t be handed anything – especially the starting gig after Manning moves on.

“He’s a talented guy, but let’s let him get on the field and let’s let him play in the preseason and develop,” Mara said. “If he’s the successor, that’s great. If not, then we’ll find somebody else.”

Webb is the Giants’ highest-drafted quarterback since they took Philip Rivers in 2004, so there are certainly high expectations for the rookie in the coming years. He just has a long way to go before he makes an impact in New York.",fox-sports

9,Dustin Poirer: Eddie Alvarez 'made a mistake' signing to fight me at UFC 211 | FOX Sports,"Dustin Poirier wants to make one thing very clear ahead of his fight at UFC 211.

He has the utmost respect for former lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez and all the accolades he’s racked up over the years as one of the best fighters on the planet for more than a decade.

That being said, Poirier heard the rumors that Alvarez picked him as an opponent for the card taking place on Saturday night and he believes the Philadelphia native will regret that decision once they step into the Octagon together.

“He just made a mistake,” Poirier told FOX Sports about the fight with Alvarez. “He signed the papers and now it’s too late.”

Outside of the fact that he has to fight Alvarez at UFC 211, Poirier has nothing but good things to say about his opponent, especially when considering the laundry list of legends he’s faced during his career.

Alvarez has battled it out against the best lightweights in the world across several continents while consistently sitting near the top of the rankings if not holding onto a championship belt.

There’s no denying that Alvarez has put together a hall of fame worthy resume and Poirier will be the first person to agree with that statement but none of that matters when it comes to their fight.

Poirier knows that a lifetime on top also means a mountain of battle scars suffered over the years and he plans on opening up some of those old wounds on Saturday night.

“I respect him and I appreciate what he’s done in the sport and the miles he’s had to travel to do it. That being said, I’m a warrior and I’m going to go out there and damage this guy,” Poirier said.

“He wears damage bad and I’m going to damage him. That’s what this fight is to me. Go in there, be slick, be crafty, I’m evolving in the sport, I’m getting better every week. I feel like I’m hitting a stride. I’ve stumbled in the past but I’m one of the best fighters in the world and I absolutely know it in my heart.”

Alvarez hasn’t suffered defeat very often during his career and throughout his 33 professional fights, he’s only been finished by strikes on two different occasions.

Poirier won’t exactly be gunning for the knockout but he knows that if he lands his best punches, Alvarez won’t be standing by the time the final bell sounds.

“It won’t happen. It’s simple and plain. His body can’t take the damage,” Poirier said. “I’m bigger and stronger and my technique’s the best it’s ever been. If he goes out there and makes the wrong moves and allows me to connect, I’ll put him away. I’ll finish Eddie Alvarez.

“I respect that about Eddie. He comes in there looking for blood. He doesn’t break, he has a strong heart and a strong will and I’m excited about that kind of fighter. So let’s go, let’s fight.”

16,Sources: Comey sought resources for Russia probe,"Story highlights James Comey spoke to the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee last week

The Justice Department denied the allegation the former FBI director had requested more help

(CNN) FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department for more resources for the agency's investigation into Russian meddling of the US election and ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, just the week before the President fired him.

Comey told the heads of the Senate intelligence committee that he went to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week and pushed for more resources to be devoted to the Russia investigation, according to two sources familiar with the discussion.

Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Flores denies Comey asked Rosenstein for more resources. She called reporting to the contrary ""100% false,"" and told reporters she spoke directly with Rosenstein about the reports.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia met Monday with Comey and urged him to speed up the Russia investigation. Comey acknowledged in this discussion that things were moving slowly.

3,Trump says Comey 'wasn't doing a good job',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

US President Donald Trump has said he fired FBI director James Comey because ""he was not doing a good job"".

He gave his first in-person explanation of the FBI chief's dismissal during a surprise meeting with Henry Kissinger.

The president has said he fired Mr Comey over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails.

But Mr Comey reportedly asked for more money for his inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the US election, according to US media.

Days before his removal, he made the request to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who recommended Mr Comey's dismissal to the president, according to leaks.

Mr Comey's dismissal has shocked Washington and outraged Democrats.

The sacking ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,"" said Adam Schiff, who is the highest ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

But the president stood by his actions on Wednesday morning, hours before a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - his first with any Russian official since taking power.

""James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI,"" he said in early morning tweets.

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" he added.

It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.

What is the latest reaction on Wednesday?

Russian President Vladimir Putin weighed in from a hockey rink in Sochi, saying: ""We have nothing to do with that"".

""President Trump is acting in according with his competence and in accordance with his law and constitution,"" he told CBS.

Meanwhile, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will request a closed and ""if necessary, classified"" all-senators separate briefing from senior Justice Department officials.

He also called for a special prosecutor to oversee the FBI investigation into any potential Russian ties to Mr Trump's associates.

But Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Mr Trump demonstrated ""strong and decisive leadership"" in his decision and the move was ""based solely and exclusively on his commitment to the best interest of the American people"".

""The president made the right decision at the right time,"" he said.

Why was James Comey fired?

President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"".

Mr Sessions said the department of justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"".

Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Mrs Clinton's emails, given that Mr Trump often praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption James Comey left LA for Washington DC escorted by motorcade

But on Tuesday, Mr Trump followed the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote a letter saying he could not defend the director's handling of the investigation into Secretary Clinton.

He added Mr Comey had been wrong to ""usurp"" the previous attorney general in July 2016 when he announced the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump's letter dismissing Mr Comey was released by the White House

Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.

The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.

What about the Russia investigation?

Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations but no conclusions have yet been reached.

""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Mr Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.

""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer: ""Mr President, with all due respect, you're making a big mistake""

Mr Trump responded on Twitter that Mr Schumer had recently expressed his lack of confidence in the FBI chief.

A cover-up? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Donald Trump and senior justice department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.

Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree.

How did Comey handle the email inquiry?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comey explains why he went public reopening Clinton email probe

Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.

The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.

He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

What was Clinton FBI probe about?

He told the Senate last week it had made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Mrs Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Mr Comey.

He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her husband.

But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.

Watergate 2.0?

Image copyright AP Image caption Nixon became the only US president to resign from the job

In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington. The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters.

The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Mr Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up.

""Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him,"" the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday.

Mr Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. He later became the only US president to resign.",bbc-news
3,Comey fired: Why might Trump have axed FBI chief?,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Donald Trump is getting used to wielding the axe

""You are hereby terminated.""

With those words, President Donald J Trump became only the second commander-in-chief to fire his FBI director.

He and officials from the Department of Justice were clear why they felt James Comey had to go - more on that later.

Democrats, however, have their doubts over the timing. And reports in the meantime do indicate there was more going on.

So what are the possible reasons for his departure?

1) The official reason - the Clinton emails

President Trump was given letters by his Attorney-General Jeff Sessions and Mr Sessions' deputy, Rod J Rosenstein, outlining what they saw as failures in Mr Comey's time in office.

Mr Rosenstein's letter says ""the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice"".

His letter focuses on the fallout from an FBI investigation, now closed, into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to store sensitive information while secretary of state.

""I cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,"" Mr Rosenstein goes on to say.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comey explains why he went public reopening Clinton email probe

So did Mr Comey act correctly?

""The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution,"" Mr Rosenstein's letter says.

Mr Comey chose to announce there would be no investigation because, the letter says, ""he believed attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict"".

While this was not customary, Mr Comey explained why he took the responsibility ahead of Mrs Lynch. He said he did it because she had recently generated adverse headlines by having a meeting with ex-President Bill Clinton on an airport runway. They said it was a casual encounter but she was accused of a conflict of interest.

It is also unusual for the FBI to go public with an investigation, especially during an election campaign. Mr Comey did that not once but twice. But he justified it by saying if he had not come forward, he could have been guilty of concealment.

What was Clinton FBI probe about?

Mrs Clinton's supporters cried foul when it emerged that the Trump election team was also under investigation by the FBI, but Mr Comey never divulged that until a long time after the election.

One key question though - if this was indeed the real reason Mr Comey was fired, why did the White House wait until now? The Clinton investigation was closed in early November, and Mr Trump has been in office since 20 January.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Mr Trump's letter dismissing Mr Comey was released by the White House

2) Russia

Mr Comey's public profile had risen recently in relation to the FBI's ongoing investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election (as well as possible links between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia).

In fact, Mr Comey confirmed that such an investigation existed only on 20 March, when he spoke before a congressional intelligence committee.

Nothing has come from this investigation yet; Mr Comey said the investigation was ""very complex"" and that he could not give a timetable for its completion.

But US intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin did order the hack against the DNC. And the Russia scandal has already claimed one Trump official - former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who was fired for not giving a correct account of his meetings with a Russian official.

The White House has consistently denied having links with Russia. But after Mr Comey's dismissal, Politico reported that the president ""had grown enraged by the Russia investigation"" and was ""frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia"".

""He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn't disappear and demanded they speak out for him,"" Politico reported. ""He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.""

Mr Comey had been due to appear before the senate intelligence committee to speak on Russia on Thursday - its chairman, Richard Burr, said he was ""troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination"".

Democrat former presidential contender Bernie Sanders also highlighted the fact the decision came a day after former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told a Senate committee of the concerns she had over Mr Flynn's Russia ties. He called the timing ""deeply troubling"".

3) He simply didn't like Comey

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

""He's become more famous than me!"" Mr Trump said when beckoning Mr Comey at a January meeting, sending an air-kiss his way.

But could this have been a problem, rather than a compliment?

Citing unnamed White House officials on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the two were a poor match, and that Mr Trump did not like the increased media attention on Mr Comey.

The fact Mr Comey had not publicly talked down links between the Trump campaign and Russia was also a source of tension, the Journal reported.

WASHINGTON — President Trump’s abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey triggered renewed calls this week from Democratic senators for the appointment of a special counsel or independent prosecutor to investigate ties between President Trump’s associates and Russia.

“If there was ever a time when circumstances warranted a special prosecutor, it is right now,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, a day after Comey’s dismissal.

But the power to appoint a special prosecutor rests with a key figure in the Trump administration who played a role in Comey’s firing.

While Attorney General Jeff Sessions has legal authority to make the appointment, he has recused himself from investigations relating to the 2016 campaign after his undisclosed conversations with Russia’s ambassador Sergey Kislyak came to light. As a result, the responsibility falls squarely on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote Tuesday’s memo justifying Comey’s removal.

During his confirmation hearings for the No. 2 post at the Department of Justice, Rosenstein refused to commit to Democrats’ calls for a special prosecutor to oversee the inquiry.

Syracuse University law professor William Banks said it’s unrealistic to expect action from Rosenstein. “Even if the deputy wanted to do this, he would be shot down by the White House, I imagine,” Banks said.

The options are limited for congressional Democrats.

A post-Watergate independent counsel law that gave Congress the authority to call on the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor lapsed in 1999. Passing a new version, much less with the margin needed to overturn a certain presidential veto, is unlikely in a GOP-controlled Congress, Banks said.

On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rejected the calls for an independent prosecutor. A new probe, he said, would “impede” an investigation already under way by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

6,White House: Trump thought about firing Comey since Election Day,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump had been t hinking about firing FBI Director James Comey since Election Day , White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.

""The President has lost confidence in Director Comey and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected,"" Sanders told reporters, adding that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had raised concerns about the former FBI chief on Monday, prompting Trump to ask him to put his recommendation in writing.

Revelations that Trump had been unconvinced by Comey for his entire transition and presidency were surprising given the White House had previously expressed confidence in the ousted FBI chief multiple times. Sanders also said Trump was not the only one to lose confidence in the FBI director, adding there were deep reservations about him inside the FBI.

Sanders also said that Trump didn't regret not firing Comey sooner, saying he ""wanted to give Director Comey a chance.""

She also pointed to a ""big catalyst"" from last week congressional testimony by the former FBI chief when he related how he held a news conference without notifying his superiors last year. In the blockbuster appearance, Comey announced that Hillary Clinton would not face charges over her email server but also heavily criticized her handling of classified material.

""Director Comey made a pretty startling revelation that he had essentially taken a stick of dynamite and thrown it into the Department of Justice by going around the chain of command,"" Sanders said.

""That is simply not allowed,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Comey asked the Justice Department for more resources for the agency's investigation into Russian meddling of the US election and ties to Trump's presidential campaign, just the week before the President fired him.

Comey told the heads of the Senate intelligence committee that he went to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week and pushed for more resources to be devoted to the Russia investigation, according to two sources familiar with the discussion.

Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Flores denies Comey asked Rosenstein for more resources. She called reporting to the contrary ""100% false,"" and told reporters she spoke directly with Rosenstein about the reports.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia met Monday with Comey and urged him to speed up the Russia investigation. Comey acknowledged in this discussion that things were moving slowly.

Warner told CNN Wednesday he has asked Comey to testify before the committee Tuesday. It is an invitation only at this point -- no word yet if he will appear.

Before Rosenstein, Comey had been working with the acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente. Comey's requests for funds was first reported by The New York Times

In the wake of Comey's firing, a fierce political battle has erupted, as Democrats step up demands for a special prosecutor but Republican leaders hold the line to shield the White House.

With Washington still in disbelief over Tuesday's dramatic events that sent shockwaves across the nation, Trump blasted criticism of his sudden move, declaring that the former FBI chief ""wasn't doing a good job.""

But the President's comments did little to dispel the controversy over the firing of Comey: the FBI director overseeing the bureau's probe into whether there were any links between Trump campaign aides and Russia at a time when Moscow is accused of meddling in last year's election.

Critics claimed that Trump was trying to shut down the FBI Russia investigation. They ridiculed the White House's rationale for the firing -- that it was over Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation that many Democrats believe cost the former secretary of state the presidency.

Trump's defense

The substantive push back was left to Vice President Mike Pence, who praised his boss for showing strong leadership to restore public confidence in the FBI and refuted suggestions the administration had anything to hide over Russia.

""President Trump made the right decision at the right time to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general, to ask for the termination, to support the termination of the director of the FBI,"" Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The vice president also reiterated the White House's line that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that there is no evidence to support the idea of collusion between Trump aides and Russia.

But he would not answer a question about whether the impetus for the report by Rosenstein that led to Comey's dismissal came from the White House or the Justice Department.

Pence's appearance before the cameras was a strategic decision of the White House to push back on the political crisis that ensued after Trump's move. The next White House official to face the public will be deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who will brief reporters at 1:30 p.m. ET.

Trump joined the counter attack on Twitter as he lambasted his critics and Democrats who are accusing him of an abuse of power.

""Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" Trump tweeted.

""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" Trump wrote, and said a new FBI director would do a far better job.

Congress' next steps

In a highly unusual move, large numbers of Democrats showed up for the opening of Senate business on Wednesday, as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for a closed briefing of all senators with Comey and renewed his calls for a special prosecutor.

""Nothing less is at stake than the American people's faith in our criminal justice system and the integrity of the executive branch of our government,"" Schumer said.

But Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sought to quell the rising pressure on the White House.

McConnell argued that Democrats were ""complaining"" about Comey's removal after having argued during the campaign that Comey had behaved unfairly toward Clinton.

""Partisan calls,"" he said, shouldn't slow down the investigation by the Senate intelligence committee.

However, some other Republican senators are expressing increasing concerns about the escalating political crisis and the firing of Comey.

Arizona Sen. John McCain renewed his calls for a special congressional committee to investigate allegations of Russian election meddling.

""When you fire probably, arguably, the most respected person in America you better have a very good explanation and so far I haven't seen that,"" McCain told CNN's Manu Raju.

McCain said the White House rationale that Comey was fired because of his handling over the investigation into Clinton's emails was not sufficient.

The surreal

Trump's demeanor suggested defiance on Wednesday but also verged on the surreal.

With questions swirling about his links with Russia, he met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Oval Office for talks he later said were dominated by Syria.

The Russian embassy, meanwhile, tweeted a picture of Trump shaking hands with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who is at the center of the Russia storm since his conversations with Michael Flynn led to the firing of the former national security adviser.

Then Trump sat down with Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under President Richard Nixon, apparently unconcerned that the photo-op could fuel already circulating allusions to the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.

Developments and revelations about the Comey firing tumbled out at a frenetic pace on Wednesday.

Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Stone, who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation, spoke to Trump after Comey appeared at a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, according to the source.

The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

Trump immediately disputed that Stone was involved: ""The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.""

Stone said he was not the source behind the reporting but added that he supported the firing of Comey ""100%.""

I am not the source of Politico/ CNN stories claiming I urged @realDonaldTrump 2 fire Comey. Never made such claim. I support decision 100% — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) May 10, 2017

A White House spokesperson reached out to CNN to reiterate the President's tweet that he has not spoken to Stone in a ""long time.""

""The President has not spoken to Roger Stone in many months and any reports suggesting otherwise are categorically untrue,"" the spokesperson said.

Career ended

Comey's dismissal ends a major chapter in a career of the man once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign.

In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was ""hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,"" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is ""not able to effectively lead the bureau.""

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark Tuesday night between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from Rosenstein , which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings.

But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public.

Trump's decision came on a day when CNN reported that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn seeking business records, as part of the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in last year's election, according to people familiar with the matter.

The top senators on the Senate intelligence committee, Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner, met Comey on Monday and urged him to speed up the Russia investigation, CNN's Sara Murray reported.

The search for Comey's successor is meanwhile already underway.

6,And then Henry Kissinger walks in...: 24 hours in the Donald Trump circus,"(CNN) Donald Trump promised a White House like no other when he pulled the biggest upset in presidential history to become the 44th man to hold the job. Man has he delivered.

From his Twitter feed to his dinner guests (Ted Nugent, Kid Rock and Sarah Palin -- all in one night!), the Trump White House has looked, and run, like nothing we've ever seen before.

But, even by Trump's standards, the last 24 hours has been surreal. In fact, the last day feels more like a reality TV show -- storyline twists and turns, surprise guest appearances -- than it does anything resembling a semi-normal day in political Washington.

Let's start with the present moment and then rewind.

The White House press pool was called into the Oval Office just before noon eastern time for what they expected to be a photo op between Trump and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov since the two men were scheduled to huddle earlier today.

But it wasn't Lavrov they found sitting with the president! It was Henry Kissinger, best known for his role as Secretary of State to President Richard Nixon!

Reporters asked Trump about the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Trump responded, briefly, that Comey was simply ""not doing a good job."" It was apparently lost on Trump that the last 16 hours had been dominated by comparisons between Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" -- where he jettisoned the independent counsel investigating Watergate -- and Trump's decision to part ways with Comey. Either that or Trump was pulling the greatest troll move ever by having Kissinger there when he took his first questions from reporters about the Comey firing. (I'm not ready to rule that option out.)

Speaking of Lavrov, he didn't make the Kissinger photo op but that doesn't mean we didn't see him. Shortly after the meeting with Trump, the Russian news agency TASS put out a series of pictures of the gathering. But, wait! There was a special guest with them. This guy:

In the event you have been under a pile of coats for the last 2 years or so, the guy next to Trump is Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Sergey Kislyak at the center of the FBI investigation into deposed national security adviser Michael Flynn. (Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak.) And, yes, the same Sergey Kislyak who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he had met with -- twice -- during the 2016 presidential campaign, a memory lapse that led him to recuse himself from the ongoing Russia investigation.

Whoops! I forgot to mention that in the midst of all of this, Vladimir Putin gave an interview about the Comey firing -- in full hockey gear

Before meeting with Kislyak and Lavrov -- and Kissinger -- Trump was watching cable TV. And lots of it. He tapped out a series of tweets regarding Comey and the way the firing was being covered beginning with this one right at 7:10 a.m. ET: ""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!""

(Trump has previously insisted he doesn't watch CNN because it is ""fake news."" He apparently has reconsidered that decision. Welcome back, Mr. President!)

Then, finally, go back to 6 p.m. ET last night when Trump shocked the world -- and, apparently, much of his administration and Congress -- when he jettisoned Comey with a letter hand-delivered to the FBI by his former bodyguard. (That sentence, in and of itself, is surreal.) The letter, which was four short paragraphs, included this amazing line: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.""

If Aaron Sorkin had written a ""West Wing"" episode with this many twists and turns, misdirections and shocking surprises, everyone in the writer's room would have rolled their eyes. Except this isn't a drama; it's real life. Or maybe reality life.

6,How the GOP reacted to Trump's Comey firing,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's sudden decision Tuesday to fire FBI Director James Comey has forced GOP lawmakers to decide whether to side with the White House on a move that comes in the middle of the FBI's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Here's how Republican lawmakers have reacted:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ""Our Democratic colleagues (are) complaining about the removal of an FBI director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized. ... Partisan calls should not delay the considerable work of Chairman (Richard) Burr and Vice Chairman (Mark) Warner. Too much is at stake.""

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina, in a statement: ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the committee. In my interactions with the director and with the bureau under his leadership, he and the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee. Director Comey has been more forthcoming with information than any FBI director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intelligence committees. His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.""

Sen. John McCain of Arizona to reporters: ""There will be more shoes to drop. There always are on these scandals.""

Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska in a statement: ""Regardless of how you think Director Comey handled the unprecedented complexities of the 2016 election cycle, the timing of this firing is very troubling. Jim Comey is an honorable public servant, and in the midst of a crisis of public trust that goes well beyond who you voted for in the presidential election, the loss of an honorable public servant is a loss for the nation. As the chairman of the Judiciary committee's oversight subcommittee, I have reached out to the deputy attorney general for clarity on his rationale for recommending this action.""

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to reporters: ""I would expect the FBI to continue to function along the lines that we have come to expect it to function.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on CNN's ""New Day"": ""I think Director Comey is a fine man, but Democrats called for his removal about two to three, four weeks ago and now he's gone and we get a chance to pick on a new director that hopefully we can all agree is above reproach.""

Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona to reporters: ""I just don't know why this happened now. I'm having trouble with it still. With regard to a special prosecutor, I'm looking to see how that would impact the Senate investigation that's going on. I have confidence in the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, so still reviewing.""

Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio in a statement: ""Given the timing and circumstances of the decision, I believe the White House should provide a fuller explanation regarding the President's rationale. The American people must have faith in a strong, independent FBI. I'm concerned about eroding trust in this premier law enforcement agency.""

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on Fox News: ""All they continue to ask for is more power to invade our phone calls and more power to invade our privacy. I was not a huge Comey fan.""

Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in a statement: ""Whether or not you are a supporter of Mr. James Comey's actions as FBI director, the timing of his firing -- in the middle of an investigation into Russia's interference in our election -- is serious cause for concern.""

Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee in a statement: ""It would have been easier to explain if the President had fired the FBI director earlier when Senator Schumer and other Democrats said they'd lost confidence in Mr. Comey.""

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota on CNN: ""The timing of all of this is something the administration will have to answer questions about.""

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in a statement: ""Today's announcement is likely the inevitable conclusion of Director Comey's decision last July to bypass the longstanding protocols of the Justice Department and publicly announce the reasons he had decided not to recommend an indictment of Hillary Clinton and to offer his personal views of Mrs. Clinton's actions.

""That decision, while well-intentioned, embroiled Director Comey into political controversies that unfortunately continued to this day.

""Any suggestion that today's announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBI's investigation of Russia's attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced. The President did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director. I have every confidence that the FBI will continue to pursue its investigation. In addition, I am certain that the Senate Intelligence Committee, on which I serve, will continue its own bipartisan investigation and will follow the evidence wherever it leads.""

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia: ""The FBI is the premier law enforcement agency in the world and it is critical to have a director who holds the trust of the American people. It is clearly the President's prerogative to remove the FBI director, as was recommended by the top two officials at the Department of Justice.""

Rep. Rod Blum of Iowa, at a town hall meeting: ""I think it's probably time for Comey to go. The FBI has been way too involved in politics -- both sides of the aisle. Been too politicized. And the president has every authority under the constitution to terminate the director of the FBI. So, I'm supportive of that decision.""

Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan in a tweet: ""My staff and I are reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia. The second paragraph of this letter is bizarre."" : ""My staff and I are reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia. The second paragraph of this letter is bizarre.""

Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia: ""Both Democrats and Republicans attacked the FBI Director at various times for various reasons and called for his ouster. However, I can't defend or explain tonight's actions or timing of the firing of FBI Director James Comey. The FBI investigation into the Russian impact on the 2016 election must continue. There must be an independent investigation that the American people can trust.""

Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida in a statement: ""Today's extraordinary decision raises many questions all of which must be answered. Congress and the American people need a transparent explanation as to how this decision was reached and why it was executed at this time. It is critical that the FBI can continue all of its pending work with independence and integrity -- especially the investigation into the Russian government's efforts to influence our last election and undermine American democracy. Today I reiterate the need for Congress to establish a select committee with full investigatory powers to thoroughly examine this matter.""",cnn

President Donald Trump had been considering firing former FBI Director James Comey since he was elected, a White House spokeswoman has said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that there was an ""erosion of confidence"" in Mr Comey over the last year after several missteps.

The administration says Mr Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry.

But Democrats say it is because he was probing alleged Russia-Trump links.

During a news conference on Wednesday, Ms Huckabee Sanders also accused the former FBI chief of ""throwing a stick of dynamite"" into the Department of Justice.

The White House spokeswoman raised eyebrows among the press corps by saying that Mr Comey had committed ""atrocities, circumventing the chain of command"".

Ms Huckabee Sanders also rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor to the FBI investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election.

""We don't think it's necessary,"" she said. ""No one wants this to be finished and completed more than us.""

Top Democrat Senator Mark Warner said the panel had so far ""not heard back"".

Washington is still shaking from the aftershocks of Mr Comey's unexpected dismissal.

The move ""raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,"" said Adam Schiff, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

But the president stood by his actions on Wednesday during a surprise meeting with Henry Kissinger, saying Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"".

His first in-person explanation for his actions came before a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak - his first with any Russian official since taking power.

It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.

'Not good optics' - Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

If Donald Trump is trying to avoid comparisons with Richard Nixon's scandal-plagued presidency, welcoming Henry Kissinger - the man probably most closely connected with the former president - in the Oval Office probably isn't the best move.

The whole group meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was a bit strange, starting with the fact that it happened at all. Given the allegations that Mr Trump fired James Comey because of the FBI investigation into Russia ties to the Trump campaign, meeting with a Russian ambassador the very next day isn't exactly good optics, as they say.

Neither is keeping US media out of the room and having Russian state photographers provide the only public images of the event - images that are sure to be featured in Democratic campaign adverts in the not-too-distant future.

During the campaign, Mr Trump famously joked that he could shoot somebody, and his supporters would stick by him. Smiling with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a growing Russian hacking controversy is the diplomatic equivalent - a brazen move sans firearms.

Russian and the US are looking to ""remove all the barriers"" to having a better relationship, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said.

He said he thought Moscow's relations with the current administration would be better than with the previous one.

Mr Lavrov was speaking after talks in Washington with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

The meetings came a day after the US president fired FBI director James Comey.

Mr Comey was leading an investigation into alleged Russian interference in last year's US election.

Clearly impatient with journalists' repeated questions about Mr Comey, Mr Lavrov rejected claims that Moscow had intervened in the presidential election as ""fabrications"".

A key topic of conversation at the meetings was the war in Syria, in particular a Russian plan to create ""safe zones"". Mr Lavrov praised the talks with Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson as ""constructive"".

The US administration has broadly welcomed the Russian plan, but has expressed wariness about Moscow's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the role of Iran - and Iranian proxy forces - in the country.

US officials say they need to hear more about who would patrol the proposed zones, and how they would be enforced.

Oval Office honour

Mr Lavrov told journalists: ""I would say that our dialogue as of now is free from ideology that was very typical for [Barack] Obama's administration.

""Both Mr Trump and the secretary of state of his administration, as I realised today once again, are businesslike people and they want to reach agreements.

""The goal of both President Trump and [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin is to have concrete results which will be tangible and which will allow us to alleviate problems, including on the international agenda.""

The images show the phone from all angles, and highlight a metal frame and a shiny glass back, making for a marked departure from the metal-backed iPhone 7.

There’s also a vertically aligned dual-lens camera, in place of the horizontally aligned one on the iPhone 7 Plus. This has been rumored before and it’s thought that the change could somehow be needed to help with rumored augmented reality functions of the phone.

Big screen, small body

The port and button placement largely seems similar to what’s gone before though, with two speaker grilles and a Lightning port on the bottom edge, a power button on the right edge and volume buttons on the left.

Apparently the iPhone 8 pictured here has dimensions of 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm, which would make it slightly bigger in all dimensions than the 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm iPhone 7, but smaller (though still slightly thicker) than the iPhone 7 Plus.

Despite that it will probably have a bigger screen than either, with many current rumors pointing to a 5.8-inch display, achieved by removing the home button and having an all-screen front, as you can also see in these images.

The source of this leak theorizes that the fingerprint scanner could instead be built either into the display itself, as has been rumored a number of times, or into the Apple logo on the back.

These images largely line up with a dummy unit we saw previously. That too was supposedly based on leaked designs, so the source diagrams could be the same.

These latest images were sourced for MySmartPrice by @OnLeaks, who is one of the more reputable leakers in the business, but they themselves aren’t certain that this will be the iPhone 8’s final form, as Apple has apparently been working on a number of prototypes, so this could end up being an unused design.

We might not know for sure until September, when the iPhone 8 is expected to be officially announced.",techradar
10,Windows 10 HomeHub looks to turn all-in-one PCs into the best smart speakers,"Microsoft apparently will confront the rise of smart speakers with a new kind of all-in-one PC, judging from leaked images and details of a Windows 10 HomeHub experience provided to The Verge.

HomeHub, which first leaked late last year, is essentially an enhanced version of the Windows 10 lock screen that allows for deeper voice controls through Cortana and more pertinent information than any Windows lock screen has provided.

Of course, the idea is for this new HomeHub overlay to be released in tandem with slightly specialized all-in-one computers through its device manufacturing partners, computers deliberately designed to be placed in kitchens and living rooms.

Citing internal sources, The Verge reports that HomeHub will act as an always-on experience for touchscreen all-in-one PCs, with a digital drawing board being one of its primary features. The suspicion is that Microsoft is working with partners on devices comparable to that of the newly-minted Amazon Echo Show.

However, those sources also allegedly say that any device running Windows 10 HomeHub must be a full PC, as that’s to be one of Microsoft’s key advantages over existing and future smart speakers.

Finally, a place for the PC again

Microsoft’s goal here seems to provide a compelling reason to bring all-in-one PCs that were so popular decades ago back into consumers’ houses where laptops, tablets and phones have ruled for years. Further to that point will be features like calendar management, sticky notes and to-do lists as well as voice calls (likely through Skype).

To really cement in whole “HomeHub” idea, the feature is expected to support Hue, Nest, Insteon, Wink and SmartThings devices, with Cortana able to issue commands to said devices.

According to The Verge’s sources, Microsoft plans for these features to arrive in Windows 10 with the forthcoming autumn update due in September. As a follow-up, Microsoft reportedly expects HP and Lenovo to have such devices ready for the holiday rush.

As for when we’ll officially see Windows 10 HomeHub and the various devices in which it will live, either Microsoft Build 2017 or its May 23 Surface event are fine guesses.

10,Would you let a robot perform your eye surgery? One just passed clinical trials,"The idea of having your eyes operated on is a pretty terrifying proposal at the best of times, but throw robot surgeons into the mix and it suddenly feels very James Bond. But robot optical surgery is now a very real possibility thanks to the University of Oxford in the UK.

For the first time a robot has passed clinical trials to perform highly delicate retinal surgery, meaning it could soon become a fixture in hospital wards. The robot, named R2D2 (yes, really) outperformed its human counterparts in the control group.

The reason that a robot is proving so effective in this field is the microscopic level of movement needed to perform the surgery, well outside the capabilities of even the most competent surgeon.

Talking to the BBC about the Robotic Retinal Dissection Device (R2D2), the program’s director Dr Robert MacLaren said: “Current technology with laser scanners and microscopes allows us to monitor retinal diseases at the microscopic level, but the things we see are beyond the physiological limit of what the human hand can operate on.

""With a robotic system, we open up a whole new chapter of eye operations that currently cannot be performed.”

Slow and steady

In order to operate on a retina, an incision 10 microns deep at the back of the eye is necessary. For reference, a human hair averages at about 60 microns. As precise as human surgeons are, even the pulse of their heart is enough to move their hand more than 10 microns.

The clinical trial took the form of 12 retina membrane removal operations, 6 by human surgeons, 6 by R2D2. In the group operated on by the human surgeons, there were five micro-hemorrhages (minor bleeds) and two retinal touches, which we feel a bit queasy just writing. In comparison, R2D2 only had two micro-hemorrhages and one retinal touch.

If it helps set your mind at ease, the robot is still controlled by a human surgeon so it isn’t deciding where and when to cut, yet.

10,Windows 10 S will be locked to Edge browser – Chrome won’t be an option,"Never mind Microsoft Edge being locked as the default browser in Windows 10 S, as we heard last week – it's now emerged that Edge's biggest rival, and the most popular desktop web browser in the world, Chrome, won’t even be available to install on the lightweight version of Microsoft’s desktop OS.

As we discussed last week, the central point of Windows 10 S is to restrict the operating system to apps from the Windows Store so Microsoft can better police security – but as spotted by ZDNet, the store’s policies will actually forbid Chrome (or other third-party browsers, such as Firefox) from gaining entry.

Several sections in the list of Windows Store policies call for apps to “not jeopardize or compromise user security” (unsurprisingly), but more to the point, specify that: “Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate HTML and JavaScript engines provided by the Windows Platform.”

So if Google did want to turn Chrome into a universal app for use with Windows 10 S, the browser wouldn’t be able to use its own engines. In other words, it wouldn’t be Chrome anymore, but just a shell of Google’s browser using Microsoft’s HTML and JavaScript engines.

ZDNet also cited a developer who had sent their Chromium-based desktop browser to be approved by Microsoft, and had it refused, being told that browsers represent a particular security risk, and that: “They are secure only if, like Edge, they're true UWP apps, so they run in a sandbox environment and they don't have access to the overall system.”

The upshot of all this is that while these store policies remain in place, Chrome – and indeed other third-party browsers – won’t be coming to Windows 10 S. Or at least, if they do, the apps in question will only be superficial lookalikes.

The best laptops for college all run full Windows 10 and macOS

Fair turnabout?

As we touched on last week, you could argue this is fair turnabout: Google did, after all, build Chrome OS around its own browser, and it’s also a locked-down ecosystem (although these days, if you have one of the Chromebooks that support Android apps it’s theoretically possible to use a third-party browser, although there’s no guarantee it'll function smoothly).

And Microsoft is certainly arguing that this is an important move in terms of the security of Windows 10 S, which is also a fair point. But it’s clearly also a major advantage for the company to keep its browser rivals away from its desktop OS.

Microsoft further notes that folks can simply shift over to the full-fat version of Windows if they want more choice. The company stated: “If people would like to access apps from other stores and services, they can switch to Windows 10 Pro at any time.”

It’s also worth bearing in mind that as well as Edge being locked as the default browser on Windows 10 S, Bing is locked as the default search engine, so you can’t switch to Google for your searches either.",techradar
6,"Donald Trump, Richard Nixon and Watergate: What's the same and what's different?","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, is drawing comparisons to a controversial figure from 44 years past, President Nixon. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains. Buzz60

The comparisons between President Richard Nixon, the Watergate scandal that helped end his presidency and President Trump are coming with an increasing frequency these days, particularly after Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey Monday.

Watergate refers to the all-encompassing series of scandals that engulfed Nixon starting with the June 17, 1972, failed break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington's Watergate office complex. Five men, including four Cuban exiles affiliated with the CIA and James McCord, the security director of Nixon's 1972 re-election committee, were caught inside the DNC offices with bugging equipment and photographs.

By the time Nixon resigned and left office on Aug. 9, 1974, the scandal had become a catalog of many of Nixon's abuses of power. They included FBI wiretaps of 17 government officials and journalists, a 1970 plan to relax internal security procedures to track suspected subversives, the existence of a secret White House special investigations unit called the Plumbers, the secret bombing of Cambodia and a wide-ranging dirty tricks program run by the Nixon 1972 campaign team against potential Democratic opponents.

The final straw was the release of June 23, 1972, tape of a conversation between Nixon and his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, in which Nixon approved a plan to use the CIA to block the FBI's investigation of the Watergate break-in.

The Trump campaign and some of his associates are being investigated by the FBI and two congressional committees for possible involvement in the Russian-led hacking of the Democratic National Committee's email system and the transfer of those emails to the online site WikiLeaks, which posts secret government and political documents online.Nothing so far that links Trump personally to the hacking or leaks.

So, what are the similarities and similarities between the Trump White House and Nixon's?

Similarities

• Firing investigators. By May 1973, a special prosecutor was appointed by Attorney General Elliot Richardson to investigate potential crimes stemming from the Watergate break-in and subsequent White House cover-up of its involvement. Richardson, a former secretary of Defense and Health, Education and Welfare, appointed his former mentor from Harvard Law School, Archibald Cox. A former solicitor general for President John Kennedy, a Nixon nemesis, Cox quickly angered the Nixon White House with its demands for documents and tapes of Nixon's conversations in the White House, the existence of which was revealed in July.

On Oct. 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson refused and resigned. Nixon then asked Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, to fire Cox, He, too, refused and resigned. Solicitor General Robert Bork, the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, agreed to fire Cox, reasoning that Nixon would just roll through the entire department until he found someone willing to get rid of Cox. Those firings, called the Saturday Night Massacre, increased calls for Nixon's impeachment.

On Monday, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, saying that he had lost confidence in Comey's ability to run the FBI because of how he handled last year's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server on which some classified government documents were sent. Comey's firing spurred immediate comparisons to the Cox firing, because the FBI is also investigating connections between Trump's campaign and administration with Russia and its interference in the 2016 elections.

• Embattled White House spokesmen. Nixon's press secretary, Ronald Ziegler, became notorious for his briefings in which he tried to explain the constantly changing explanations from the White House about the involvement of administration officials in the Watergate break-in and cover-up. During one briefing, Ziegler said his previous, inaccurate statements were ""inoperative.""

Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, has struggled to deal with the president's numerous tweets and inaccurate statements. On Tuesday, he reportedly told television camera operators to turn off their lights as he and other members of the White House press team tried to explain the Comey firing.

• Campaign dirty tricks. Nixon's campaign hired young political operatives to disrupt the operations of several Democratic candidates for president in 1972. They included, as the Washington Post wrote on Oct. 10, 1972, ""Following members of Democratic candidates' families and assembling dossiers on their personal lives; forging letters and distributing them under the candidates' letterheads; leaking false and manufactured items to the press; throwing campaign schedules into disarray; seizing confidential campaign files; and investigating the lives of dozens of Democratic campaign workers.""

The Trump campaign benefited from a Russian plan to destabilize the U.S. elections last year, which included the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails by a hacker called Guccifer 2.0. Those emails were then given to the online leak site WikiLeaks and distributed online over a period of weeks during the height of the general election campaign. Roger Stone, an alumnus of the 1972 Nixon campaign and a longtime Trump adviser, spoke often during the campaign of impending WikiLeaks email dumps and their effect on the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

In each case, it was never proved the Nixon knew in advance about his campaign's dirty tricks or that Trump had any knowledge of the connections of people affiliated with his campaign with the Russian government or its agents.

Differences

• There is no special prosecutor. Yet. Nixon was forced to agree to the appointment of Cox and his successor, high-powered Houston lawyer Leon Jaworski to lead a special prosecution team of Watergate-related crimes because of charges that the Justice Department was too politically compromise to investigate the president who had appointed its top officers.

Claims of political bias exist now, but so far neither Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions or key Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have endorsed calling for a special prosecutor into the Russia hacking case. Sessions has recused himself from any role in the Russia investigation, citing his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which Sessions failed to acknowledge during his Senate confirmation hearings. Any special prosecutor in that case would have to be appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but he and Sessions both were involved in the firing of FBI director Comey.

• Congressional control. In 1973, Congress was controlled by Democrats, who had long distrusted Republican Nixon for a series of political maneuvers over the course of his political career, which started in 1946. Senate Democrats called for the creation of a special committee, the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, to investigate the claims of dirty tricks and the White House connection to the Watergate break-in. After the Saturday Night Massacre, calls for impeachment proceedings for Nixon picked up steam. By the summer of 1974, the House Judiciary Committee was considering multiple articles of impeachment against Nixon.

This year, however, the White House and Congress are controlled by Republicans, and congressional leadership has been quiet in calling for a special prosecutor or a deeper investigation into the Trump administration. However, the GOP-controlled Senate and House intelligence committees are investigating the Trump campaign and the Russian hacking. The Senate investigation, led by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., has been noted for its cooperation with Senate Democrats, particularly Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, while the House probe has been stalled by political squabbling and the recusal of the panel's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, for his meetings with Trump officials.

6,Comey fired before Justice Department could complete internal probe into his election actions,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

WASHINGTON— President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey before the Justice Department's inspector general could complete a wide-ranging review of his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation.

Two weeks before Trump's inauguration, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz took the extraordinary step of publicly announcing a review into the FBI's inquiry into Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of State.

Trump, along with Justice Department leadership, said Tuesday they fired Comey for his controversial handling the Clinton case.

But the fact that Comey was fired as the official review of his actions was still ongoing is raising serious questions among congressional leaders and legal analysts about the speed with which Attorney General Jeff Sessions and newly-confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended Comey’s dismissal.

Democrat and some Republican lawmakers directly challenged the timing of of the director's abrupt firing, suggesting that it could be an attempt to redirect attention away from the FBI and congressional investigations analyzing possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

""The timing and reasoning incites people to believe that something is being covered up,'' said North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is reviewing Russian interference in the 2016 elections along with the House Intelligence Committee.

An ""incredulous'' California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on Trump and the Justice Department to explain why there was little reference to the looming Russia investigation in Comey's dismissal.

""If the reason for firing Comey was his handling of the Clinton investigation, why now?'' Feinstein asked.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, specifically referenced the inspector general's investigation, saying that review could have brought an independent assessment of Comey's fate.

""Why didn't the president wait for the conclusion of the inspector general's investigation?'' Schumer said Wednesday. ""There is little reason to believe that Mr. Rosenstein's letter is the true reason Mr. Comey was dismissed.''

In a three-page memo to Sessions outlining the case for Comey's removal, released by the White House, Rosenstein offered a scathing account of the director's management of the Clinton investigation. Rosenstein specifically took issue with Comey's unusual July news conference that the FBI was recommending Clinton not be prosecuted, and later public announcement just 11 days before the November election that he was re-opening the inquiry.

""I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,'' Rosenstein wrote. ""As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understand the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.''

The written assessment, assembled during Rosenstein's first 10 days on the job, did not, however, mention the ongoing inspector general's inquiry that had been underway for nearly five months – and was being directed from a suite offices on the same floor as the new deputy attorney general.

That's not because it was secret. In fact, the Justice Department's investigation was strikingly public.

The launch of such internal Justice inquiries are rarely accompanied by a press release, but Horowitz, the inspector general, felt it necessary because of the cascade of requests for an investigation that poured in from lawmakers and even members of the public.

As attention turned to the bumpy transition to the Trump administration, little more was said about the internal probe that promised an exhumation of events that Clinton has claimed helped doom her bid for the White House – until last week. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where then-FBI Director James Comey offered an animated defense of the Clinton case.

He also turned more than few heads when he randomly acknowledged that the inspector general interview, but indicated that there may be a need for follow-up questioning.

""Lordy, has this been painful,'' Comey said of the firestorm prompted by his actions in the Clinton case. ""I've gotten all kinds of rocks thrown at me, and this has been really hard. But I think I've down the right thing.''

Horowitz has declined to comment on the course of the review and the timing of its projected conclusion, but a team of investigators has been gathering documents and seeking witness interviews.

Among those also likely to be questioned include former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump while serving as acting attorney general during the initial days of the Trump administration. Yates' Jan. 30 dismissal followed her refusal to direct Justice attorneys to defend the president's controversial travel ban.

Ron Hosko, a former assistant FBI director who is familiar the inspector general process, said the Trump administration would have been better served had it waited for the completion of Horowitz's probe.

""I can clearly see the reasoning for Rosenstein's stated conclusions,'' Hosko said. ""The director went too far. He usurped the role of a prosecutor by recommending that charges not be filed against the secretary. That's all true. And it was true five months ago.

""The timing of this decision is indeed questionable,'' Hosko said. ""They (Trump administration officials) had the opportunity to hang their decision on the back of the IG investigation. Why they didn't only raises questions about their motives.""

What's more, Hosko said ""the way they did it"" – allowing Comey to learn of his firing from media reports – ""was insulting to him and to the entire FBI.""

The NCAA said 17 Division I teams across a variety of sports will be ineligible for postseason play in 2017-18 as a result of low Academic Progress Rate (APR) scores, down from 23 last year.

The APR measures eligibility and progress toward graduation for athletes, and schools must achieve a score of 930 (out of 1,000) to avoid penalties.

Teams ruled ineligible for the postseason tilt heavily toward Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including the men’s basketball programs at Alabama A&M, Grambling and Savannah State. Four teams at Southern University will miss the 2017-18 postseason including men’s baseball, men’s cross country, men’s track and women’s cross country.

However, the NCAA said overall average scores at HBCUs have improved from 916 to 956 since 2010. For the last two years, the NCAA has allowed teams from HBCUs and “limited resource” universities to avoid some penalties by meeting specific academic criteria including a graduation rate for athletes that exceeds the student body at large.

DI student-athletes improved in the classroom for the 13th straight year, according to the Academic Progress Rate: https://t.co/XAbvlCLJh3pic.twitter.com/FyJy2gDwUy — NCAA (@NCAA) May 10, 2017

The NCAA has also allocated additional money to underfunded schools to aid in academic support.

The most high-profile school facing penalties is Southeast Missouri State, whose men’s basketball team is banned from the 2017-18 postseason.

According to the NCAA, the overall four-year APR for the 2015-16 academic year is 981, up two points from last year. Football increased from 959 to 962, while men’s basketball improved from 964 to 966.

From the NCAA report:

The specific penalties for each team are listed on the school’s report in the APR searchable database.

Level One penalties focus on practice restrictions, which provide additional time for teams to focus on academics. Teams facing this penalty lose four hours and one day of practice time per week in season, which is intended to be replaced with academic activities. In 2017-18, 16 teams face this level of penalty.

Level Two penalties include the Level One penalty and a reduction of four hours of practice time out of season, which is intended to be replaced with academic activities. At Level Two, the team’s nonchampionship season, or spring football, is eliminated. Teams without nonchampionship seasons face a reduced number of contests. In 2017-18, 10 teams fall into this category.

3,Erdogan rips U.S. plan to arm Kurds; Mattis downplays Turkey rift,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The YPG is a dominant force within the Syrian Democratic Forces. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

The United States must support its NATO ally Turkey and reverse its decision to arm Syrian Kurds in the battle against the Islamic State, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday.

Erdogan rebuffed U.S. efforts to downplay the ambitious military plan announced Tuesday, saying he would take up the issue with President Trump when they meet in Washington next week.

""A terrorist group cannot be defeated with another one,"" Erdogan said. “I want to believe that Turkey's allies will side with us, not with terrorist organizations.”

Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was confident the U.S. can resolve tensions with Turkey, promising to ""work very closely with Turkey in support of their security.""

U.S. officials said Tuesday that Trump approved directly arming the Syrian Democratic Forces, about 50,000 fighters almost evenly divided between Arabs and Kurds. The SDF will be a driving force in the effort to repel ISIS militants from their last major Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. The Kurdish YPG organization, which Turkey views as a terrorist group, is a driving force in the SDF.

Read more:

Turkey says Arabs, not Kurds, should lead the effort to take back Raqqa and wants the Kurds removed from the complicated military equation. The U.S. decision to arm the Kurds drew an outcry across Turkey. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stressed that ""every weapon they (Kurds) obtain is a threat to Turkey.""

Prime Minister Binali Yidirim said the U.S. still has the ""opportunity"" to alter its position.

“If a negative decision is taken, its consequences will not only be against Turkey but have a negative impact on the U.S., too,” Yidirim said.

Turkish leaders thus far have declined to detail what steps Turkey might take. The U.S. flies military strikes against the Islamic State out of Incirlik, a Turkish base.

Turkey views the YPG as an arm of the leftist Kurdistan Workers' Party, which for decades has pressed a violent struggle for Kurdish self-determination in Turkey. Turkey, the U.S. and European Union all view the Kurdistan Workers' Party as a terrorist group.

The Pentagon policy had been to provide arms only to Arab fighters. The Kurds, however, have proven to be a formidable fighting force. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement Tuesday that arming the entire SDF was ""necessary to ensure a clear victory over ISIS in Raqqa,"" but stressed that Washington understood Turkish security concerns.

“We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the U.S. is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our NATO ally,” White said.

Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli dismissed the U.S. reassurances, saying Wednesday that Ankara cannot accept a NATO ally supporting the Kurdish fighters.

“We cannot accept the presence of terrorist organizations that would threaten the future of the Turkish state,"" Canikli said. ""We hope the U.S. administration will put a stop to this wrong and turn back away from it. Such a policy will not be beneficial, you can’t be in the same sack as terrorist organizations.""

He was given a second chance by the Patriots last year after he was arrested for an “extreme DUI,” but Floyd never took full advantage. He caught only four passes for 42 yards in two games with the Patriots, leading to his availability in free agency.

With the Cardinals, he showed flashes of being a good No. 2 receiver. In 2013, he caught 65 passes for 1,041 yards and five touchdowns, proving to be a solid deep threat in the passing game.

Floyd hasn’t eclipsed 1,000 yards since and saw his production decrease dramatically in 2016 (37 catches, 488 yards).",fox-sports

9,Maria Sharapova blasts Genie Bouchard without saying a word | FOX Sports,"While Genie Bouchard was putting Maria Sharapova on blast for having the gall to return to the sport after dutifully serving a harsh drug suspension, the five-time Grand Slam champion stayed quiet, refusing to enter the fray. She didn’t bite on questions about the critical comments made by Bouchard or other peers and when she lost to Bouchard in a second-round match this week at the Madrid Open, Sharapova kept on driving the high road, offering a “well done” at the net only to be met with an icy stare from Bouchard, who was awfully pleased with herself in press.

The matter appeared to be put to bed, at least until the next time the two play, until Sharapova threw some of the stealthiest shade imaginable, all with a single tap of a button. It’s glorious.

So, Sharapova has a book coming out in September. It’s called Unstoppable: My Life So Far and is being touted as a memoir about “sacrifice” and “a girl and her father and their crazy adventure.” In recent weeks, Sharapova has occasionally tweeted pictures of the cover.

Then, on Tuesday, one day after the match, a Photoshopped image that appeared to come from this Twitter page made its way around the online tennis community, spoofing the Sharapova cover and her new nemesis.

Get your copy of Genie's book at Barnes & Noble today! #bookcoversmaybe pic.twitter.com/rKYz70gwp2 — The Drive Volley (@thedrivevolley) May 9, 2017

Oh, that’s quite good. A little on the nose maybe but a nice rallying cry for the pro-Masha crowd.

And that was that; just another normal day on Twitter … until:

And … gold. The picture clearly made its way to Sharapova who clearly enjoyed it. Rather than retweet it out to her 5.67 million followers or comment on it, which essentially does the same thing, Sharapova went for the simple “like” option. The benefit of “like” is that the post doesn’t show up on any of Sharapova’s three main pages (tweets; tweets & replies; and media), which helps her maintain a sort of plausible online deniability. Checking to see somebody’s likes isn’t a normal part of the Twitter experience, especially if using Tweetdeck or the phone app. It’s the sort of thing that would go unnoticed by almost everybody – maybe a couple hundred people would have seen it – until one person shares it with everybody else.

The message is still the same. Finally, it’s a counterattack, if only an unspoken one. The whole thing has a sort of impishness that’s classic Sharapova, tacitly saying that all of this is on her terms. She’ll make a small statement like this but won’t provide the soundbite that’ll be replayed ad nauseam. It’s not overt enough to be a salvo but it’s definitive enough to be an ethos. It’s the opposite of Bouchard telling a Turkish TV station that Sharapova should never play tennis again or Serena Williams taking not-at-all-veiled shot at Sharapova in a 2013 Rolling Stone interview. Subtlety is a lost art.

Bouchard had it coming. In addition to the “cheater” who should never “be allowed to play that sport again” from two weeks ago, the 23-year-old Canadian, who was on a seven-match losing streak entering Madrid, said this after defeating Sharapova (in case the scoreline and her Oval Office-like power handshake and icy stare at the net didn’t get the point across):

“Some girls in the locker room are coming up to me and really wishing me good luck before matches, which doesn’t normally happen to me. It showed me that most people have my opinion, and they were just maybe scared to speak out. But privately, you know, I’ve gotten a lot of support.”

That’s some kind of delusional self-martyrdom. (And there’s some doubt about how many people texted, called or approached her – Simona Halep, the former world No. 2, shot her involvement down with such glee: “I didn’t wish good luck to Bouchard because we don’t speak, actually. She’s different.”) Bouchard is a hero because she beat a rusty Sharapova in a second-round match at a second-tier tournament? Maybe in her world, where Sharapova’s cheating, wild cards, unpopularity and status as a fallen idol has become her personal cause, keeping the sport safe from over-the-counter drug users who tested positive for a substance that had been legal 27 days before.

All those insults, all those digs, all those words. And then Sharapova got the final one, without saying a thing.",fox-sports

6,Source close to Comey says there were 2 reasons the FBI director was fired,"Washington (CNN) There are two reasons why President Donald Trump fired James Comey, according to a source close to the now-former FBI director:

The official White House version of what happened is that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russian investigation.

Rosenstein, in his memo, faulted Comey for being unfair to Clinton when he announced his conclusion last July that the case against Clinton should be closed without prosecution. He also criticized Comey for holding a press conference in which he ""Release(d) derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

The official version of the firing is that the President took the advice of the deputy attorney general, who ever since Attorney General Sessions' recusal, oversees the director of the FBI.

""This whole thing is very simple -- you're trying to make it very complex,"" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on CNN Tuesday morning. ""This is a president who saw that the FBI director had lost the public confidence, the confidence of Republicans and Democrats.""

JUST WATCHED Kellyanne Conway's heated New Day interview Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kellyanne Conway's heated New Day interview 19:24

But we know from his public statements that Trump does not share any of Rosenstein's concerns that Comey was unfair to Clinton. In fact, he faulted Comey for the opposite -- for not criminally charging Clinton.

In addition to that fact, Rosenstein's memo was dated May 9, Tuesday -- but White House officials tell CNN the president had been considering firing Comey since he took office, but most intensely for at least a week before Tuesday's fateful decision. Comey testified May 3 to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Clinton email investigation and the Russia election investigation

If only there was some way for us to see what was on the President's mind in real time last week.

Oh right -- there's Twitter....

Let's take a look at the President's late-night tweetstorm of twitter May 2, just before Comey's testimony.

""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...""

FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

""...Trump/russia story was an excuse used by the democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps trump just ran a great campaign?""

...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2017

Moreover, the letter the President wrote to Comey firing him includes zero references to the Clinton investigation and one big one about the Russia investigation.

The White House does not seem to like any questions about this.

""You want to question the timing of when the President fires, when he hires. It's inappropriate,"" said Conway Wednesday. ""He'll do it when he wants to, just like he fired FBI Director Comey when he was faced with evidence that was unignorable.""

Except of course that evidence about how Comey had treated the Clinton investigation was quite ignorable for the President for more than three months after he took office or until he needed a reason to fire him.

One other point to be questioned has to do with the role of Sessions, who officially removed himself from the Russia investigation as it related to US political campaigns after it became clear he had not been forthcoming about his meetings during the presidential campaign with the Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Still, he cited his own ties to the Trump campaign as the reason for his recusal.

""I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States,"" Sessions said back in March.

Except that recusal oddly does not appear to have been in effect when Sessions forwarded the letter from his deputy, Rosenstein, to the President and separately called for Comey to be fired. And it is not in apparent effect now as we're told Sessions is leading the search Comey's replacement.",cnn

Don't call this deal a blockhead move.

Children's programming firm and Teletubbies owner DHX Media said Wednesday that it had acquired a controlling stake in the Peanuts brand and other assets through a purchase of Iconix Brand Group's entertainment unit.

DHX said it had agreed to pay $345 million for the assets, which included an 80% stake in legendary cartoonist Charles Schulz's Peanuts and 100% of the Strawberry Shortcake brand.

Family of the late Schulz will continue to hold a 20% stake in the Peanuts brand, whose characters include Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Lucy.

Jean Schulz, the comic strip creator's widow, and son Craig Schulz endorsed the deal.

Among the assets DHX Media gets through the transaction are more than 340 half-hour segments of content. The company said it had identified opportunities to ""mine an underexploited library for global distribution and expansion into new territories and channels,"" including YouTube.

“Over the past 10 years, DHX Media has become a global leader in children’s entertainment content, building scale across production, distribution and consumer products and is perfectly positioned to benefit from the incredible growth of streaming services, worldwide,” DHX CEO Dana Landry said in a statement.

""Peanuts and Strawberry Shortcake have widespread, evergreen appeal that make them ideal for layering onto this platform, complementing our 450-title library, and significantly increasing our scale in consumer products.""

9,Atletico Madrid 2-1 Real Madrid (agg 2-4),"Isco's goal means Real Madrid have scored in 61 consecutive games across all competitions

Defending champions Real Madrid held off a spirited Atletico Madrid to set up a meeting with Juventus in next month's Champions League final in Cardiff.

Atletico, trailing 3-0 from the first leg, stormed into an early 2-0 lead on the night through Saul Niguez's header and Antoine Griezmann's cheeky penalty.

But Real grabbed a vital away goal when Isco smashed in a rebound after Toni Kroos' fierce shot was saved.

It checked Atletico's momentum and left them needing three more goals to reach a third Champions League final in four seasons.

Chances were scarcer for both teams after the break, although home substitute Kevin Gameiro missed two presentable chances to give Atletico a glimmer of hope.

Zinedine Zidane's team, attempting to become the first team to win the Champions League twice in a row, will meet Juventus at the Principality Stadium on Saturday, 3 June.

Too little, too late for Atletico

Most people thought this tie was a foregone conclusion after Atletico were outclassed at the Bernabeu eight days ago.

Los Rojiblancos, who managed just one shot on target in a limp away performance, had other ideas.

Knowing they needed at least three goals to stand any chance of progressing, Diego Simeone's side tore out of the blocks in the opening 20 minutes.

Atletico hassled and harried the visitors, creating gaps in a panicky away defence.

Real keeper Keylor Navas had already saved from Koke inside the opening five minutes before the Atletico midfielder swung in a right-wing corner which Saul met at the near post to powerfully head in.

The visitors had not conceded twice inside the opening 20 minutes of a Champions League match since 2004 - but Griezmann ended that record after Fernando Torres was bundled over by Raphael Varane's clumsy tackle.

Griezmann missed a penalty against Real in last year's Champions League final, as well as two more spot-kicks in La Liga this season, but his Paneka-style chip sneaked past the diving Navas.

La Liga leaders Real looked flustered as the noise was ramped up by the home supporters.

However, they knew one away goal would completely change the complexion of a compelling match - and Isco's opportunist strike did exactly that.

Madrid derby waves farewell to the Calderon

While the chances of Atletico thrashing their illustrious neighbours appeared slim, there was a recent precedent to which Simeone and his players looked for inspiration.

Simeone's side, then the defending La Liga champions, inflicted Real's heaviest league defeat in over four years when they produced a scintillating 4-0 home win in February 2015.

Their fans hoped they could replicate that score and provide what they thought would be a fitting farewell to the Calderon as it hosted a Champions League game for the final time.

Atletico moved into the bowl-like stadium in 1966, but will leave this summer for a state-of-the-art 76,000-seater stadium on the eastern outskirts of the Spanish capital.

The Calderon, famed for its atmosphere, was a cauldron of noise as the home supporters urged their team on to a rapid start.

For many years, the stadium hosted Atletico sides - including the one relegated in 2000 - who struggled to emerge from their shadows of their illustrious neighbours Real.

So, despite Atletico changing the dynamic in recent years under Simeone, it was perhaps quite apt their final meeting with Real there ended in pride but, ultimately, disappointment.

10,Microsoft Build 2017: the biggest highlights and news,"It’s that time of the year again, the time when Microsoft sets aside a few days to celebrate its ardent community of web developers and software engineers. While also announcing a few updates for its various services and platforms including Windows 10 , Office 365 and the Azure cloud computing platform.

The Build conference, as it’s called, took place in Seattle, Washington this year and – in an unexpected twist – the company’s day one keynote was all about the devs.

Build 2017 has been a bit of a shakeup in comparison to previous years where the first day was largely dedicated to consumer technology such as updates to Windows 10 and the Surface devices.

Given that Redmond covered much of that turf in the May 2 #MicrosoftEDU event, it makes sense to kick off Build on the more technically-focused developer side of the fence. Discussions ranged from Microsoft’s efforts in improving artificial intelligence to reflecting on its increasingly growing base of Windows 10 users.

500 million and somehow still counting

The keynote started off with a bang. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have dropped the mic when he said that Windows 10 now has 500 million monthly active devices, having grown 25% since last September when the count was 400 million. Although it’s quite the achievement, especially with Windows 10 no longer a free upgrade, it’s a far cry from the one billion Windows 10 users Microsoft hopes to reel in by 2019.

Data on data on data on data

Nadella also disclosed that commercial Office 365 now inhabits 100 million monthly active devices. Back in October of last year, Microsoft confirmed 85 million commercial users, meaning 15 million have since joined the likes of Microsoft’s cloud-based productivity suite.

That number may only increase now that Microsoft has added new functionality to Microsoft Graph , an API that grants developers access to data stemming from Office 365 services and the tools necessary to leverage that data.

Previously, Graph could only provide user and activity data, but now developers can take advantage of device data as well. Not only that, but Microsoft has also implemented a series of new core capabilities into Graph such as ‘Delta queries’ and ‘custom data’.

New Insights APIs are on the way as well, at least in their unfinished preview form, designed for developers to collect better data on how users and documents interconnect. Developers, for instance, will be able to use these APIs to gather intel on the most widely shared documents on OneDrive.

Programming made simple, now for macOS

Though it’s been in preview for quite a few months now, Visual Studio is now available to everyone with a Mac. Unlike Microsoft’s programming environment of old, Visual Studio for Mac derives heavily from the cross-platform IDE from Xamarin, which the company acquired last March.

For this reason, developers will be able to use Visual Studio for Mac to create apps for mobile, Windows and Mac directly from one Apple-branded computer.

You get an AI! You get an AI! Everyone gets an AI!

The other metrics Microsoft shared with us were of the company’s Cortana virtual assistant being being used across 141 million monthly active devices. But the bigger news here was that the company wants to go way bigger with artificial intelligence (AI) than it has already with Cortana. In fact, the company says it wants to bring AI to all of its products and services including Xbox , Windows, Bing and Office just to name a few.

Of course, making a statement this bold is easy. Proof of concept is a much tougher egg to crack. That said, Microsoft explained its ideas quite vividly.

In one example, the company showed AI protecting a workspace by verbally cautioning employees of incidents such as spills.

Alternatively, AI was used to assist workers in finding equipment and communicating more efficiently with teammates. In the future, AI could also be used to track motion for, say, virtual reality gaming and hopefully not a Kinect 3.0.

That’s not where Microsoft’s AI efforts end, however, as the company also revealed the Cortana Skills Kit which we expect to be used in conjunction with the still-unannounced Cortana Invoke speaker said to be made by Harman Kardon.

Using this kit, developers will be able to create their own skills for Cortana (currently for use on Windows 10, Android and iOS) to compete with Amazon’s Alexa. Of course, the Cortana Skills Kit will also come in handy for HP and Intel who have both signed up to create their own hardware powered by Microsoft’s virtual assistant.

A data chamber that’s out of this world

Though Azure is widely known as Microsoft’s platform for cloud computing, it’s also the name of an international database that’s an industry-first in that it exhibits “horizontal scale with guaranteed uptime, throughput, consistency and millisecond latency at the 99th percentile.”

The Azure database, according to Microsoft, was constructed from the ground up to power “planet-scale cloud services.” It even draws its data from the aforementioned Microsoft Graph. Microsoft hopes that the Azure Cosmos database will set the standard for global databases by manifesting the same version of itself everywhere simultaneously, with no regional differences hindering its functionality.

Stay tuned for what’s next at Build 2017

That about covers all of the important reveals from the first day of Microsoft Build 2017. Though today was much ado about showcasing new developer tools, tomorrow is when Microsoft is expected to debut new consumer materials. Maybe we’ll see more Windows 10 announcements or even Microsoft’s own contributions to be added to Cortana.

Who knows? We could even see an official reveal of the Harman Kardon smart speaker tech. No matter the case, you can be sure that it’s covered here on TechRadar as part of our annual coverage of the Microsoft Build conference.

Michael Parks, a veteran character actor memorable in a long career of quirky and award-winning films and TV shows, died Tuesday. He was 77.

His death in Los Angeles was confirmed by his agent, Jane Schulman of Vesta Talent Agency. She did not specify the cause of death but answered, ""Life,"" when asked why he died.

His death also was announced on social media Wednesday by Parks' Tusk and Red State director, Kevin Smith, who hailed him as his ""cinematic muse"" and ""the best actor I've ever known.""

I hate to report that my cinematic muse #michaelparks has passed away. Michael was, and will… https://t.co/55B8wFPujN — KevinSmith (@ThatKevinSmith) May 10, 2017

""I wrote both #RedState and @tuskthemovie FOR Parks,"" he wrote in an Instagram post. ""I loved his acting so much. He was, hands-down, the most incredible thespian I ever had the pleasure to watch perform. And Parks brought out the absolute best in me every time he got near my set.""

Parks also was a favorite of Quentin Tarantino, appearing in his Kill Bill films, and of Robert Rodriguez, who directed him in 1996's From Dusk to Dawn.

Parks also appeared in Ben Affleck's Oscar-winning Argo.

""He was like James Dean,"" Affleck told USA TODAY in 2012. ""He's sexy and amazing and a really good actor. I saw him in Kevin Smith's Red State as this crazy preacher."" Affleck had to trim Parks' role in the film but struggled to keep as much of his scene as possible. ""I couldn't bear to lose it.""

Parks had movie-star looks but he preferred character roles, especially villains, Schulman said. Smith said Parks ""elevated' any film or TV show he was in and any director he worked for.

""I was so ... blessed to have worked with this bonafide genius,"" he wrote. ""But really, I was just lucky to have known him at all. My heart goes out to James (Michael's son), Oriana (Michael's wife), Quentin Tarantino (Michael's biggest fan) and any movie or music lover who was ever dazzled by the talents of Michael Parks. Farewell, old friend. I'll see you farther along...""

Schulman said Parks was known as ""an actor's actor by his peers with a breadth of astonishing range that has allowed him to portray stunning contrasts — sometimes in the same film, like in 2014's Tusk, starring in dual roles as an erudite serial killer opposite Justin Long and as a feeble rube opposite Johnny Depp.""

She said he was in more than 100 films and TV shows over a 50-year career, starting as a contract player in 1961 in the ABC sitcom The Real McCoys. From 1969 to 1970 he starred as a motorcycle-riding hero in Then Came Bronson, and even sang the theme song for the show, Long Lonesome Highway, which was a hit on the Billboard and Hot Country Songs charts, she said.

His other TV series included David Lynch's Twin Peaks in the 1990s and the Dynasty spinoff The Colbys in the 1980s.

In addition to Kill Bill, Parks worked with Tarantino on 2012's Django Unchained and 2007's Death Proof. That same year, he could be seen opposite Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.

At least two of his recent films are in post-production, according to his lengthy IMDb page.

Parks was born in Corona, Calif., on April 24, 1940. According to Schulman, his pre-acting jobs included picking fruit, digging ditches, driving trucks and fighting forest fires. She noted he was a friend to such varied celebrities as Jean Renoir, Johnny Cash and Lenny Bruce, for whom he was a pallbearer.

Smith has yet to do on-field work with the team, and Jason Garrett doesn’t expect him to do much in rookie minicamp besides walkthroughs and meetings. It’s understandable for the Cowboys to take it extremely slow with their young linebacker, especially with his delicate situation.

He said he’s able to do everything in practice and is “looking tremendous,” but still wears a brace for his drop-foot condition. It remains to be seen whether he’ll need to wear it during the season, which wouldn’t be ideal, saying that will depend on the growth of the nerve.

Jerry Jones shared his thoughts on Smith’s situation Wednesday as well, saying he’ll be a “franchise player that will be around for many, many years.” That’s obviously the hope, and while doctors believe his nerve can regenerate to “maximum potential,” the Cowboys shouldn’t get too far ahead of themselves when it comes to Smith’s future.

They’re going to take it one step at a time, beginning with on-field work and training camp practices, where Jones believes he won’t have any limitations.",fox-sports
9,5 fights flying under the radar at UFC 211: Miocic vs Dos Santos 2 | FOX Sports,"Frankie Edgar vs. Yair Rodriguez

With championship fights in the main and co-main event and a welterweight No. 1 contender’s bout proceeding them, it’s hard to not to forget that UFC 211 is home to one of the best featherweight matchups of the year.

Second-ranked Frankie Edgar looks to inch closer to another shot at the 145-pound title when he battles featherweight phenom Yair Rodriguez on the UFC 211 main card. Edgar has been the model of consistency during his more than a decade-long UFC career, having lost to just three fighters total along the way.

Rodriguez is coming off a brutal win over BJ Penn and it would be very difficult not to grant him a title shot if he can get past Edgar. However, he’ll need every bit of his dynamic striking to accomplish such a feat.

Edgar vs. Rodriguez isn’t the main event, but given the history of both these fighters, it could steal the show.",fox-sports
