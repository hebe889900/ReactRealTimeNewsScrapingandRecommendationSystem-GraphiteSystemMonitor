6,Clapper: US institutions 'under assault',"Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a stern warning Sunday about the state of the US government after President Donald Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week, saying he thinks US institutions are ""under assault.""

""I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally -- and that's the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system -- and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally,"" Clapper said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Pressed by anchor Jake Tapper if he meant US institutions were under assault internally from the President, Clapper responded, ""Exactly.""

Clapper called on the other branches of the federal government to step up in their roles as a check on the executive.

""The founding fathers, in their genius, created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances,"" Clapper said. ""I feel as though that is under assault and is eroding.""

Democrats and several Republicans in Congress have publicly mulled pressing the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor or establishing an independent investigative body that could look into allegations of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in what the US intelligence community says was Moscow's efforts to influence the US election.

The Senate must confirm a new FBI director once Trump names a candidate; that FBI director will take a lead role in the Russia investigation.

Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee advocated on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Trump appoint Judge Merrick Garland to head the FBI. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said later on the program that the Republican leader had just called him to say he would support Garland for FBI's top spot.

Garland was President Barack Obama's pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia after Scalia's death last year. If appointed and confirmed as FBI director, Garland's appointment would create a vacancy on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has jurisdiction over the DC area and federal agencies, making it one of the highest legal authorities in the country short of the Supreme Court.

Can't refute or confirm collusion questions

Clapper also said Sunday that the President and the White House are wrong to cite Clapper's previous Senate testimony on the questions about alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia as proof that no such collusion exists, emphasizing that no one should portray his comments as ""exculpatory"" -- something Trump has done repeatedly on Twitter.

Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

""The bottom line is I don't know if there was collusion, political collusion,"" Clapper told Tapper. ""I don't know of any evidence to it. So I can't refute it, and I can't confirm it.""

Clapper told NBC in March that he didn't know of any evidence that demonstrated collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this month, Clapper clarified that statement, saying he was also unaware of the FBI's investigation into the matter until Comey made it public in March.

At that subcommittee hearing, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, whom Trump fired in January for refusing to defend his initial temporary ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries and suspension of the entry of Syrian refugees, declined to answer the question of whether there was evidence of collusion publicly; in her answer, she also noted that Clapper had been unaware of the FBI investigation.

Clapper said Sunday that his ""standard practice"" as the leader of the intelligence community during the Obama administration was to defer to the FBI on any counterintelligence investigations.

He noted the intelligence community's joint assessment declaring Russia had interfered in the 2016 election did not contain any reporting about political collusion.

""I did not have any evidence,"" Clapper said, again noting he was unaware of the executive branch investigation into allegations of collusion.

Comey and Trump

On Friday, Trump raised eyebrows by tweeting a warning to Comey, whom he fired unexpectedly on Tuesday, about leaking information to the media, saying he ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.""

In his news briefing later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined repeatedly to explain what the tweet meant or address questions about whether there were recording devices in the Oval Office.

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Trump and Comey had a private dinner in the White House on January 27 in which a source close to Comey said the President asked the FBI director to pledge his loyalty, which Comey, who reportedly was taken aback by the request, refused to do.

The dinner was on the same day that Yates went to the White House to warn the administration about since-ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn's potential vulnerability to Russian blackmail and that Trump issued the executive order restricting travel from several majority-Muslim nations.

Clapper said Sunday that he spoke with Comey prior to the dinner while at an event at FBI headquarters in Washington.

""He mentioned to me the invitation he had from the President for dinner,"" Clapper said. ""He was -- my characterization -- uneasy with it both from the standpoint of the optic of compromising his independence and the independence of the FBI.""",cnn

Washington (CNN) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday that the Senate should refuse to confirm a new FBI director until the Department of Justice appoints a special counsel to lead a probe into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""I think there are a lot of Democrats who feel that way,"" Schumer said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We'll have to discuss it as a caucus, but I would support that move.""

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, proposed the idea after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week.

Trump has yet to name his choice to replace Comey, for which interviews have taken place this weekend , and the Justice Department thus far has declined to appoint a special prosecutor. Republicans leading Congress have also declined to compel a special prosecutor or create an independent investigative commission.

Acknowledging Democrats' limited influence in Congress, Schumer told anchor Jake Tapper, ""The key here, of course, is getting some of our Republican colleagues to join us.""

6,Donald Trump's disastrously bad week in Washington,"Story highlights Even by Trumpian standards, the wild swings, erratic messaging and general chaos was beyond the pale

The President himself debunked the White House's explanations for why he fired Comey

Trump also sent out tweets that threatened Comey and raised the specter that he might be taping conversations

(CNN) Donald Trump's week started with Sally Yates' damning testimony about Michael Flynn and ended with a series of wild tweets and an ever-changing story about exactly why he chose to fire FBI Director James Comey.

Even by Trumpian standards, the wild swings, erratic messaging and general chaos was beyond the pale -- raising real concerns about whether Trump was losing control of the ship of state.

Start with the testimony of Yates , the one-time acting attorney general, to a Senate subcommittee Monday. She made clear that on two occasions -- once on January 26 and then again on January 27 -- she sought out White House counsel Don McGahn to warn him that national security adviser Michael Flynn had been compromised by the Russians and was a blackmail risk. Trump didn't fire Flynn until 18 days later -- a seemingly inexplicable amount of time given the allegations against him.

On Tuesday -- even as Trump's White House was trying to find an explanation for that 18-day gap -- Trump stunned the political world by firing Comey. He did so by having his former bodyguard deliver a hand-written letter -- in which Trump asserted that Comey had told him on three occasions that he wasn't under investigation(!) -- to the FBI. Comey was in Los Angeles at the time, finding out of his firing the way the rest of us did: on TV.

Trump's White House was entirely unprepared for the firestorm that erupted -- likely because they, like the rest of us, had no idea it was coming. The initial spin offered by the White House, from Vice President Mike Pence on down, was that Trump had acted ""decisively"" after reading a memo from deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that hammered Comey for his conduct in the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.

16,"Ransomware: Attack hits 150 countries, Europol says world is in 'disaster recovery mode'","The biggest cyberattack the world has ever seen is still claiming victims and threatens to create even more havoc on Monday when people return to work.

The attack is a virus that locks people out of their computer files until they pay a ransom to the hackers.

Experts say the spread of the virus had been stymied by a security researcher in the U.K. Hackers have issued new versions of the virus that cyber security organizations are actively trying to counter and stamp out.

""We will get a decryption tool eventually, but for the moment, it's still a live threat and we're still in disaster recovery mode,"" Rob Wainwright, the head of the European Union's law enforcement agency Europol, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Sunday. He added that the agency is still analyzing the virus and has yet to identify who is responsible for the attack.

The U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre said Sunday that there have been ""no sustained new attacks"" of the kind that struck Friday.

But the agency added that some infections may not yet have been detected, and that existing infections can spread within networks.

Wainwright said earlier on British TV that the attack was ""unprecedented"" in its reach, with more than 200,000 victims in at least 150 countries.

Organizations around the world spent the weekend trying to recover after being hit by a virus that seeks to seize control of computers until victims pay a ransom.

Hospitals, major companies and government offices were among those that were badly affected. Cybersecurity experts have said the majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan. But U.K. hospitals, Chinese universities and global firms like Fedex (FDX) also reported they had come under assault.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, at a meeting in Italy, said Saturday the attack was a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. ""It's a big priority of mine that we protect the financial infrastructure,"" he said.

Europol's Wainwright underscored the point Sunday. All sectors of the economy were vulnerable and organizations could take lessons from the banking industry, which appeared to have largely escaped the global attack.

""Very few banks if any have been affected because they've learned from painful experience of being the number one target for cybercrime,"" he said on ITV's Peston on Sunday program.

The ransomware, called WannaCry, locks down files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of NSA spy tools.

Related: How to protect yourself from the ransomware attack

The ransomware is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that hadn't updated their systems were still at risk.

In the wake of the attack, Microsoft said it had taken the ""highly unusual step"" of releasing a patch for computers running older operating systems including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003.

The patches won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

Experts said Sunday it appeared that the ransomware had made just over $32,000, although they expected that number to pop when people went back into the office Monday.

Security agencies have so far not been able to identify who was behind the attack. Wainwright said Europol did not know the motive. He added that ransomware attacks were normally criminal rather than political in nature. ""Remarkably few payments"" had so far been made in response to this attack, he added.

Related: 5 things to know about the attack

WannaCry has already caused massive disruption around the globe.

Sixteen National Health Service organizations in the U.K. were hit, and some of those hospitals canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible.

Barts Health, which runs five hospitals in London, said Sunday it was still experiencing disruption to its computer systems and it asked for the public to use other NHS services wherever possible.

In China, the internet security company Qihoo360 issued a ""red alert"" saying that a large number of colleges and students in the country had been affected by the ransomware, which is also referred to as WannaCrypt. State media reported that digital payment systems at some gas stations were offline, forcing customers to pay cash.

Related: NSA's powerful Windows hacking tools leaked online

Major global companies said they also came under attack. Fedex said Friday it was ""experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware."" Two big telecom companies, Telefónica (TEF) of Spain and Megafon of Russia, were also hit, as was Japanese carmaker Nissan (NSANF) in the U.K.

Russia's Interior Ministry acknowledged a ransomware attack on its computers. It said less than 1% of computers were affected, and that the virus was now ""localized"" and being destroyed.

U.K. defense secretary Michael Fallon said Sunday that Britain's nuclear submarines were safe from cyberattack.

Related: How leaked NSA spy tools created a hacking free-for-all

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, the attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion.

When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.

16,Global cyberattack: A super-simple explanation of what happened,"Meet WannaCry. Security wonks are calling it the biggest cyberattack ever.

What the attack does

Cyber bad guys have spread ransomware, known as WannaCry, to computers around the world. It locks down all the files on an infected computer. The hackers then demand $300 in order to release control of the files. That's why it's called ransomware.

How it happened

WannaCry takes advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.

The software tools to create the attack were revealed in April among a trove of NSA spy tools that were either leaked or stolen. The tools were made public by a hacking group called the Shadow Brokers.

Microsoft released a security patch for the vulnerabilities in March. But many corporations don't automatically update their systems, because Windows updates can screw up their legacy software programs.

The phenomenon of companies failing to update their systems has been a persistent security problem for years. Playing with fire finally caught up with the victims.

Consumers are also at risk. Microsoft requires Windows 10 customers to automatically update their computers, but some people with older PCs disabled automatic updates.

How widespread is the damage

The attack has been found in 150 countries, affecting 200,000 computers, according to Europol, the European law enforcement agency. FedEx, Nissan, and the United Kingdom's National Health Service were among the victims.

In the U.K., hospitals were crippled by the cyberattack, which forced operations to be canceled and ambulances to be diverted.

Also hit were Deutsche Bahn, the Russian Central Bank, Russian Railways, Russia's Interior Ministry, Megafon and Telefónica.

Who is vulnerable

Anyone who hasn't updated their Windows PC recently.

Microsoft said it had taken the ""highly unusual step"" of releasing a patch for computers running older operating systems including Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. So even people with older computers should go update them.

Apple's Mac computers were not targeted by this ransomware attack so are clear. Bad guys generally target Windows far more than Apple's operating system because there are vastly more computers running Windows around the world.

How to prevent being attacked

According to security company Bitdefender, follow these five steps:

1. Disable your computer's Server Message Block service.

2. Install Microsoft's patch.

3. Back up your data on an offline hard drive.

4. Install all Windows updates.

5. Use a reputable security software to prevent attacks in the future.

Who is behind the attack

The hackers remain anonymous for now, but it appears that they are amateurs. A 22-year old security researcher in the U.K. discovered a ""kill-switch"" to initially stop the spread of the attack. The ease of stopping the attack suggests the hackers were new to this game.

Experts said it appeared that the ransomware had made just over $32,000, although they expected that number to pop when people went back into the office Monday.

What happens next

Computers and networks that hadn't recently updated their systems are still at risk because the ransomware is lurking. And WannaCry threatens to create even more havoc on Monday when people return to work.

Experts say the spread of the virus had been stymied by a security researcher in the U.K. hackers have issued new versions of the virus that cyber security organizations are actively trying to counter and stamp out.

The U.K. government's cyber office put it succinctly: ""[T]he way these attacks work means that compromises of machines and networks that have already occurred may not yet have been detected, and that existing infections from the malware can spread within networks.""",cnn
10,Ransomware cyber-attack threat escalating - Europol,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How to protect yourself online

Friday's cyber-attack has affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries, Europol chief Rob Wainwright says.

He told the BBC the act was ""unprecedented in its scale"" and warned more people could find themselves affected on Monday morning.

The virus took control of users' files, demanding payments; Russia and the UK were among the worst-hit countries.

Experts say another attack could be imminent and have warned people to ensure their security is up to date.

Mr Wainwright said that the ransomware - software that blocks access to data until a ransom is paid - was combined with a worm application - a program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.

This, he said, was allowing the ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"".

He added: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.""

'Patch before Monday'

Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the ransomware, he said.

Companies need to make sure they have updated their systems and ""patched where they should"" before staff arrived for work on Monday morning, the EU law enforcement agency head said.

In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, GP surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.

What occurred was an ""indiscriminate attack across the world on multiple industries and services"", Mr Wainwright said, including Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry.

However, he said that so far ""remarkably"" few payments had been made by victims of the attack.

BBC analysis of three accounts linked with the global attack suggests the hackers have been paid the equivalent of £22,080.

The Europol chief said his agency was working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to find those responsible, and that more than one person was likely to be involved.

The virus exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software, first identified by the US National Security Agency, experts have said.

After taking computers over, it displayed messages demanding a payment of $300 (£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock files and return them to the user.

Microsoft released security updates last month to address the vulnerability, with another patch released on Friday.

The UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".

MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.

Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) have unseated the Social Democrats in a key state election, exit polls say.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU is projected to win 34.5% of votes in North Rhine-Westphalia, compared with 30.5% for the Social Democrats (SPD).

It was seen as a test for Mrs Merkel ahead of September's general election.

The SPD has run the state - Germany's most populous - for most of the post-war period. Party leader Martin Schulz said it was a ""hard day"".

Voters were choosing candidates for the state legislature, whose leadership may now change from its current SPD-Green coalition.

The SPD's vote is said to be down by 8.6 percentage points on the last election there in 2012, while the CDU vote is up by almost the same amount.

Mr Schulz had predicted a victory there would make him the next German chancellor - but the victory for Mrs Merkel's party will now give her a boost as she seeks a fourth term.

The first exit polls also predict 12% for the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP); 6% for the Greens; 7.5% for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD); and 5% for The Left.

Schulz loses his shine - Damian McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin

""This is a hard day for social democracy,"" said Martin Schulz, visibly shaken. It is also difficult day for him personally. North Rhine-Westphalia is his home state and traditionally an SPD stronghold.

So although the concrete issues that shaped this election were primarily regional - such as schools, transport and security - this state also matters nationally. It is seen as a bellwether for national elections.

There was a boost in his poll ratings and a surge of excitement when Mr Schulz announced earlier this year that he would challenge Mrs Merkel - it became known as the ""Schulz effect"".

His plan was to win over voters with a down-to-earth approach. But policy proposals have remained vague, and critics say the folksy charm has started to wear thin.

Now that his party has lost three regional elections in a row, the polls are down and the Schulz effect may have vanished as quickly as it came.

Image copyright AFP

The result could also mean the worst election result for the SPD since 1947, Die Welt newspaper reports.

Polls before the vote had suggested the CDU and SDP were neck-and-neck.

But the CDU's campaign - which targeted voters' frustration on issues such as traffic congestion, rising crime and education - appears to have swayed voters.

9,Lewis Hamilton wins spectacular Spanish Grand Prix,"Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes stole a stunning victory in the Spanish Grand Prix from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.

A clever strategic move by the team followed by Hamilton attacking and passing Vettel put the Briton in control and he defended successfully to the end.

Vettel had passed Hamilton off the start line to lead for the first half of the race but ended up out-flanked by their rivals.

Hamilton's second win of the season cut his deficit to Vettel in the championship to six points after five of 20 races.

There was plenty of incident on the first lap, leading to Raikkonen and Verstappen colliding and both retiring

Why was it such a great race?

It was a tense and gripping battle befitting the closeness of the fight between Formula 1's top teams this season.

Vettel took control of the race with a superb start, sweeping around the outside of Hamilton into Turn One and building a 2.2-second lead with a blistering first lap.

When Ferrari beat Mercedes to making the first pit stop, preventing Hamilton passing by stopping earlier and benefiting from fresh tyres, the race appeared to be Vettel's to lose and Mercedes to win.

Mercedes switched strategies, putting Hamilton on a long middle stint on the slower medium tyre, the idea being to attack Vettel at the end of the race, when Hamilton would be on the soft tyre and the Ferrari on the medium.

They then bought themselves some time by delaying the first pit stop of Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas so he could hold up Vettel for a couple of laps.

Who has won what in the 2017 season so far. Next stop: Monaco

Vettel's amazing double dummy overtake

Vettel's delay behind Bottas brought Hamilton's deficit to the Ferrari down by four seconds but the German limited the damage with a stunning passing move on the Finn into Turn One.

Vettel dummied to the inside, then the outside, before diving down the inside, his wheels brushing the grass, to grasp the lead and apparently take another step towards victory.

What went on in Spain...

Vettel's aggressive defensive move

The race turned during a period of the virtual safety car, when cars are forced to lap at controlled speeds while a car is cleared from a dangerous spot.

This was to remove Stoffel Vandoorne's McLaren, which went off at the first corner after a collision with Massa.

The VSC was in play for two laps and Mercedes waited until it was just about to end to pit Hamilton for a set of soft tyres.

The move was an inspired gamble with 30 laps still to go, a tough task on the soft tyre.

Ferrari responded to Mercedes by stopping Vettel for the final time a lap later and he rejoined from the pits as Hamilton pounded down the pit straight.

They went into the first corner side by side and Vettel forced Hamilton off the track at Turn One as he defended his lead.

Vettel pushed Hamilton off track as he came out of the pits. A move Hamilton knows plenty about himself...

Hamilton's amazing overtake

Hamilton now had to pass Vettel on a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult.

He pressured Vettel hard for the next seven laps before getting close enough to try for a pass at the start of lap 44. Hamilton was close enough at the final corner to get the DRS overtaking aid and he swept by Vettel around the outside into Turn One.

Hamilton, who sounded breathless and anxious on the radio throughout the race, tensely asked his team what he needed to do in terms of building a gap while also protecting his tyres, and Ferrari briefly considered switching strategy to make an extra stop.

But he controlled his pace exquisitely to take his 55th win and almost certainly one of his best.

That's Hamilton's second Spanish GP win, equal with Ayrton Senna, above pipping Nigel Mansell to the 1986 win by a millisecond. Source: Forix

Minnows pick up vital points

After helping Hamilton out, Bottas looked set for third place but he broke down with an engine failure on lap 39.

His retirement handed third place to Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, a huge 73 seconds behind Hamilton and Vettel.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen retired on the first lap after a collision at the first corner as they went three-abreast with Bottas.

Force India took fourth and fifth with Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon, with Renault's Nico Hulkenberg seventh.

What happened to Alonso?

Meat and greet: Alonso walks over to the fans before the race - inexplicably carrying a leg of ham

Fernando Alonso had a dispiriting day 24 hours after thrilling his home fans and impressing the paddock with a stunning seventh place on the grid.

The McLaren driver dropped to 10th on the first lap when he was forced wide and off the track at the second corner by Williams' Felipe Massa and had to drive through the gravel to rejoin.

Alonso will fly overnight to America to start his assault on the Indianapolis 500, for which he is missing the next race in Monaco, where Jenson Button will come out of retirement to substitute for him.

Driver of the day

Vettel did little wrong - and his race included that superb pass on Bottas - but it's hard to look past Hamilton. After the decisive strategy move, he did the right thing in avoiding a collision with Vettel as the Ferrari came out of the pits and he tracked Vettel superbly and pulled off his own great pass to take one of his greatest wins.

What happens next?

Monaco, in two week's time. It's impossible to predict what will happen on the claustrophobic streets of Monaco in this see-saw battle between Mercedes and Ferrari.

Hamilton said earlier in the year he thought the shorter Ferrari might be more agile there, but the Mercedes was the fastest car through the tight final sector of Barcelona's lap so another close battle is almost certainly in store.

6,Sturgeon says 'we need to do better' on education,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption People in Scotland shouldn't have to ""like it or lump it"" with any Brexit deal, says Nicola Sturgeon

The curriculum followed by Scotland's schools needs to focus more on literacy and numeracy, Nicola Sturgeon has said.

Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, the Scottish first minister admitted ""we need to do better"" after figures showed less than half of 13 and 14-year-olds were performing well in writing.

Ms Sturgeon also said that Scotland may need a ""phased"" approach to European Union (EU) membership if independent.

She also ruled out the country adopting the Euro.

During her interview, Ms Sturgeon said that Scottish ministers had ""taken advice"" on refocusing the country's education policy, the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE).

CfE was implemented in Scottish schools in 2010.

The latest Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy figures followed another set of poor results for Scottish pupils, when the international Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) found scores for maths, reading and science had all declined.

Ms Sturgeon insisted she was not denying the results and said measures were being taken to address the issues.

'Certain recommendations'

She told the programme: ""I've been very open that this is not good enough.

She said that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had been communicating with her government to address concerns.

Ms Sturgeon said: ""They've made certain recommendations to us about how we improve the teaching of literacy and numeracy.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The latest Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy found less than half of 13 and 14-year-old were performing well at writing

""Right now we've got a new national improvement framework, we have an attainment challenge, we have an attainment fund putting significant extra resources into education.""

She added: ""But we have had some advice that we need to have more of a focus in our curriculum on literacy and numeracy and that's exactly what we're doing right now, so we've introduced new benchmarks for the teaching of literacy and numeracy.""

'Supposed top priority'

Ms Sturgeon also said that her government was increasing the budget of head teachers in Scotland by £120m to invest in measures it believes would improve levels of literacy and numeracy.

Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith criticised the Scottish government's record on education and said it was an admission of failure.

She said ""After ten years of SNP control over Scottish education, it is simply not good enough for Nicola Sturgeon to say that improvements will be made by 2021.

""Scottish children cannot afford to wait until the next parliament for things to get better.

""It is time for the SNP to put its obsession with independence to one side and get on with tackling its supposed top priority of improving education.""

The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, called it a ""bruising interview"" for Ms Sturgeon and said she had been faced with the reality of her ""own appalling record on education"".

EU membership 'phased'

On Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon told Andrew Marr that ""by necessity"" Scotland might have to pursue membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) before achieving full EU membership.

The SNP leader said her position remained that she wanted an independent Scotland to be in the EU.

""If Scotland is independent, our position always has been, as long as I've been in the SNP and continues to be, that we want Scotland to be a full member of the European Union,"" she said.

""We don't want to go into the Euro and no member of the EU can be forced into the Euro and Sweden is one of the examples of that.""

""Now we have to set out, if we're in an independence referendum - and we're not in that right now - the process for regaining or retaining, depending on where we are in the Brexit process, EU membership.

""Now it may be that we have a phased approach to that by necessity.""

Asked whether that could mean Efta membership first and EU membership later, she said: ""It may be by necessity, even if we didn't want that.""

It is supposed to be the Brexit election.

Yet in Scotland, on the campaign trail, you're more likely to hear talk of independence.

Of the four parties in Scotland defending seats at Westminster, the one least likely to major on independence in this campaign is the SNP, even though it exists to achieve independence.

There's an obvious reason for that. Independence divides opinion and in any election the SNP wants to broaden its appeal beyond ""Yes"" voters.

This has worked successfully for the party in the past.

In 2015, the SNP positioned itself as the party best placed to ""stand up for Scotland's best interests"" at Westminster.

It secured its best ever election result, winning 50% of the vote, 5% above the level of support for independence in the 2014 referendum.

In this year's election, Nicola Sturgeon has also sought to redefine the mandate that she is seeking in this UK general election.

It is, she said, ""to demand a place for Scotland at the Brexit negotiating table and the inclusion of the case for our place in the single market in the negotiating remit"".

That is a ""more immediate priority"" than indyref2, Ms Sturgeon said.

Read Glenn Campbell's full article here.

Jackson Carlaw, Scottish Conservative deputy leader, responded to Ms Sturgeon's words by describing her position on Europe as ""complete chaos"".

He said: ""She claims we must have a referendum on independence because we're leaving the EU.

""Now, in a cynical attempt to win back Leave voters who have deserted the SNP, she now refuses to say whether an independent Scotland would go back in.

""And her flirtation with EFTA would leave us with all the obligations but no voice in decision-making.""

Labour's Kezia Dugdale said: ""The reality is the Nationalists have quietly shifted away from a policy of immediate EU membership if Scotland leaves the UK.

""Nicola Sturgeon claims Scotland must leave the UK because of Brexit, but won't even commit to rejoining the EU straight away.""

The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, accused Nicola Sturgeon of ""selling out pro Europeans"" to win back Brexit supporters.

He added: ""The SNP are using the EU as their excuse to call another independence vote but won't guarantee Scotland in the EU will be a result of their vote.

""For the SNP it is always about independence. The EU and a vote on the terms of Brexit are the latest excuses.""",bbc-news
3,Emmanuel Macron inauguration: French president vows new start,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""Divisions have to be overcome"" - newly-elected President Emmanuel Macron

Emmanuel Macron has promised to restore France's global standing, as he was inaugurated as the country's youngest president at the age of 39.

At an elaborate ceremony at the Élysée Palace in Paris, he said his presidency would ""give the French back the confidence to believe in themselves"".

He vowed to see the EU ""reformed and relaunched"" during his time in office.

He takes over from François Hollande, whose five-year term was plagued by high unemployment figures.

Mr Macron was proclaimed France's new president a week after his resounding victory over the National Front's Marine le Pen, with 66% of the vote in the run-off poll.

The former investment banker, who had never contested an election before and only formed his centrist movement a year ago, has vowed to shake up the country's political order and reinvigorate its economy.

Tight security was in place across Paris for the ceremony at the president's official residence, with hundreds of extra police on patrol.

France has been under a state of emergency since terror attacks in 2015 and a large section of the city centre was closed to traffic all morning.

'World needs France'

During his inaugural address on Sunday, President Macron pledged to restore the confidence of the French people in their country's future.

""The division and fractures in our society must be overcome,"" said the centrist politician.

""The world and Europe need more than ever France, and a strong France, which speaks out loudly for freedom and solidarity,"" he declared.

He said he would convince the people that ""the power of France is not declining - that we are on the brink of a great renaissance"".

He was presented with a necklace once worn by Napoleon I, as a symbol of his position as Grand Master of the Legion of Honour (a title usually given to the leader of France).

Before the ceremony began, he spent nearly an hour with his predecessor, who handed him the country's nuclear codes. It was Mr Hollande who launched the new president's political career, appointing him first as adviser and later economy minister.

Despite historic low approval ratings, the former president tweeted after leaving the palace: ""I leave a country in a much better state than I found it.""

The sunshine president - by Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris

It was interesting to note how many ""re-"" words Emmanuel Macron used in his address. There was ""re-formulate"", ""re-invent"", ""re-mould"", ""re-juvenate"", ""re-launch"". And of course ""re-naissance"".

It was all intended to ""re""-inforce the message that this presidency will be one of newness, youth and optimism.

Mr Macron is one of nature's optimists. Francois Hollande - the man from whose hands he took the reins of power - said that when Mr Macron worked for him, he ""radiated joy"". An almost preternaturally sunny demeanour, combined with his winning way with words, has been the new president's magic formula.

But to hold presidential office is to walk a road of thorns. Rarely is there good news to smile at. Success - if it comes at all - may only be appreciated years later. Mr Macron's ""re-splendent"" personality is about to tested like never before.

At 39, Mr Macron is France's youngest leader since Napoleon and the first to be born after 1958, when a presidential system was set up.

His En Marche political movement was formed just last year and as a new party - La République En Marche - will be fielding candidates across France in June's parliamentary elections.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Twenty-one cannon blasts were heard across Paris as a formal salute for the new leader

He has promised to ""work for everyone"" and sees his programme as straddling both left and right.

Mr Macron's first week in office will be busy. He heads for Berlin on Monday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and to demonstrate his commitment to the European Union.

He is also expected to name a prime minister on Monday morning.

Mr Macron faces major challenges including high unemployment, especially among France's young, and low growth.

He says his main aims are to boost investment and to set up a ""new growth model"" that increases social mobility and helps the environment.

Later on Sunday, Mr Macron visited the Arc de Triomphe and laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier.",bbc-news
3,North Korea missile test 'due to Kim Jong-un paranoia',"Image copyright STR/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Launching missiles is not the way to get into talks with Washington, the US says

The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has accused North Korean leader Kim Jong-un of being in a ""state of paranoia"", following another ballistic missile test.

The test was a message to the South days after a new president took office, she told ABC News.

The US would continue to ""tighten the screws"" on North Korea, Ms Haley said.

Japanese officials say the missile, which launched from north-western Kusong, reached an altitude of 2,000km.

South Korea's newly elected President Moon Jae-in, who is seeking deeper engagement with the North, said it was a ""reckless provocation"".

US President Donald Trump has called for ""stronger sanctions"" against North Korea, while China is urging restraint.

'No meeting'

A series of North Korean missile tests this year - which are banned by the UN - has sparked international alarm and raised tensions with the US.

Two missile launches last month both failed, with the rockets exploding just minutes into flight.

North Korea recently said it would hold talks with the US ""if the conditions were right"", after President Trump said he would be ""honoured"" to meet Kim Jong-un under the right circumstances.

But Ms Haley said launching missiles was not the way to get a meeting. ""Until he meets our conditions, we're not sitting down with him,"" she said.

Stephen Evans: Is Kim Jong-un rational?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""Is he sane? I have no idea,"" Mr Trump said in a recent CBS interview

Is it a new type of missile?

The nature of the launch is still being determined, but analysts have said the test could suggest a longer range than previously tested devices.

The Japanese defence minister said it flew for about 30 minutes before falling in the Sea of Japan and could be a new type of missile.

Tomomi Inada said it covered a distance of about 700km (435 miles), reaching an altitude of more than 2,000km (1,245 miles) - higher than that reached by an intermediate-range missile North Korea fired in February.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs] can potentially reach altitudes of hundreds of kilometres, taking them well outside the Earth's atmosphere.

Experts quoted by Reuters say the altitude meant the missile was launched at a high trajectory, limiting the lateral distance it travelled. They say if it had been fired at a standard trajectory, it would have had a range of at least 4,000km.

The US Pacific Command said in a statement the type was being assessed but that its flight was not consistent with that of an ICBM, which would have the range to reach the US mainland (more than 6,000km).

North Korea is believed to be developing two types of ICBM, but neither has so far been flight tested.

How close to an ICBM? By BBC Korea correspondent Stephen Evans

If the Japanese analysis of the trajectory is right (that the missile reached an altitude of 2,000km), North Korea appears to have advanced its technology markedly.

The previous two tests failed, so reliability is not there yet. But last month some experts reckoned that a seemingly new missile on parade in Pyongyang may have been an ICBM (the type President Trump said ""won't happen"").

Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California thought at the time that the new missiles on show might be ICBMs. Is this that missile?

One thing is certain: North Korea will certainly trumpet its success if it does now have the capability to strike the US military bases on Guam, 3,400km from Pyongyang in the Western Pacific. Mr Trump would ponder what to do with even greater urgency.

How have others reacted?

Mr Moon hosted an emergency meeting of his security council in the wake of the launch.

""The president said while South Korea remains open to the possibility of dialogue with North Korea, it is only possible when the North shows a change in attitude,"" his spokesman said.

Meanwhile, a member of South Korea's ruling party attending a major summit in China reportedly told the North Korean delegation directly that they ""strongly condemned"" the launch.

Image copyright EPA Image caption South Koreans will be watching closely to see how their new leader responds to the test

The White House said President Donald Trump ""cannot imagine Russia is pleased"" because the missile did not land far from Russian territory.

A Kremlin spokesperson later said Russian President Vladimir Putin was concerned by the test.

China, North Korea's only major ally, called for restraint by ""all relevant parties"" in the wake of the latest test.

How are US-North Korea relations?

The North has conducted five nuclear tests despite UN sanctions and is also developing long-range missiles.

It is reported to be continuing efforts to miniaturise nuclear warheads and fit them on missiles capable of reaching the US.

Washington has accused other UN Security Council members of not fully enforcing existing sanctions against the North, and has urged China in particular to use its trade links as influence.",bbc-news

WASHINGTON — Pvt. Chelsea Manning, the transgender soldier and convicted national security secret leaker, will remain an active-duty, unpaid soldier, eligible for health care and other benefits, following her scheduled release May 17 from military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, according to the Army.

Manning entered prison as a man named Bradley. Manning changed her name, identified as a woman and received hormone treatment while incarcerated. Her sentence was commuted in the final days of the Obama administration, a move that infuriated some in the military and President Trump.

While Manning’s court-martial conviction remains under appeal, she will remain a private in the Army, said Dave Foster, an Army spokesman. As an active duty soldier, Manning will continue to receive health care and have access to commissaries and military exchanges, but she will not be paid.

“Pvt. Manning is statutorily entitled to medical care while on excess leave in an active duty status, pending final appellate review,” Foster said.

The Army refused to disclose the other terms of Manning’s release, six years before her eligibility for parole, citing privacy concerns. She had been sentenced to 35 years for releasing hundreds of thousands of secret documents to WikiLeaks. Manning appeared at court martial in the uniform of an enlisted man.

Like all soldiers, Manning will be assigned to an Army post but it is unclear where and to whom she will report.

The ACLU released a statement on Manning’s behalf on May 9. “For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,” Manning said. “I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world.

Claims of abuse

Her lawyer, Chase Strangio, added in the ACLU statement that Manning had been abused at Leavenworth but did not specify the type of abuse.

“Like far too many people in prison, particularly transgender women, Chelsea Manning has had to survive unthinkable violence throughout the seven years of her incarceration,” Manning said.

Trump, in his first days in office, blasted Obama’s decision to release Manning from prison early, and Manning for criticizing the former president. Manning had written a column, saying Obama had failed to live up to his promises.

“Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible” Trump tweeted.

While in prison Manning had received hormone treatment and care for gender dysphoria. She had also been informed that she was eligible for sex reassignment surgery to be paid for by the government. However, if the appeal of her conviction is denied, she could be dishonorably discharged, which mandates a loss of benefits including health care.

Manning’s fight for treatment in military prison made her a cause celebre among transgender advocates. She announced the change in her name and announced, “I am a female,” in a statement read on her behalf in 2013 on national television

Efforts to boost transgender rights culminated last summer in the Pentagon’s decision to rescind the ban on service for troops who identified as the opposite gender. In the months that followed, more than 100 troops came forward requesting treatment for gender dysphoria. Estimates show there are as many as 6,000 transgender troops among the 1.3 million active-duty service members.

Manning, who has a Twitter account managed by her supporters, said she was looking forward to her release. “Celebrating a new hope, and a return of the sun.”

6,James Clapper: U.S. institutions 'under assault'  by President Trump,"Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)

WASHINGTON — James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, said Sunday that U.S. institutions are ""under assault"" by President Trump as evidenced by Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey last week.

Clapper said on CNN's State of the Union that ""the developments of the past week are very bothersome, very disturbing to me."" Trump fired Comey in the midst of the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government in last year's presidential election.

""I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally — and that's the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system — and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally,"" Clapper said.

When CNN host Jake Tapper asked if he meant they were under assault by the president, Clapper responded: ""Exactly.""

""The founding fathers in their genius created a system of co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances, and I feel as though that is under assault and is eroding,"" Clapper said.

He said he hopes senators and members of Congress from both parties will examine their consciences and decide how to respond to what the White House is doing. ""I hope they'll speak up,"" Clapper said, referring to Republicans.

In a separate appearance on ABC's This Week, Clapper said Comey's firing is a victory for Russia.

""What's unfolded now, here, the lead of the investigation about potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has been removed,"" Clapper said. ""So the Russians have to consider this as...another victory on the scoreboard for them.""

The former national intelligence director for the Obama administration also said on CNN that his past statements that he didn't know of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year's presidential election ""should not be considered exculpatory"" even though they have been used that way by Trump.

Clapper said the report from the intelligence community that he was citing when he made those statements to Congress early this year focused on whether the Russians tried to interfere in the U.S. election. The report concluded that they did, but it did not address possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russian officials.

Trump has cited Clapper's past statements as evidence that his campaign did not collude with the Russians. The president has denounced any suggestion of collusion as a ""witch hunt"" by Democrats who are still upset over losing the White House.

Clapper said he deferred to the FBI director about whether and when to tell him about any counter-intelligence investigations he might be conducting, including any involving Russia and the Trump campaign. He said he didn't know for sure that the FBI was investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials until Comey testified about it in March before congressional committees. Clapper had left office by then.

""The bottom line is I don't know if there was collusion, political collusion,"" Clapper said ""I don't know of any evidence to it. So I can't refute it, and I can't confirm it.""

Clapper said Comey's firing ""came as a great shock and was very disturbing to FBI employees.""

""It's very disturbing to me the negative morale impact this event has had,"" he said.

Although people took issue with some of Comey's decisions, he was well-respected in the intelligence community, Clapper said. ""As far as his stature as a leader and his integrity, people are very upset about the way he was treated,"" he said.

Turning to who might replace Comey, Josh Holmes, former chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Fox News Sunday that he spoke with McConnell on Sunday. Holmes said McConnell could support federal Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to lead the FBI. The idea was floated last week by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.

Former president Barack Obama nominated Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. Republican senators refused to consider Garland. Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was confirmed to fill the slot instead.

""I think the Senate majority leader thinks that's a fantastic idea,"" Holmes said, referring to Garland as a possible FBI director. ""It's somebody who obviously Democrats have significant trust and respect for, they've articulated that over the last year, and someone who can do the job impartially and I think he (McConnell) is going to be prepared to make that suggestion.""

NBC has big plans in store for this season's breakout drama hit This Is Us. Not only has the series been renewed for two more seasons, but the network is shifting it to a key 9 p.m. ET/PT slot on Thursday night and will air it following the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.

The moves are part of a new schedule that will add five dramas and three new comedies, but as with last year, only three fall newcomers: A 12-episode revival of former hit comedy Will & Grace, also on Thursdays; The Brave, a drama about undercover military heroes starring Mike Vogel as a special-ops agent and Anne Heche as a deputy CIA director, which gets the post-Voice slot on Mondays; and Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, tracking the true story of Los Angeles brothers who killed their parents. Set to follow Will & Grace, Great News and Us on Thursdays, it's part of what NBC Entertainment chief Robert Greenblatt on Sunday called an attempted ""return of must-see TV"" that night as a promotional hook.

NBC also renewed a remake of feature film Taken, moving to Fridays, and first-year comedies The Good Place and Great News (producer Tina Fey will appear in the newsroom comedy next season). Also back: Timeless, a time-travel fantasy (and the top pick in USA TODAY's Save Our Shows poll), that could return as early as next spring. After canceling the show Thursday, in a rare reversal the network changed its mind on Saturday, thanks to some lobbying by producers.

Cancellations included Grimm, spring comedy Powerless, limited series Emerald City and short-lived spinoff The Blacklist: Redemption. But NBC says there's a chance that comedy Trial & Error and Chicago Justice, the fourth and newest in Dick Wolf's Windy City franchise, could return later. Among other schedule changes, The Blacklist will shift to Wednesdays and Blindspot also will move to Fridays.

For the season (which ends May 24), NBC has held steady, averaging 8.2 million viewers, ranking second behind CBS, and is first among adults ages 18 to 49, its core demographic, where it's down a slight 1% from last year.

NBC's fall schedule (new shows in bold, new time slots in italics; all times ET/PT):

Monday: 8, The Voice; 10, The Brave.

Tuesday: 8, The Voice; 9, Superstore; 9:30, The Good Place; 10, Chicago Fire.

Wednesday: 8, The Blacklist; 9, Law & Order: SVU; 10, Chicago PD

Thursday: 8, Will & Grace; 8:30, Great News; 9, This is Us; 10, Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Brothers

Friday: 8, Blindspot; 9, Taken; 10, Dateline NBC.

Saturday: 8, Drama repeats; 10, Saturday Night Live repeats.

6,Analysis: Donald Trump has biggest credibility gap of any president since Nixon,"President Donald Trump arrives for Liberty University's commencement Saturday in Lynchburg, Virginia. (Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)

President Trump drew the biggest Inaugural crowd in history — except he didn’t. President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign — except there’s no evidence that he did. Trump fired FBI director James Comey because the deputy attorney general concluded he had mishandled the Hillary Clinton email investigation — except now the president says it was his decision alone and cites the Russia investigation as the reason.

On issues big and small, substantive and cosmetic, the Trump White House has failed to give accurate accounts of what happened until photographs, records, reporting and, in some cases, the president's own words provide a new version of the facts. Even when confronted with evidence, the president and his spokespeople don’t always acknowledge the need to correct a falsehood.

This doesn’t seem to bother Trump.

“It is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!” he tweeted Friday with apparent good cheer, then mused about canceling the daily press briefing. Later, press secretary Sean Spicer didn't make it clear whether the president was serious or joking about upending a fixture of White House operations since the Harding administration, and he wouldn't expand on a separate tweet from Trump suggesting that he might have recorded his conversation with Comey.

Concerned or not, Trump now faces the biggest credibility gap of any president since at least Richard Nixon during Watergate (a scandal that forced his resignation) or Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War (a spiraling controversy that prompted him not to seek a second full term). For LBJ, it was the disparity between the official version of the war's course and the reporting from the front lines that added the phrase “credibility gap” to the political lexicon.

""I wrote a book about what goes into making great presidential leadership, and one of the elements I said was credibility, was trust,"" said presidential historian Robert Dallek, author of Hail to the Chief: The Making and Unmaking of American Presidents as well as biographies of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Nixon and Johnson. ""When presidents lose the trust of the public, I think it's very difficult if not impossible for them to govern this country.""

On Trump, Dallek warned, ""His credibility is very shaky.""

Read more:

The current controversies have taken a toll on Americans' views of Trump. In a Quinnipiac Poll this month, those surveyed said by 61%-33% that Trump wasn't honest. That is a 28-percentage-point underwater rating on honesty, double the 14-point divide he scored in the same survey at the beginning of the year.

The poll was taken before the latest and most spectacular example: The decision to fire Comey. At the White House Tuesday night, Spicer said the decision had been made by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had criticized Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails; Trump had accepted Rosenstein's recommendation. Vice President Mike Pence repeated that explanation to reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

But on Thursday, Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he had decided to fire Comey regardless of what Rosenstein recommended, and he cited a different reason. ""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.""

Trump's decision to dismiss the FBI director has rattled official Washington, stoked what Democrats already call the ""Resistance,"" and fueled reporting that the president is about to shake up his senior White House staff — though the fiercest controversies have centered on the president's statements, not those of his aides. Questions about whether Trump will stand by his word imperil the administration's efforts to negotiate a health-care compromise and a major tax package with members of Congress. And it casts a cloud over his first international trip, which begins this week.

The firestorm over Comey's ouster comes on the heels of lower-voltage complaints about ways in which the Trump White House has reduced disclosure and transparency. The administration has ended the Obama White House practice of regularly releasing logs of White House visitors. The White House barred the U.S. press pool from taking photos at the beginning of the president's meeting with Russian officials last week. The press shop even refuses to disclose whether Trump is playing golf during his weekend visits to his golf clubs.

""President Trump has sacrificed his credibility (with) his outrageous disregard for the truth and his penchant for outrage,"" said Ron Klain, a senior White House aide in the Clinton and Obama administrations. ""It will be sorely missed when a crisis comes.""

Klain called Trump ""a polarizing president with a dubious relationship to facts"" who has created ""an environment where his supporters believe him even when he is lying, and more and more Americans won’t believe him even if he is telling the truth.""

Credibility is a precious political resource, says Frank Donatelli, a Republican consultant and political director in the Reagan White House.

""Presidential credibility can enhance public approval, as in 'he acts on what he believes,'"" Donatelli said, noting that personal popularity helped Reagan and other presidents succeed even when support for specific policies was lower. That's one reason a president's approval rating is so closely watched. ""A president's influence over events is directly related to his standing with the voting public. Members of Congress will be more deferential to a president with strong public support.""

Trump's rating seems relatively stable, ticking down just a bit in two surveys taken since FBI furor. His approval rating was 39% in both the Gallup and NBC/Wall Street Journal polls posted Sunday. That is an historic low for a modern president at this early point in his presidency, but it's just about where he has stood through the first 100 days of his tenure.

Trump allies also take comfort in the low approval ratings for those pressing the questions. Just 34% approve of the job congressional Democrats are doing, according to the Quinnipiac Poll. By 58%-37%, they disapprove of the way the news media cover Trump. But an even bigger majority, 65%-31%, disapprove of the way Trump talks about the news media. And by 57%-31%, they trust the news media over Trump to tell the truth about important issues.

On this, and other issues, there is a sharp partisan divide. Among Democrats, 91% trust the news media more. Among Republicans, 72% trust Trump more. Independents trust the news media by more than 2-1, 57%-27%. The survey of 1,078 people, taken May 4-9, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

Credibility has damaged officials beyond Trump. Based on assurances from then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, Vice President Mike Pence assured Americans that Flynn hadn't discussed U.S. sanctions in a conversation with Russian officials before the Inauguration; when that turned out to be untrue Flynn was fired.

House Intelligence Chairman Kevin Nunes (R-Calif.) was forced to step down from leading the panel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election after he became enmeshed in White House attempts to justify Trump’s debunked accusation of illegal wiretapping by Obama during the campaign.

Then there's Spicer, regularly dispatched to defend Trump's most provocative assertions, who was the target of a brutal parody on NBC's Saturday Night Live.

""Trump is innocent,"" the Spicer figure, portrayed by Melissa McCarthy, told a White House briefing in her role as Spicer. ""How do we know? Because he told us so. Period."" When she uses a motorized White House podium to track down Alec Baldwin, playing Trump, at his New Jersey golf course, she demands, ""Have you ever told me to say things that aren't true?""

""Only since you started working here,"" Baldwin replied.

Aric Almirola was released from a Kansas hospital Sunday morning after sustaining injuries in a multi-car crash Saturday night in the Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway.

Almirola sustained a compression fracture to his T5 vertebra but is mobile, his team, Richard Petty Motorsports, said in a statement. Almirola is scheduled to fly back to his home in Mooresville, N.C., Sunday and will be monitored by doctors in Charlotte this week.

Two weeks remain before the next Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series point race — the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway — with the non-points All-Star race this weekend, also at Charlotte.

Almirola, 33, caught the worst of a three-car collision with Joey Logano and Danica Patrick during Saturday's race. A part broke inside Logano's car, causing his No. 22 Ford to veer sharply to the left and hard into Danica Patrick's 10 Ford in Turn 1 shortly after a restart on Lap 69. Almirola, who was trailing, came up on the wreck and hit both cars hard, lifting the No. 43 Ford's back wheels off the racing surface.

MORE COVERAGE:

Almirola's window net was lowered but safety crews continued to work to release him from the car, removing the windscreen and cutting off the top of the car. He was alert when he was pulled from the car and was placed on a board before being airlifted to University of Kansas Medical Center.

Logano and Patrick were checked and released from the infield care center.

Almirola is competing in his 10th season in the NASCAR Cup Series and his sixth full-time with RPM. He won the 2014 summer race at Daytona International Speedway and has 10 career top-five finishes, including two this season — in the Daytona 500 and Talladega Superspeedway last weekend. Almirola also won the Xfinity Series race at Talladega a week ago.

The Tampa native is married to Janice and they have two children, Alex and Abby.

Denny Hamlin, who suffered a compression fracture in his lower back after a 2013 crash at Auto Club Speedway, shared his knowledge and tweeted support to Almirola on Twitter:

Feel bad for @aric_almirola. What makes this injury even worst is he will feel ready to return to racing before his body will allow him to. — Denny Hamlin (@dennyhamlin) May 14, 2017

Former NASCAR driver and current NBC commentator Jeff Burton also expressed empathy with Almirola on Twitter Sunday. Burton said he had compression fractures in three vertebrae during his career:

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday he is not worried about how much independence President Trump will give him to do his job despite Trump's decision last week to fire FBI Director James Comey in the midst of an FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

""I have a great relationship with the president,"" Tillerson told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on NBC News. ""I understand what his objectives are. When I'm not clear on what his objectives are, we talk about it. But I am devoted to helping the president achieve his objectives, helping him be successful. And I understand I have to earn his confidence every day with how I go about those affairs and how I go about conducting the State Department's activities consistent with the direction he wants to take the country.""

Tillerson made those comments in response to a question from Todd about whether Comey's abrupt firing would ""shake your concern"" about how much independence Trump would give him.

""Not at all,"" Tillerson replied.

Asked what the line between service to Trump and service to the country is for him, Tillerson said he ""will never compromise my own values.""

""And so that's my only line,"" he said. ""And my values are those of the country.""

However, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Tillerson recently for tell Department of State employees that ""conditioning our foreign policy too heavily on values creates obstacles to advance our national interests.""

""With those words, Secretary Tillerson sent a message to oppressed people everywhere, 'Don't look to the United States for hope,' "" McCain wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times last week.

""I make a distinction between values and policy,"" Tillerson said on Meet the Press. ""A policy has to be tailored to the individual situation. To the country. To its circumstances. To the broader issues that we are addressing in terms of advancing our national security interest, our national economic interest.""

""And so the values guide our policy, but if we put our values in the front of our policies and say, 'This is our policy,' we have no room to adapt to changing circumstances to achieve our ultimate objective,"" the secretary of State said. ""And I think if we are successful in achieving our ultimate diplomatic and national security objectives, we will create the conditions for the advancement of freedom in countries all over the world.""

One of those national security objectives, Tillerson said, is to try to establish a better relationship with Russia despite that nation's interference in last year's U.S. presidential election. ""The president, I think, has made it clear that he feels it's important that we re-engage with Russia,"" he said. ""The relationship with Russia, as he has described, and I have described as well, is I think at an all-time low point since the end of the Cold War, with a very low level of trust. I think it's in the interest of the American people, it's in the interest of Russia, the rest of the world, that we do something to see if we cannot improve the relationship between the two greatest nuclear powers in the world.""

Asked what repercussions the Russians should face for interfering in the U.S. election, Tillerson did not offer any specifics. ""They're (repercussions) just part of that broader landscape of conversations,"" he said. ""And I think the real impact is it serves yet again to undermine the trust between the United States and Russia...And so what we're exploring is how do we begin the process of restoring that trust.""

16,Miss USA 2017: Everything you need to know,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share 51 women from all 50 states plus DC will compete for the Miss USA 2017 crown. USA TODAY

Miss USA 2017 has a tough act to follow.

The Miss USA pageant, which returns this weekend, broke barriers last year by awarding the crown to U.S. Army Reserves captain Deshauna Barber. Not to be confused with its competitor, Miss America, Miss USA is a scholarship portion that also serves as the intermediate competition of the Miss Universe organization, with the winner moving onto the global Miss Universe pageant.

Ahead of this year's competition, here's everything you need to know.

How to watch

Miss USA will air live from the Mandalay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on FOX on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET/PT, and will stream via the FOX Now app for participating TV providers.

The hosts and judges

This year's panel of judges includes author and trans activist Janet Mock, The Real TV host Jeannie Mai, businesswoman and Dress for Success founder Nancy Lublin, TV personality Carson Kressley, former Miss Universe Brook Lee and the Somali-American model Halima Aden, who made history as the first woman to compete in a Miss USA state pageant wearing a hijab.

Dancing With The Stars judge Julianne Hough and actor Terrence J return to the competition this year as co-hosts, with model/author Ashley Graham interviewing contestants as Miss USA's backstage host.

The show will also feature performances from Pitbull and Brett Eldredge.

The contestants

51 women will compete in this year's Miss USA pageant, representing the 50 states and District of Columbia. The pool of contestants include lawyers, entrepreneurs, women's advocates and one newly-minted college grad: Miss Kentucky USA Madelynne Myers, who is skipping her Vanderbilt University graduation ceremony this weekend to compete for the Miss USA crown instead.

The swimsuit portion

Miss Teen USA, another pageant under the Miss Universe umbrella, made headlines by eliminating its swimsuit portion, with the contestants wearing athleisure instead. Miss USA host Julianne Hough told USA TODAY that while the swimsuit portion will still be featured in Sunday's competition, the Miss Universe organization is exploring other options.

""We’re still moving in that direction,"" she said. ""I’ve seen on social media, there’s a huge following in the pageant world and a lot of people like the old-school tradition of swimsuits. We’re not trying to come in and change tradition, but I definitely think that we are trying to be forward-thinking.""

The Q&A portion

The 2017 Miss USA pageant will debut a new Q&A format featuring user-submitted questions. In partnership with theSkimm, the competition is asking viewers to send their questions for the Miss USA finalists ahead of Sunday's show by submitting them online.

16,Paris Jackson: Why I love nudity,"Paris Jackson, fully clothed, at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)

Paris Jackson is naked and proud. The actress, model and daughter of Michael Jackson took to Instagram Saturday to explain, in a lengthy caption for a topless photo, why nudity helps her express herself.

""For those questioning what i stand for,"" she writes, nudity ""started as a movement for ‘going back to nature,’ ‘expressing freedom,’ ‘being healthier.’ "" Now, ""it helps me feel more connected to mama gaia.""

Being naked doesn't have to be a sexual thing, Jackson writes. ""Not only is your body a temple and should be worshipped as so, but also part of feminism is being able to express yourself in your own way, whether it's being conservative and wearing lots of clothes or showing yourself.""

The 19-year-old says she likes to, as she puts it, absorb ""mother earth's energy"" by walking barefoot in the soil and tanning her naked skin. The ""human body is a beautiful thing and no matter what 'flaws' you have,"" she says, ""and you should express yourself however you feel comfortable.""

And if you don't agree with her opinion of nudity, no worries: ""i completely understand and i encourage you to maybe no longer follow me, but i cannot apologize for this in any way,"" she says.

Here's the full post.

i'll say it again for those questioning what i stand for and how i express myself. nudity started as a movement for ‘going back to nature’, ‘expressing freedom’, ‘being healthier’ and was even called a philosophy. being naked is part of what makes us human. for me it helps me feel more connected to mama gaia. i'm usually naked when i garden. it's actually a beautiful thing and you don't have to make it sexual the way many hollywood stars (and the media) do. not only is your body a temple and should be worshipped as so, but also part of feminism is being able to express yourself in your own way, whether it's being conservative and wearing lots of clothes or showing yourself. there's different ways of absorbing mother earth's energy, my favorites are earthing which is absorbing the earths vibrations from contact between the soil and your bare feet, as well as letting your naked skin absorb the rays of the sun. the human body is a beautiful thing and no matter what ""flaws"" you have, whether it be scars, or extra weight, stretch marks, freckles, whatever, it is beautiful and you should express yourself however you feel comfortable. if this makes some of you upset i completely understand and i encourage you to maybe no longer follow me, but i cannot apologize for this in any way. it is who i am and i refuse to shy away and keep my beliefs a secret. every one as an opinion and every one has their beliefs. we don't always agree with one another and that's okay. but again, we are all human, and to appreciate the things that other people do that make us human helps us feel connected. how can that be a bad thing? A post shared by Paris-Michael K. Jackson (@parisjackson) on May 12, 2017 at 6:13pm PDT

Even those who don't follow Jackson on Instagram will be seeing plenty of the starlet soon when she makes her feature film debut in director Nash Edgerton's next movie for Amazon Studios.

9,Aric Almirola suffers back injury following Kansas crash | FOX Sports,"Aric Almirola suffered a compression fracture on his T5 vertebra in a fiery crash Saturday night at Kansas Speedway, a spokesperson for Richard Petty Motorsports said Sunday morning.

The good news is that Almirola has been released from a Kansas hospital and will fly home to Mooresville, N.C., today, the team said, noting that “Almirola is mobile and will follow-up with his doctors in Charlotte.”

Under the circumstances, that’s about as good a news as can be expected following the horrific crash.

The incident occurred just after a restart on Lap 199 of the 267-lap Go Bowling 400 at Kansas. It appeared that the right-front brake rotor on Joey Logano’s Team Penske Ford exploded in Turn 1 while he and Danica Patrick were racing for 11th place.

Logano’s damaged car turned left and hit Patrick, putting them both into the wall. Almirola, who was about 10 cars back couldn’t stop and hit Logano’s car at a high rate of speed in Turn 2.

Patrick and Logano were seen at the track’s infield care center and were released uninjured, but rescue workers had to cut the windshield and roof of Almirola’s car to extricate the injured driver during a 27-minute red flag period.

From there, Almirola was airlifted by helicopter to University of Kansas Medical Center where he spent the night.

A Richard Petty Motorsports representative said in a e-mail to FOXSoorts.com that the team will not know when Almirola will be able to return to the cockpit until after he meets with his doctors in Charlotte later this week.

Feel bad for @aric_almirola. What makes this injury even worst is he will feel ready to return to racing before his body will allow him to. — Denny Hamlin (@dennyhamlin) May 14, 2017

9,5 fights to make after UFC 211: Miocic vs. dos Santos 2 | FOX Sports,"Frankie Edgar vs. the winner of Jose Aldo vs. Max Holloway or Cub Swanson

Frankie Edgar stopped Yair Rodriguez’s hype train in its tracks Saturday night, stamping his claim to the No. 1 contender spot in the UFC featherweight division.

Edgar obviously deserves a title shot, but it’ll be a hard sell if Jose Aldo unifies the title against Max Holloway next month. Aldo is just one of three men to beat “The Answer” during his career and he’s done it twice.

If Aldo manages to keep the belt at UFC 212, I’d like to see him face off against Cub Swanson again in a No. 1 contender’s bout. The pair of featherweights fought back in 2014 and Edgar left with a fifth-round submission win in a fight he thoroughly dominated. But since then, Swanson has gone 4-1 and won back to back exciting decisions in bouts where he cracked 100 significant strikes, something he hadn’t done in his UFC or WEC career.

If Holloway wins, however, the UFC can go ahead and make Holloway vs. Edgar that night if they want to.",fox-sports
9,Watch Nacho's ridiculously cheeky goal to keep Real Madrid en route to the La Liga title | FOX Sports,"Real Madrid are chasing the La Liga and Champions League double, but the Spanish title comes first. To capture that trophy, they’re looking to win out because Barcelona are even on points with them and they need to take care of business to hold on. That meant beating Sevilla on Sunday.

They got off to a fantastic start with Nacho’s goal in the 10th minute, with the Spanish defender taking full advantage of some slack defending by Sevilla to fire his team ahead.

INCREÍBLE GOL, goooooooooooool del @realmadrid, gooooooooooooool de @nachofi1990 que madrugó a todos en un tiro libre #beINLaLiga pic.twitter.com/3h8yq0V7ON — beIN SPORTS Español (@ESbeINSPORTS) May 14, 2017

Marco Asensio was bundled over by Sevilla’s defense, but Nacho didn’t wait for the visitors to set up a wall, talk it out, or even really react. He saw the ball sitting still with a clear shot at goal, and he took matters into his own hands to put his side ahead.

Sevilla’s keeper Sergio Rico had no chance, their players were up in arms, and manager Jorge Sampaoli was furious, but the ref wasn’t having it. A free kick is meant to be an advantage for the attacking team, and Nacho took full advantage of it. Smart thinking, and it put his side in the driver’s seat for the title.

Nacho average goal.

9,Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has a hilarious strategy in store for the Warriors | FOX Sports,"As the chess match between the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs prepares to get underway, one of the biggest questions facing the underdog Spurs is how to combat the Warriors’ seemingly endless onslaught of scoring.

That strategic problem will fall upon Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who formulated a game plan that slowed down the Rockets’ offense in the West Conference semifinals. So how will Popovich pull off the same magic against the Warriors?

It’s pretty simple.

“Pray,” Popovich said after practice Saturday, via the San Antonio Express-News.

All jokes aside, the Spurs did win two of three regular-season matchups against the Warriors, but both teams rested a majority of their stars in one of San Antonio’s victories. The Spurs will have their hands full trying to keep the Warriors’ quartet of stars – Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green – under control in this series.

But it’s safe to say Popovich will have a more intricate game plan in store for Golden State, which is trying to reach the Finals for the third consecutive year, than what he’s already divulged.",fox-sports

Asked prior to Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway what he had planned for Mother’s Day, Bowyer laughed and said he worked on it all last week before he and his family arrived in his home state for the race.

“We had a great week,though,” he said. “I think you could call it a Mother’s Week. We took the family and road-tripped in a bus.

“Stopped in Memphis and went to the zoo, which I am sure she wanted to do. I think that is exactly what she wanted to do. Then we went to Big Cedar Lodge and swam in the pool for Cash and that is, I am sure, exactly what she wanted to do.

“Then we had a cabin where she slept in one bed with the baby and I slept in the other with Cash. So surely that is what she had in mind for a Mother’s Week. That is family living at its finest, right?”

Bernstein, a CNN contributor whose reporting for the Washington Post helped topple Nixon in the 1970s, said Sunday on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" that he is concerned Republicans in Congress haven't voiced more skepticism of President Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week.

Comey's department was investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""The Republicans during Watergate were heroic. They are the ones who said, 'What did the president know, and when did he know it?'"" Bernstein said.

He added that those Republicans investigated and supported the impeachment of Nixon ""because they were willing to see the truth served."" Nixon resigned before a trial in the U.S. Senate could happen.

Bernstein said there has not been ""something similar"" yet from Republicans today. He said while ""numerous"" members of the party have been quietly critical of Trump, conservative leadership has been either silent or supportive of him.

""It's a different dynamic than we've ever had to deal with before,"" he said. ""Richard Nixon was a criminal president. Donald Trump is a president with whom there is grave question about his fitness and ability to conduct the office of the president -- and that's going hand-in-hand with the possible coverup into collusion with a foreign power.""

Bernstein said he thinks it's more difficult for journalists to work today than during the Nixon era. Fewer people are interested in the ""best obtainable version of the truth,"" he said.

3,U.S.: Missile test shows North Korea 'a flagrant menace',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share South Korean President Moon Jae-In has condemned the North's latest missile launch as a ""reckless provocation"", staged days after his inauguration in an apparent test of the new administration. Video provided by AFP Newslook

North Korea's latest launch of a ballistic missile Sunday drew strong criticism from the United States and other nations.

The White House issued a statement late Saturday saying that North Korea has been ""a flagrant menace for too long,"" and that the latest “provocation” should serve as a call for all nations to implement stronger sanctions against the North. The statement also pointed out that the missile landed closer to Russia than to Japan, and that President Donald Trump “cannot imagine that Russia is pleased.""

A spokesman for China's foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, called the situation on the Korean peninsula ""complex and sensitive"" and that countries ""should not do things that further escalate tensions in the region.”

South Korean President Moon Jae-in called the launch a “clear” violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and a “serious challenge” to international peace and security. According to senior presidential secretary Yoon Young-chan, Moon expressed “deep regret” over the fact this “provocation” occurred just days after a new government was sworn in in South Korea.

The North Korean missile flew about 435 miles, South Korea's military said, and was a possible response to the election of Moon four days ago. It also comes as the U.S., Japanese and European militaries gather for war games in the Pacific.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the early morning launch but had few other details, including what type of ballistic missile was fired. A statement said that the missile was fired from near Kusong City, in North Phyongan province, and that the South Korean and U.S. militaries are analyzing the details.

Outsiders will be especially interested in what kind of projectile was fired. While North Korea regularly tests shorter-range missiles, it is also working to master the technology needed to field nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland.

Last week South Koreans elected a new president, Moon Jae-in, who favors a much softer approach than his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, who is in jail awaiting a corruption trial.

North Korea needs tests to perfect its missile program, but it also is thought to stage its launches after the elections of new U.S. and South Korean presidents in an attempt to gauge a new administration's reaction.

Moon called an emergency national security meeting Sunday, but he didn't immediately make any statement on the launch.

North Korea's past long-range satellite launches have been called clandestine tests of ICBM technology, but it is not believed to have tested a true intercontinental ballistic missile yet. The Trump administration has called North Korean ballistic and nuclear efforts unacceptable and has swung between threats of military action and offers to talk as it formulates a policy.

The launch also comes as troops from the U.S., Japan and two European nations gather on remote U.S. islands in the Pacific for drills that are partly a message to North Korea.

The launch comes the same day a senior North Korean diplomat who handles relations with the United States said Pyongyang would hold talks with Washington under the ""right conditions,"" according to Yonhap.

Choe Son-hui, director-general of the North America affairs bureau of the North Korean foreign ministry, told reporters at the Beijing Capital International Airport that North Korea ""will hold dialogue under right conditions"" with the new U.S. administration.

The two countries have not held formal, face-to-face talks since 2008 when international efforts to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program collapsed.

In an interview in April with Reuters, President Trump warned that a “major, major conflict” with North Korea was possible, but said he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to the issue of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

The president also told Bloomberg News recently that he would meet North Korean president Kim Jong Un ""under the right circumstances.""

""If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,"" Trump said in the interview.

Their chief protagonist in pursuit of that goal is one Kylian Mbappe.

Against Lille on Sunday, Mbappe did what he’s done to defenders all season: ruin their lives.

It wasn’t enough for Mbappe to race in behind Franck Beria like the Lille man was hopping on one leg. He then pulled out a combo of skill moves so mesmerizing he didn’t so much dribble past Beria as his defender simply electric slid out of his way like a genial bouncer inviting him into Club Goal.

Mbappe, ever the team player, didn’t even take the shot after that. Instead, he passed to Bernardo Silva, because, like any true Sauce Lord knows, you don’t have to score the goal. You just have to be responsible for the embarrassment that leads to the goal.

As it stands, Monaco will end the match day with their fate in their hands, with two matches left and a three point lead on PSG with a game in hand.

9,Dustin Poirier plans to appeal no contest against Eddie Alvarez at UFC 211 | FOX Sports,"Dustin Poirier isn’t going down without a fight.

The veteran lightweight engaged in a war of attrition with Eddie Alvarez at UFC 211 on Saturday night in Dallas, but the end of the fight and the ruling on the decision didn’t sit very well with him or his team.

It all went down in the second round after Poirier and Alvarez had both come close to finishing the fight in a flurry of strikes being exchanged. The end came after Alvarez unleashed a series of knee strikes to the head with the final slamming into the side of Poirier’s head before he crumpled to the mat.

Unfortunately for Alvarez, the final two knees he landed were both illegal because Poirier had his hand on the mat for the first strike and both of his legs were on the ground when the final blow struck him in the head. Because Poirier was considered a downed fighter, Alvarez’s knees to the head were deemed illegal.

Rewatch what happened at the end of Eddie Alvarez vs. Dustin Poirier #UFC211 https://t.co/st9wBPfYUh — FOX Sports: UFC (@UFCONFOX) May 14, 2017

Despite the foul, referee Herb Dean decided to call the knees “unintentional” and when Poirier was not allowed to continue based on the advice of the ringside physician, the fight was declared a no contest.

On Sunday, Poirier’s manager Robert Roveta from Denaro Sports Marketing informed FOX Sports that they plan on filing an appeal with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to have the no contest overturned to a disqualification.

Poirier’s team has already notified the UFC about filing the appeal as well due to the nature of the illegal strikes bringing the fight to an end, which they believe should have earned Poirier a victory rather than a no contest.

Perhaps the toughest part for Poirier is that a no contest means he doesn’t get his contracted win bonus for the fight with Alvarez, which cuts his paycheck in half.

Add to that, Poirier has a no contest on his record where his team believes he should be leaving UFC 211 with a win over the former lightweight champion.",fox-sports

9,Brian Stann: Dustin Poirier deserved win over Eddie Alvarez instead of a no-contest | FOX Sports,"Dustin Poirier left Dallas on Saturday night after a disappointing end to his fight with former lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez due to a trio of illegal strikes that brought about the end of the contest.

It all went down in an action packed second round that saw Poirier and Alvarez on the verge of finishing the fight. Unfortunately the end came after Alvarez had Poirier pinned against the cage where he unleashed a series of knee strikes to the head with the final one nearly knocking out the American Top Team fighter.

The bad news for Alvarez was that Poirier’s knees were down on the mat, which meant he was not allowed to throw knees to the head and the strikes were deemed illegal. Despite the foul, Alvarez was not disqualified but instead the strikes were called “accidental” and the fight was declared a no-contest.

“The fight was awesome. Dustin Poirier was putting on perhaps his best performance since he’s moved to lightweight. Maintaining his range, combinations, he hurt Alvarez bad. Then Alvarez showed off his heart. He was hurt significantly, fought his way back into this fight and then here come the knees. All clearly illegal. These are not the new rules, these are the old rules and it wouldn’t matter anyways,” UFC analyst Brian Stann explained on the UFC 211 post fight show on FS1.

“Now the decision is made to call it a no contest. A DQ [disqualification] and a no contest. No. These are illegal moves. That should be a disqualification, a win for Dustin Poirier, who was most likely up two rounds to none.”

Probably the hardest part for Poirier is that he misses out on half of his contracted salary for the fight because he won’t receive a win bonus due to the bout ending in a no contest.

Stann knows that Alvarez isn’t a dirty fighter but the strikes he landed were still illegal and should have been treated as a foul that brought about the end of the fight.

Instead, Poirier walks away with a no contest, half his pay and no satisfaction despite the fight ending due to an illegal blow.

“Look I get it, Eddie Alvarez is in a fist fight, he’s not thinking through that, but regardless, it’s still a foul,” Stann said. “If you’re going to make the rule and it’s going to be a foul then treat it as a foul and say OK nobody wins.

“It’s not how it’s supposed to go.”",fox-sports

6,James Woolsey: It'll be hard to find a 'willing' FBI director,"Story highlights James Woolsey tells Fareed Zakaria he was ""troubled"" by James Comey's firing

Woolsey says he's disturbed by reports that President Trump had asked for Comey's ""loyalty""

(CNN) Former CIA Director James Woolsey told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that he believed it would be tough to find a ""willing"" candidate to replace fired FBI Director James Comey.

""I find this whole thing, this whole week, to be very troubling for inchoate ways and inchoate reasons,"" he told Zakaria, referring to President Trump's firing of Comey, who had been in the middle of investigating possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia's interference in last year's election.

Woolsey, who served as Director of Central Intelligence under President Clinton, added that he also was surprised by reports that President Trump had asked then-Director Comey to pledge his loyalty to him shortly after he took office.

""As far as loyalty is concerned, we're senior government officials — our loyalty ought to be to the Constitution. We're not in medieval England, people aren't trying to stage coups and so forth,"" he told Zakaria.

As for how he might have responded to such a request, Woolsey said it was simple.

10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Image 1 of 3 Windows 10 is getting a big makeover Image 2 of 3 Hello white taskbar Image 3 of 3 Apps get a new look too

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar

10,The best cheap Apple Watch deals in May 2017,"Finding cheap Apple Watch deals is a difficult task in 2017 because this is the Apple’s newest product category. Apple Watch price drops remain rare.

Good news: we’re here to help you avoid paying full price for an Apple Watch, and it all depends on where you shop. You also don’t necessarily have to own the brand new Apple Watch 2.

Yes, the Apple Watch 2 is the best Apple Watch you can own. However, the refreshed Apple Watch Series 1 and older original Apple Watch are just as good for certain people.

Here’s a list of the best Apple Watch deals for all four variations of the smartwatch as well as a few places to buy the cheap Apple Watch bands at a discount. Don’t let this accessory add up, either.

Apple Watch 2 deals

Fitness takes over the Apple Watch

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Water-resistant

GPS onboard

Expensive

Lack of useful apps

Apple Watch 2 is the most expensive iPhone-compatible smartwatch you can own, and for good reason. It includes specs and features not available for the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1. This includes GPS tracking, a brighter screen and waterproof specs that let it operate in a pool. All of that sounds great, until you see the expensive price tag, especially for the Ceramic Apple Watch 2. Aluminum cases make for the cheapest Apple Watch 2, followed by stainless steel and ceramic. There’s no gold model anymore, but more intricate Apple Watch bands do lead to higher prices. In other words, you have to ‘watch out’ and shop smartly when picking out your Apple Watch 2 below.

Limited fitness app

Not always accurate

The Apple Watch Nike Plus Edition is actually the newest Apple Watch 2, one that’s dressed in sporty colors like neon green along its perforated Sport Band. It’s brilliant looking. Yes, you can now buy the Apple Watch Nike Plus Edition bands separately, but you can't get the exclusive Nike running watch faces. The problem is this smartwatch is just as expensive as the Apple Watch 2 and less likely to see a price drop right away. Apple and Nike, after all, launched it a month after the Watch 2. There are places in which you can find a cheap Apple Watch Nike Plus, and places like Amazon that have third-party retailers jacking up the price on this sought-after Nike Apple Watch. Be careful out there.

Apple Series 1 deals

The best Apple Watch for most non-runners

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S1P dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: splash-proof | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

The best Apple Watch for most people

Faster performance than Apple Watch 1

Lacks Series 2's bright screen

No GPS and not waterproof





The Apple Watch Series 1 is actually the best Apple Watch for most people who aren’t all-star runners and avid swimmers. It has most of the specs you need on a smartwatch. This is a refreshed Apple Watch compared to the original Apple Watch, so it has a faster dual-core processor and better battery life as a result. It runs all the same watchOS 3 software. Best of all, the much cheaper Apple Watch Series 1 price doesn’t leave out a whole lot. If you don’t need to track GPS runs and swim with it on, you’ll save money. The discounted Apple Watch Series 1 still comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, but only has the more economical an aluminum case and Sport band. It’s the best Apple Watch value.

Original Apple Watch deals

The iPhone-tailored smartwatch merely a convenient gadget

OS: watchOS 3 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53"" OLED | Processor: S1 System-in-Package (SiP) | Band sizes: Varies drastically per style | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

Cheapest Apple Watch now

Include heart-rate monitor

Noticeably slower performance

Battery life is one (waking) day

The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company’s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015. No, the Apple Store doesn’t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount. The best part – besides the cheap Apple Watch 1 price – is the fact that it runs watchOS 3 with all the same apps as an Apple Watch 2. It’s a vast improvement over the launch software.

Apple Watch band/strap deals

Bands are not one-size-fits-all-budgets

Wide variety of sizes, colors and prices

Incredibly easy to slide onto your Watch

Can't use normal watch straps

Official Apple Watch bands are pricey

Your Apple Watch literally isn’t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.

In fact, you’re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don’t cut it at the fancy dinner table.

Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they’re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. Plus, you'll want to save up for the eventually Apple Watch 3.",techradar
10,Google's Project Treble will actually let you experience the latest Android updates,"Google’s new Project Treble is set to speed up the time it takes for your phone to get access to Android O, the upcoming release that’s now confirmed for Summer.



Traditionally, if you buy a phone that’s not made by Google, you run the risk of waiting weeks, months, or even years for it to be updated to the latest and greatest operating system available.



This changes that, or so Google says, with Treble being its “biggest change yet to low-level system architecture.” In a nutshell, Google’s work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push the new software that you so desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.



Posted in the Android developers blog , the big difference that will help speed things along for your preferred device maker is that Google is pushing for phones released moving forward to feature vendor implementation, part of the greater Android architecture, that won’t need to be updated with each new OS release.



According to the post, it’s the interface that gives developers access to “hardware-specific features of Android.” With these changes in place, manufacturers will have far fewer things to rework with the next major update.

A big step forward?",techradar
10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Just days before IO, Google announced Project Treble to speed up the time it takes for phones to receive Android O. The new version of Android, by the way, is also confirmed to release this summer.

Project Treble aims to cut down on the fragmentation that can plague Android releases, when users wait months or even years to get the latest flavor of Android on their devices. It will be easier for manufacturers to push out new software, starting with Android O.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is calling this year's IO an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: General admission Google IO 2017 tickets cost $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks as part of the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, What's New in Android will dive into topics such as the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O will offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's New & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" which could be a sign Google will talk about Android Wear 3.0 at the conference.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build them. While this may be a bit too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O next week.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features in the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

Google also announced Project Treble in the days before IO, which will help users get the latest flavor of Android more quickly. In a nutshell, Google's work here is to make it easier for manufacturers to push new software that you want desire to your phone, cutting down on the time and money requirements that were previously necessary.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

ZTE Quartz review: The latest Android Wear 2 smartwatch

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
10,Tesla's new moonshot is solar energy — here's why it might just work,"Tesla is a powerhouse in the modern tech world, and for good reason. The company's push for electric cars has captivated consumers, investors and industry observers, and the result is that Tesla is now the most valuable American car company . CEO Elon Musk has even set his sights on overtaking Apple one day in terms of company worth.

More recently, Tesla's focus has broadened, and it's made a different kind of push, one that aims to capture energy from the sun and use it to power people's homes.

The move makes sense. Tesla isn't just a car manufacturer; it's a multi-pronged company aiming for unseen heights in renewable energy. Tesla wants to radically transform how we access and use energy in our everyday lives, and to that end it's spearheading two different products: solar panels and solar roof tiles, also known as the Tesla Solar Roof.

Tesla's solar products are remarkably different than what we're used to seeing. Not only are the designs sleeker than traditional solar panels, but Tesla claims they are also cheaper, and that's before the savings you can expect on your power bill.

There are, of course, plenty of questions. How does Tesla plan to implement this new wave of solar power products? Is its technology really cheaper and more effective than traditional solar panels? Can Tesla pull off completely transforming home energy consumption, forever?

Tesla and solar energy: a brief history

Tesla's mission in solar and beyond is clear: the company wants to re-imagine how we consume energy. You might not know, however, that this plan actually isn't new.

In the 'Secret Tesla Motors Plan (just between you and me),' a blog post written in 2006, Musk described his grand vision to transform Tesla into more than a car company.

""...the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution,"" wrote Musk.

Tesla started laying the groundwork for that transformation long before it announced any solar panel. Critical to using green energy is the ability to store it, and Tesla came up with a way to do just that in the Powerwall. First announced in 2015, the Tesla Powerwall serves as a battery to store energy captured by solar panels and tiles.

Tesla Powerwall battery

The Powerwall stores energy collected from a solar roof or tiles, and even from the electric grid. The stored energy can be used to power a home when there's no sunlight, or when the cost of electricity is higher, such as during the early evening hours.

While the original Powerwall came at a cost of $3,000 or more, the new and improved Powerwall 2 starts at $5,500, largely because it includes a built-in power inverter.

This means the unit will convert captured energy from the sun into energy that can actually be used in your home. Previously, you would had to buy an inverter separately.

With its Powerwall in place, Tesla took an even bigger step in becoming a solar power powerhouse in August 2016 when it purchased SolarCity for $2.6 billion. Founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, SolarCity specializes in the installation and development of solar panels. The SolarCity acquisition was a huge deal for Tesla; with SolarCity under its wing, Tesla can deploy full solar systems, complete with solar roofs, batteries, and so on.

Catching rays

Part of the appeal of Tesla's solar solutions are how aesthetically appealing they are: they are sleek, modern-looking, and blend in seamlessly. Tesla proved energy efficiency doesn't have to come at the cost of curb appeal with the Model S and Model X, and it's doing so again with its solar tech.

It's important to reiterate that Tesla has two solar products right now: its more traditional solar panels and the Solar Roof, which looks like standard (yet beautiful) roof shingles, but serve as both roofing and solar panels.

But looks will only take you so far, and Tesla has made its solar solutions functional, too.

The technology used in its tiles is a new form of solar technology, and thus a bit of a change for Tesla.

When Tesla first launched the Model S, it did so using a slew of existing technologies and battery cells built by Panasonic. With its solar tiles, Tesla has tapped a new technology built by Silevo, a company that was acquired by SolarCity for $200 million in 2014. That technology, however, is still somewhat new, and it's unproven in large-scale manufacturing, according to a report from The Buffalo News . So, while the technology works in the lab, it's still unclear if it can be as efficient on a larger scale.

Look just like shingles, right?

The tiles essentially incorporate different layers — a layer of glass on the top, then layers of various films, then solar cells, which convert light into electricity. Silevo technology uses what's called a ""heterojunction cell,"" and while the details of the technology get technical, the point is this: Silevo tech could offer an efficiency of up to 22%, which is greater than averages of between 10% and 15% more traditional panels achieve.

There are still a few things that are a unclear about Tesla's tiles at this point, however. Tesla is expected to use both Silevo and Panasonic technology in its solar products, but these will need to prove they can work considering Silevo is still considered somewhat experimental.

It also appears as though Tesla has taken a step back from Silevo because of its partnership with Panasonic as well, but that doesn't mean it's ditching the tech altogether. Instead, it's likely the technology just needs some more development to be effective on a mass scale.

Tesla's solar panels

Meanwhile, Tesla's solar panels, announced in April 2017, are different than the solar tiles. They look more like traditional panels, albeit sleeker. This is thanks to a much lower profile than other solar panel offerings, making them not as immediately noticeable.

According to Tesla, the panels ""exceed industry standards for durability and lifespan."" The panels aren't actually built by Tesla, but rather by Panasonic, which are then re-sold by Tesla. These don't use the Silevo technology found in the tiles.

'Plug it in and use it'

In addition to a pleasing design, experts argue the intelligence of Tesla's software combined with its Powerwall home batteries will be the real draw to home owners.

Tesla has revealed little about the software behind Powerwall, but on the consumer level it can monitor energy usage in real-time and features intelligence that allows it to automatically adjust its settings according to your usage needs and daily routine. While you don't necessarily need a Powerwall, it helps Tesla solar users get the most out of their panels or tiles.

""Tesla is using existing off-the-shelf battery technology [lithium ion] but bundles its very tech-smart information systems design to make storage just as easy as solar,"" Daniel Kammen, Professor of Energy at the University of California, Berkeley, tells TechRadar. In other words, solar energy is already easy, and Tesla makes storing it just as simple.

""Plug it in and use it,"" Kammen said.

This end-to-end package isn't something other solar companies seem to have mastered: they don't use solar to its full potential, and all the energy captured during the day can't be used at night without a decent battery. With Powerwall, Tesla is delivering a holistic solution to consumers.

Real solar savings?

While solar energy in general saves money on electric bills, it's still expensive to install, so you may not feel like you've saved money for quite some time if you go Tesla's route. Still, the company argues that eventually you will see worthwhile savings on energy use.

According to Tesla, the real savings are to be found in its Solar Roof. And we’re not just talking the cost of the tiles compared to other solar products: Musk said during an earnings call in November that installing its roof is cheaper than installing standard roof tiles. And that's before the money you save from the energy it generates.

""Electricity,"" Musk said, ""is just a bonus.""

Electricity is just a bonus Tesla CEO Elon Musk

But is this claim of cheaper costs true? Well, it's complicated. According to Musk, the solar tiles are cheaper than the cost of concrete or ceramic roof tiles. Those, however, are among the more expensive roof tiles out there, running between $400 and $2,000 per 100 square feet, according to The Motley Fool .

So while Tesla's roofing may end up being cheaper than some traditional materials, it will only be cheaper than the more expensive traditional materials.

Tesla unveiled pricing for its Solar Roof earlier this week, so we can helpfully run the numbers. On average, a Solar Roof will cost $21.85 per square foot for a 3,000-square-foot roof, although that pricing depends on factors like location and the ratio of solar to non-solar tiles you purchase.

Here's what you'll see when Tesla spits out your Solar Roof estimate

Because pricing varies home-to-home, Tesla launched an online calculator to figure out price estimates.

For this story, we plugged in a 3,000-foot-square roof in Sunnyvale, California, and received a roof installation estimate of $79,500, plus $7,000 for the Tesla Powerwall. Undoubtedly that's a lot of money, but for the materials used and the type of roof you're getting, it's actually around the same price as a non-solar roof.

According to Consumer Reports , a traditional Slate Tile roof would cost around $98,500 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, making it more expensive than the $79,500 Textured or Smooth Glass roof we calculated for our fictional Sunnyvale home.

What's more, you start saving after the initial install. In California, you would get a $21,000 tax credit for installing such a roof, and Tesla says the roof would generate $113,900 of energy over the next 30 years. At the end of the 30 years, you will have paid off your roof, and generated an extra $48,400 worth of energy. In the long run, your solar roof would cost zero dollars, and you could even make money from it by selling the extra energy.

An important part of Tesla's equation is the ratio of solar tiles to non-solar tiles. Tesla's roofing is actually built from a combination of solar and non-solar tiles, and you can adjust the ratio you want installed. Using fewer solar tiles and more non-solar tiles will result in a cheaper installation cost, but less energy generated.

Tesla's solar tiles are, at least on paper, worth it the investment, even if you weren't thinking of getting a more expensive slate glass roof. Traditional roofing simply can't generate money, and will only cost you in repairs and replacements. Even cheaper asphalt tile roofing, which costs around $20,000 to install on a 3,000-foot-square roof, will cost you more money over time.

And what about the more traditional Panasonic-made solar panels Tesla recently unveiled? Are they more affordable and cost effective than other panels? Unfortunately, we can’t know yet as Tesla hasn't announced pricing for its panels.

We can do a bit of sleuthing, however. Solar Power Authority , which offers quotes for panels, says the average cost of solar panels is around $5-$6 per watt including installation. That puts a 5kW system between $25,000 and $30,000.

Tesla’s Panasonic modules each offer 325 watts, so each module should sit between $1,625 and $1,950. They likely won’t be sold by individual modules, but any less than that would be considered a good price to pay.

Tesla solar takes flight

Tesla is still working on its solar products, and in fact only two of its four solar tile options are available this year, with the others arriving in 2018. The two up for pre-order now are Textured Glass and Smooth Glass, and next year will see Slate Glass and Tuscan Glass.

Tesla's venture into solar may still be in the early stages, but already it's poised to be an influential player in the renewable energy world, helped by unique products, a respected business model and name recognition.

""Tesla has both a fantastic technology solution that is available right now, and a great brand and market research,"" said UC Berkeley's Kammen. ""This is a powerful combination.""

The big question now is whether home owners actually buy a Tesla Solar Roof or panels. Residential solar is on the rise in the US, but while 2016 was the market's biggest year to date, the number of residential solar installations in the country still only totals somewhere above one million, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The climb to widespread residential solar adoption is steep, but with Tesla joining the fray, more homeowners may now consider switching to solar, whether for the installation price, long-term savings, to be an early adopter, or all of the above.

What is clear is Tesla is serious about solar, and we expect to learn about improvements in the technology, cheaper pricing and even more energy products in the months and years to come.",techradar

4,When Only Memories Can Fill The Cracks,"When I was a teenager, I drew the floor plan of my house a lot. It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed

9,Kevin Durant debuts his new signature sneakers in Game 1 vs. Spurs | FOX Sports,"Nike officially unveiled its latest signature sneaker for Kevin Durant on Sunday, and Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Spurs was the perfect setting for the KD10 to make its on-court debut, courtesy of Durant himself.

The overall design is very similar to that of the KD9, with a couple of notable tweaks. The sneaker is decked out in what the company says is the most advanced Flyknit ever produced for basketball -- a ""low stretch, high-tenacity (think seat belt) yarn at stress points and a high stretch yarn at the collar and across the forefoot [which] yields a perfect balance of basketball-specific support and a sock-like hug.""

The other important change is the lacing system. On the KD9, the laces were mostly just decorative, but the new design looks like it'll be a lot easier to secure that all-important locked-down fit.

""It is one element [designer Leo Chang] and I talk about when working designs — one thing that goes under the radar is the laces,"" Durant says. ""To have Flyknit and a unique lacing pattern was key for us.""

6,Clapper: US institutions 'under assault' from Trump,"Washington (CNN) Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Sunday that he thinks US institutions are under assault from President Donald Trump.

""I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally -- and that's the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system -- and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally,"" Clapper told anchor Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Pressed if he meant US institutions were under assault internally from the President, Clapper responded, ""Exactly.""

Clapper called on the other branches of the federal government to step up in their roles as a check on the executive.

""The founding fathers, in their genius, createdya a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances,"" Clapper said. ""I feel as though that is under assault and is eroding.""

Democrats and several Republicans in Congress have publicly mulled pressing the Department of Justice to appoint a special prosecutor or establishing an independent investigative body that could look into allegations of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in what the US intelligence community says was Moscow's efforts to influence the US election.

The Senate must confirm a new FBI director once Trump names a candidate; that FBI director will take a lead role in the Russia investigation.

Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee advocated on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Trump appoint Judge Merrick Garland to head the FBI. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said later on the program that the Republican leader had just called him to say he would support Garland for FBI's top spot.

Garland was President Barack Obama's pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia after Scalia's death last year. If appointed and confirmed as FBI director, Garland's appointment would create a vacancy on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has jurisdiction over the DC area and federal agencies, making it one of the highest legal authorities in the country short of the Supreme Court.

Can't refute or confirm collusion questions

Clapper also said Sunday that the President and the White House are wrong to cite Clapper's previous Senate testimony on the questions about alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia as proof that no such collusion exists, emphasizing that no one should portray his comments as ""exculpatory"" -- something Trump has done repeatedly on Twitter.

Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

""The bottom line is I don't know if there was collusion, political collusion,"" Clapper told Tapper. ""I don't know of any evidence to it. So I can't refute it, and I can't confirm it.""

Clapper told NBC in March that he didn't know of any evidence that demonstrated collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing earlier this month, Clapper clarified that statement, saying he was also unaware of the FBI's investigation into the matter until Comey made it public in March.

At that subcommittee hearing, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, whom Trump fired in January for refusing to defend his initial temporary ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority countries and suspension of the entry of Syrian refugees, declined to answer the question of whether there was evidence of collusion publicly; in her answer, she also noted that Clapper had been unaware of the FBI investigation.

Clapper said Sunday that his ""standard practice"" as the leader of the intelligence community during the Obama administration was to defer to the FBI on any counterintelligence investigations.

He noted the intelligence community's joint assessment declaring Russia had interfered in the 2016 election did not contain any reporting about political collusion.

""I did not have any evidence,"" Clapper said, again noting he was unaware of the executive branch investigation into allegations of collusion.

Comey and Trump

On Friday, Trump raised eyebrows by tweeting a warning to Comey, whom he fired unexpectedly on Tuesday, about leaking information to the media, saying he ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.""

In his news briefing later that day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined repeatedly to explain what the tweet meant or address questions about whether there were recording devices in the Oval Office.

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Trump and Comey had a private dinner in the White House on January 27 in which a source close to Comey said the President asked the FBI director to pledge his loyalty, which Comey, who reportedly was taken aback by the request, refused to do.

The dinner was on the same day that Yates went to the White House to warn the administration about since-ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn's potential vulnerability to Russian blackmail and that Trump issued the executive order restricting travel from several majority-Muslim nations.

Clapper said Sunday that he spoke with Comey prior to the dinner while at an event at FBI headquarters in Washington.

""He mentioned to me the invitation he had from the President for dinner,"" Clapper said. ""He was -- my characterization -- uneasy with it both from the standpoint of the optic of compromising his independence and the independence of the FBI.""",cnn

The injury, which Leonard initially suffered in Game 5 of the second round series against the Rockets, kept him out of Game 6.

Leonard initially tweaked the ankle on Sunday while running near his team’s bench, but after tightening up his shoelaces, he was able to remain in the game. A borderline dirty play from Warriors’ center Zaza Pachulia — where he undercut Leonard as he attempted to land after a jump shot — was the one that sent Leonard to the locker room for the remainder of the contest.

But for Marlins closer AJ Ramos, he got the opportunity to honor his mom on her special day in a unique and memorable way.

With Miami leading the Braves 3-1 heading into the ninth, Ramos took the mound for his first save opportunity in 23 days — with his mother watching from the stands.

With two outs and a runner on second, Matt Kemp flied out to end the game and Ramos recorded his fourth save of the season. And just like an adoring son would do, Ramos secured the ball and brought it to his mom, Cynthia, in a heartwarming Mother’s Day moment.

The North Koreans launched another missile just days after the engine test, but it exploded ""within seconds of launch,"" according to US Pacific Command. As March wound down, Pyongyang once again went back to its engine tests -- technology could possibly be used in an eventual ICBM.

After the attempted test, US Vice President Mike Pence, visiting the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) on April 17, warned North Korea not to test the resolve of the US ""or the strength of our military forces.""

North Korea's UN deputy representative, Kim In Ryong, responded, warning that the US actions and rhetoric have ""created a dangerous situation in which thermonuclear war may break out at any moment on the peninsula and poses a serious threat to world peace and security.""

After boasting that the USS Carl Vinson strike group was being dispatched to the Korean Peninsula in a ""show of force,"" the US was forced to walk back the claims after it emerged that the ships in question were actually on their way to participate in military exercises in the Indian Ocean , some 3,500 miles in the opposite direction.

Instead, the strike group will arrive off the Korean Peninsula by the end of April, multiple US defense officials told CNN.

Russia denied it had previously blocked the action, saying that it wanted to add language to the document.

North Korea launched a missile April 29 that blew up over land, a US official said. The missile failed to reach the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

3,Russian money-laundering details remain in the dark as US settles fraud case,"New York (CNN) A major US investigation into Russian money laundering has come to an abrupt end.

The case aimed to expose how Russian mobsters allegedly stole $230 million and hid some of the cash in New York City real estate. Also sure to come up was the suspicious death of the Russian lawyer who exposed the alleged fraud, though US prosecutors weren't alleging that the defendants were behind it.

The trial was set to start on Monday, but late Friday night, federal prosecutors in New York announced they settled the case with Prevezon, the company accused of buying up ""high-end commercial space and luxury apartments"" with laundered money.

The abrupt conclusion has some involved in the trial wondering why this Russian investigation had been cut short.

""What most concerns me is: Has there been any political pressure applied in this?"" asked Louise Shelley, an illicit finance expert who was set to testify in support of the US government on Tuesday.

Shelley — who founded George Mason University's Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center — said the alleged money launderers got off easy.

""I think they won something. There's no recognition of wrongdoing,"" she said.

The US Attorney's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

In the settlement, Prevezon and its business associates did not acknowledge any wrongdoing, and the government agreed to ""release"" them all from any future lawsuits in connection with this case.

The case against Prevezon was a civil matter, so the federal government's inherent goal was to recover money. That it did.

The $5.9 million settlement is three times the value of the $1.9 million in supposedly laundered money tied to funds stolen from the Russian state coffers. But it's far less than the value of Prevezon's real estate in Manhattan -- which Shelley estimates at $17 million -- that had been partially acquired with those allegedly laundered funds.

Russia's largest ever tax fraud

The alleged fraud behind the Prevezon case goes back a decade. According to US investigators, corrupt Russian government officials allegedly teamed up with a powerful Russian organized crime organization to pull off that country's largest ever tax fraud.

Russian crime rings often use identity theft to file fake tax refunds. In this case, the government says that the defendants essentially did that on a grand scale: allegedly stealing the corporate identity of Hermitage Capital Management, an investment firm in Russia. According to the complaints, the defendants then allegedly created fake losses, claimed fake tax refunds -- and made off with the stolen rubles.

Hermitage's lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, exposed the alleged fraud — and was later jailed by the very investigators he fingered in the plot. He was tortured and killed in prison, according to Russia's own Presidential Human Rights Commission. The Russian government insists that Magnitsky, age 37, died of a heart failure with no signs of violence.

The conspirators allegedly laundered the illicit cash through shell companies, luxury cars, real estate around the world, and international bank accounts.

But without a trial, the illicit money trail remains unproven to the public.

The settlement allowed both sides to still claim a victory.

Prevezon said this is proof it did nothing wrong. In a statement, the firm said: ""From the outset, Prevezon and its owner Denis Katsyv have maintained their innocence and have repeatedly stated that they had no involvement in or knowledge of any fraudulent activities and never received any funds from any criminal activity.""

Prevezon claimed prosecutors ""brought this case without conducting any independent investigation, relying exclusively on the claims of William Browder,"" the head of Hermitage.

Meanwhile, American prosecutors claimed this served as a deterrent for future money launderers.

""We will not allow the U.S. financial system to be used to launder the proceeds of crimes committed anywhere -- here in the U.S., in Russia, or anywhere else,"" acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H. Kim said in a statement.

The case had initially been brought by US Attorney Preet Bharara, but he was fired by President Donald Trump in March.

Bharara congratulated the prosecutors on Twitter late Friday night : ""Congrats to Joon & team in Russian money laundering case (underlying fraud uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, died suspiciously in Moscow jail).""

There was one witness set to testify at the trial who had a very personal connection to the case: Jamison Firestone, whose law firm partner was Magnitsky.

On Saturday, Firestone lamented that details about the Russian government, mobsters and investors who allegedly received these funds won't be aired at trial.

""I wanted this all to come out,"" he told CNN on Saturday. ""The embarrassing stuff exposes the Russian government's entire money laundering machine.""

But Firestone said this settlement is one step closer to justice. Estonia, the UK, and the US have already adopted ""Magnitsky laws"" to sanction Russians connected to the fraud. This settlement is the first time a court in the West has forced someone allegedly involved in the money laundering to pay up.

""We're just going to keep doing this until we expose them all,"" he told CNN. ""These people may escape prosecution as long as the Putin government stands, but it won't stand forever. Putin is going to die before they do, and hopefully they will die in tiny prison cells like Sergei Magnitsky did.""",cnn

Cyber-attacks that have hit 150 countries since Friday should be treated by governments around the world as a ""wake-up call"", Microsoft says.

The computing giant said software vulnerabilities hoarded by governments have caused ""widespread damage"".

The latest virus exploits a flaw in Microsoft Windows first identified by US intelligence.

There are fears of further ""ransomware"" attacks as people return to work on Monday.

Many firms have had experts work over the weekend to prevent new infections. The virus took control of users' files, demanding payments to restore access.

The spread of the virus slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have warned. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far.

A statement released by Microsoft on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems.

""We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world.

""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Firms must patch their systems before Monday morning, Europol chief warns

It added: ""The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.""

Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.

""As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,"" the company said.

Temporary fix

Meanwhile Europol's chief told the BBC that that the ransomware was designed to allow ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"", adding: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.""

Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said.

A UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".

MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.

Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.

""Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,"" she said.

In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.

Other organisations targeted worldwide included Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's Interior Ministry.",bbc-news

From Inauguration Day on, President Trump and his administration has made assertions that turned out to be untrue. Here are a half-dozen examples.

But photographs shot from the top of the Washington Monument shot at similar times showed a significantly smaller crowd than at Barack Obama's Inauguration in 2009.

Trump tweet: ""Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!""

But FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper say that didn't happen.

Trump tweet: ""This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

But Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers testified to Congress that Russia did try to influence the election in Trump's favor.

Trump: The U.S. was “sending an armada,"" led by the Carl Vinson Strike Group, to counter the North Korean threat.

But a Navy photograph posted online showed the Carl Vinson near Indonesia, where it was conducting exercises with the Royal Australian Navy.

Spicer: The decision to fire Comey ""was all him,"" referring to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. ""No one from the White House. That was a DOJ decision.""

But two days later, Trump said, ""I was going to fire — my decision. ... I was going to fire, regardless of (Rosenstein's) recommendation.""

9,3 things you missed in the Warriors' comeback Game 1 win over Spurs | FOX Sports,"The Spurs have a huge advantage at the head coaching position

Steve Kerr was back in the building for the Warriors on Sunday, but as long as Mike Brown is the one making the in-game calls on the sidelines, the Spurs are going to have an enormous advantage where the two head coaches are concerned.

Gregg Popovich used a masterful game plan to stun the Warriors in the first half, slowing the pace to keep Golden State from getting out in transition, and staying out on the shooters to force them into taking more-difficult-than-usual shots. The Warriors finished the first quarter with as many field goals as turnovers (6), and missed all four of their three-point attempts while shooting 28.6 percent from the field in the game's first 12 minutes.

Popovich also made sure to engage LaMarcus Aldridge from the jump by getting him plenty of offensive touches. More on him later, but the Spurs know they can't afford to have him disappear for multiple games in this series the way he did against the Rockets, and he had 14 points on 5-of-7 shooting as San Antonio went up by 14 points at the end of the first quarter.",fox-sports

9,Si Woo Kim wins Players Championship with bogey-free final round | FOX Sports,"21-year-old Si Woo Kim became the youngest player to ever win the Players Championship Sunday at TPC Sawgrass, avoiding the potential disasters that can occur at nearly any hole down the stretch with a bogey-free round of 69. Kim was the only player in the top-10 to card zero bogeys on the day, while the final group pairing of J.B. Holmes and Kyle Stanley finished a combined 13-over par on the day.

Kim was 3-under through his first nine holes Sunday, and no one was able to catch him at 10-under par. Ian Poulter – who thought he had lost his PGA Tour card a few weeks ago before the FedEx Cup points were recalculated and he retained his status – was within a shot of Kim’s lead with seven holes to play, but bogeys at 12 and 18 dashed his hopes.

9,Rafa Cabrera Bello makes ultra-rare albatross at Players Championship | FOX Sports,"Aces on par-3s are impressive, but the rarest shot in golf is the albatross – a double-eagle 2 on a par-5.

There had been only two recorded albatrosses in the history of The Players Championship until Sunday, when Rafael Cabrera Bello went 523 yards in two shots at the par-5 16th hole. He had 180 yards left for his approach shot with an iron, and Cabrera Bello bounced the ball through a collection area and across the green, where it raced into the flagstick and dropped into the cup.

The shot instantly turned around what had been a frustrating round for Cabrera Bello, who started the day in a tie for 10th but was 2-over par through his first 15 holes.

9,7 takeaways from the LA Galaxy's convincing 3-1 win over the New York Red Bulls | FOX Sports,"Last week, Galaxy coach Curt Onalfo took a huge risk: He took captain and centerback Jelle Van Damme off in the middle of the first half. It wasn't without warrant, both goals that the Chicago Fire scored in the first half could be traced to Van Damme's sloppiness, but the Galaxy had their share of other problems. Either way, the decision worked and the Galaxy came roaring back.

So the question was whether Van Damme would start in the Galaxy's next game in New York. Surprisingly or not, he did start, after Onalfo clearly thought Van Damme had a good week of training to think things over. Van Damme played well for the Galaxy on Sunday – he had a batch of interceptions and recoveries and he was a menace on set pieces. It was a good shift from one of the Galaxy's Designated Players and he was one of the best players on the field.",fox-sports
3,Comey sacking: Trump urged to hand over any tapes,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption President Trump abruptly fired James Comey as FBI director last week

Senior US lawmakers have called on President Donald Trump to turn over any recordings of conversations with fired FBI director James Comey.

Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer warned that destroying any tapes would break the law.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the White House needed to ""clear the air"" about whether tapes existed.

The comments come after Mr Trump tweeted what appeared to be a thinly veiled threat to the former FBI chief.

He warned Mr Comey last week against talking to the media, saying he had ""better hope there are no tapes"" of their conversations.

The White House has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of any tapes.

Mr Schumer also warned that Senate Democrats might refuse to vote on a new FBI director until a special prosecutor is named to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the US election.

The FBI is investigating the allegations and possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign.

Mr Trump denies any such links and says Mr Comey had assured him he was not being investigated. He says he fired Mr Comey because he was not doing a good job.

Democrats, however, have accused President Trump of firing Mr Comey to try to thwart the FBI inquiry.

Mr Schumer told CNN that if any tapes existed ""the president should turn them over immediately. To destroy them would be a violation of law"".

""If there are no tapes, he should apologise to both Jim Comey and the American people for misleading them,"" he added.

Senator Graham told NBC that Mr Trump's tweet was ""inappropriate"" and called on the president to ""back off and let the investigation go forward"".

""You can't be cute about tapes,"" he said. ""If there are any tapes of this conversation, they need to be turned over.""

Meanwhile, President Trump has said he could announce a replacement for Mr Comey later this week.

Those under consideration include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia, Republican Senator John Cornyn and senior lawyer Alice Fisher.",bbc-news
16,Worldwide cyberattack could spark more trouble Monday,"Companies worldwide are bracing for even more fallout from the biggest cyberattack ever as their workers head back to the office Monday.

The massive ransomware attacks that started late Friday have locked people out of their computers and demanded hundreds of dollars from the users before they could regain control.

The attacks exploit a vulnerability in outdated versions of Microsoft Windows that is particularly problematic for corporations that don't automatically update their systems.

Related: A super-simple explanation of what happened

The virus has hit at least 150 countries and claimed 200,000 victims, according to the European Union's law enforcement agency Europol. Hospitals, universities, manufacturers and government agencies in the U.K., China, Russia, Germany and Spain have all been affected.

And experts say the scope of the problem could expand as people return to work and fire up their computers.

There are several factors in play. While a U.K. security researcher managed to stop the spread of the virus, hackers have issued new versions that cybersecurity organizations are trying to counter and stamp out.

""We will get a decryption tool eventually, but for the moment, it's still a live threat and we're still in disaster recovery mode,"" Europol director Rob Wainwright told CNN's Becky Anderson on Sunday.

He added that the agency is still analyzing the virus and has yet to identify who is responsible for the attack.

At least one strain of the ransomware has proven especially vicious. Once it infects one computer within a network, it can spread to all the computers in that network ""within seconds,"" said Israel Levy, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm Bufferzone.

For example, if one of your coworkers opens an infected PDF attached to an email, soon everyone in your office could be under attack.

In the world of ransomware, that was ""unheard of six months ago,"" Levy said. The attacks used to only be able to target one machine at a time.

Related: World's biggest cyberattack sends countries into 'disaster recovery mode'

Officials say they're aware of those problems.

""It is important to understand that the way these attacks work means that compromises of machines and networks that have already occurred may not yet have been detected, and that existing infections from the malware can spread within networks,"" said the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre in a statement Sunday.

That's why companies are anxious to beef up security or combat potential infections, according to Aviv Grafi, the chief technology officer of Votiro, another cybersecurity firm.

Grafi said his firm has been contacted by companies that are scrambling to avoid potential pitfalls.

The list of institutions affected is expected to grow as more become aware of hacks or if more variants spread infections.

Global Companies

FedEx: The company said it was ""experiencing interference with some of our Windows-based systems caused by malware"" and was trying to fix the problems as quickly as possible.

Nissan: The carmaker said in a statement that ""some Nissan entities were recently targeted"" but ""there has been no major impact on our business.""

China

Colleges: Internet security firm Qihoo360 issued a ""red alert"" over the weekend, saying a large number of colleges and students in China had been hit by the ransomware attack.

Gas stations: State-run media in China reported that some gas stations saw their digital payment systems shut down, forcing customers to bring cash.

Germany

Deutsche Bahn: The German railway company told CNNMoney that due to the attack ""passenger information displays in some stations were inoperative"" as were ""some ticket machines.""

Russia

Russian Central Bank: State media agency Tass reported the bank discovered malware bulk emails to banks but detected no compromise of resources. The central bank reportedly said those monitoring the cyberattacks found ""no incidents compromising data resources of banking institutions.""

Russian Railways: State media said a virus attacked the IT system of Russian Railways, but it did not affect operations due to a prompt response. The company said the virus has been localized and ""technical work is underway to destroy it and update the antivirus protection.""

Interior Ministry: The Russian Interior Ministry acknowledged a ransomware attack on its computers, adding that less than 1% of computers were affected. The statement said antivirus systems are working to destroy it.

Megafon: A spokesperson for Russian telecommunications company Megafon told CNN that the cyberattack affected call centers but not the company's networks. He said the situation was under control.

Spain

Telefónica: Spanish authorities confirmed the Spanish telecom company Telefónica (TEF) was one of the targets, though the attack affected only some computers and did not compromise the security of clients' information.

United Kingdom

National Health Service: At least sixteen NHS organizations have been hit, according to NHS Digital. ""At this stage, we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected (organizations) to confirm this,"" the agency said. The NHS has said hospitals have had to cancel some outpatient appointments because of the attack.

OAKLAND – The Golden State Warriors survived Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, roaring back from a 25-point deficit for a 113-111 victory over the San Antonio Spurs at Oracle Arena on Sunday.

It was an admirable show, to be sure, but one made possible by yet another injury to Spurs star Kawhi Leonard. The Warriors looked beat early in the third quarter, when Leonard buried two free throws to push the Spurs’ lead to 78-55 and the locals in this ear-splitting venue were as quiet as you’ll ever hear. But there was a catch, and a monumental one at that.

Leonard had tweaked his ailing left ankle on the left corner jumpshot attempt that earned him the trip to the line, landing on the right foot of Warriors center Zaza Pachulia as he attempted to close. Leonard headed to the locker room for good shortly thereafter. It was the second time in a matter of minutes that Leonard appeared to re-injure the same ankle that kept him out of the late stages of Game 5 and all of Game 6 against the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals.

Here's the play Kawhi hurt his ankle #Spurs#Warriorspic.twitter.com/xqaSJ0RkK4 — Jabari Young (@JabariJYoung) May 14, 2017

Just three minutes and nine seconds later, courtesy of an 18-0 run that cut San Antonio’s lead to five, the Warriors were back in business.

""We need Kawhi to create, to score,"" Spurs guard Manu Ginobili said. ""He means a lot to this team. We were doing really well. When he went down, the Warriors were starting to pick up, to feel good about themselves, to increase the pressure on everybody else, and that's when we struggled because we couldn't have the guy that runs those plays and get them off their pressure. We struggled a lot without him and it's a tough break.""

Leonard said afterward that he was unsure if he’d play in Game 2 on Tuesday.

“We’ll see tomorrow and the next day to see how I’m feeling,” he said.

Golden State didn’t earn its first lead until midway through the fourth quarter, when Kevin Durant’s pullup jumper fell through and the Warriors (98-95) were on their way. Durant was key in the fourth quarter, scoring 12 of his 34 points. Warriors point guard Stephen Curry had just four points after the first quarter, but finished with a game-high 40 points. Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge had a team-high 28 points, but just six came in the final period in which San Antonio shot 33.3% (seven of 21).

""(The Warriors are) a great team. They're talented, they're well coached, they're hungry,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ""They made great runs, we made too many mistakes. To play a team like that, you can't make the mistakes we made.""

The Warriors received a welcome surprise on the coaching front, as the ailing Steve Kerr was part of team meetings in the locker room before, during, and after the game while watching from the locker room. Kerr, who last coached in Game 2 of the first round against Portland on April 19 because of complications suffered from back surgery two summers ago, did not make the trip to Utah for the Warriors’ last two playoffs games in the second round.

And this wasn’t a token appearance, either, as he addressed his players at halftime before yielding to acting head coach Mike Brown.

""Get your poise back,” Kerr told them, as seen on locker room cameras that were used for the ABC telecast. “Wings, run like crazy, just settle a little (and) get three stops in a row. Let’s get three stops in a row, and then the push will come from that. The pace will come from that. Settle in. We’ll be alright.”

At halftime, Steve Kerr spoke with the @warriors on #NBAonABCpic.twitter.com/q9CNXSGOfd — NBA (@NBA) May 14, 2017

After a postseason that had been roundly accused of being boring, the Spurs delivered a compelling start by jumping out to a 30-16 lead after the first quarter and leading 62-42 at halftime. Aldridge led the way on the offensive end, attacking everyone from Durant to Draymond Green to Andre Iguodala while scoring 18 first-half points.

One-legged stepback jumpers. Hard drives through the hole. Aldridge, whose 34-point outing in the closeout game against Houston helped bury James Harden & Co., set a strong tone early with his versatile array of looks. Leonard took over in the second quarter, scoring 14 of his 18 first-half points while hitting all six of his free throws.

But more than anything, it was the Spurs’ vaunted defense that had Golden State in unfamiliar territory. Not only did the Warriors shoot just 13 of 38 in the first half (34.2%), with Thompson missing five of six shots and Green turning in an out-of-character minus-20 mark that was the Warriors’ worst, but they fell prey to the sort of sloppiness that was nowhere to be found in their first two rounds.

There were 10 first-half turnovers in all, this after they averaged just 11.5 per game in series victories against Portland and Utah (second-best ranking among playoff teams). During the regular season, the Warriors ranked 22nd in the NBA in turnovers per game (14.8). And as if the sheer quantity of the giveaways wasn’t bad enough, their timing was even tougher.

After the Warriors cut the Spurs’ lead from 25 to 14 in the second quarter, a Curry flurry in which he hit Golden State’s first three-pointer of the game at the 5:05 mark to cap a 13-2 run, the blunders ensued. Curry drove from the right side and found himself stuck in traffic on the baseline, only to swing a hook-shot pass to the perimeter that was picked off by Patty Mills. Leonard converted on the other end, navigating through bodies in the lane en route to a three-point play that pushed the lead back to 20. Time and again, with the Spurs’ defensive pressure omnipresent, the Warriors would miss their small window of opportunity — at least in the first half.

3,North Korea missile test was 'new type of ballistic rocket',"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption North Korea displayed its missile arsenal in a massive military parade in April

North Korea has claimed that the missile it tested on Sunday was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead.

The missile, launched at a steep angle, reached an altitude of 2,000km (1,242 miles) and travelled about 700km, landing in the sea west of Japan.

North Korea said on Monday it was a test of the abilities of a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"".

The test, yet another breach of UN sanctions, was roundly condemned.

Repeated missile tests by the North this year - not all of them successful - have sparked international alarm and raised tensions with the US.

The US and Japan have called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

North Korea's KCNA state news agency said on Monday that the test of a ""newly developed mid/long-range strategic ballistic rocket, Hwasong-12"" had gone to plan.

""The test-fire aimed at verifying the tactical and technological specifications of the newly developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead,"" it said.

North Korea is known to be developing both nuclear weapons - it has conducted five nuclear tests - and the missiles capable of delivering those weapons to their target. Both are in defiance of UN sanctions.

But it remains unclear whether it has the ability to make the weapons small enough to be mounted on a rocket, and it has never tested a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which could reach, for example, the US.

ICBM's are considered to have a range of about 6,000km, but analysts believe the missile tested on Sunday would have travelled about 4,000km if it had been fired at a standard trajectory rather than upwards.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""You can feel the ground shake"" reports John Sudworth as he watches soldiers, tanks and rockets pass

The KCNA report said that, as ever, the test had been overseen by the North's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un.

It said he had told the scientists and technicians involved ""not to be complacent"" but to build further ""nuclear weapons and methods of delivery"" until the US made ""the right choice"".

The White House has mooted talks with North Korea under the right conditions, which would include a halt in missile tests.

But in a statement on Sunday, it said Pyongyang had been ""a flagrant menace for far too long"" and that this ""latest provocation"" should ""serve as a call for all nations to implement far stronger sanctions"".

The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said on Sunday that until Mr Kim meets the US conditions, ""we're not sitting down with him"".

South Korea's newly elected President Moon Jae-in, who is seeking deeper engagement with the North, said it was a ""reckless provocation"" while China, North Korea's only real ally, is urging restraint.",bbc-news

With Jermaine Jones injured and looking increasingly ineffective, there just might be an opening for Acosta to grab.

He now has six goals across all competitions for FC Dallas this season, but it's his defensive work rate and his ability on both sides of the ball that makes his an appealing player.",fox-sports
9,Warriors' Andre Iguodala could miss Game 2 vs. Spurs with a knee injury | FOX Sports,"Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala didn’t play at all in the second half of his team’s wild 113-111 come-from-behind win over the Spurs on Sunday, and it was initially believed that it was simply a result of acting head coach Mike Brown’s quirky lineup decisions. Iguodala had averaged more than 28 minutes per game in the playoffs heading into the matchup, and Brown only said afterward that his player looking “hobbled” in the first half was what led to his decision.

But Iguodala said he’s set for an MRI on Monday to determine the severity of what the team is calling left knee soreness, and also mentioned that the team’s trainers were the ones during the game who told him he was out.

Even if the results of the test come back clean, Marcus Thompson of the Mercury News is reporting that “there is a strong chance Iguodala will be held out for rest and treatment just as a precaution.”

The Spurs, of course, are dealing with a far more important injury. Kawhi Leonard left Game 1 after re-injuring his ankle, and a 23-point Spurs lead immediately was cut to just five after the Warriors went on an 18-0 run the moment Leonard headed to the locker room for the remainder of the contest.",fox-sports
16,Miss USA 2017: Miss D.C. Kára McCullough wins the crown,"The winner of Miss USA 2017 is Miss D.C. Kara McCullough. (Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images)

For the second year in a row, the Miss USA crown went to the District of Columbia.

Miss D.C. Kára McCullough became the 66th Miss USA during Sunday night's pageant, with Miss New Jersey Chhavi Verg named the runner-up and Miss Minnesota Meridith Gould the second runner-up.

As she joked earlier in the competition, McCullough hoped to win the crown to give D.C. ""back to back"" wins ""like Drake."" Miss D.C. 2016 Deshauna Barber won the competition last year.

Among the top five — Minnesota, Illinois, South Carolina, New Jersey and District of Columbia — four were women of color, which didn't go unnoticed, with social media celebrating the #blackgirlmagic on the Miss USA stage. The contestants' diverse backgrounds included Miss D.C.'s work as a nuclear scientist and Miss Illinois's guest role on Fox's Empire and position dancing for the Chicago Bulls.



The Miss Universe organization has worked to incorporate women's empowerment into their pageants in the years since its split with its former owner, President Trump. For their last question, District of Columbia, New Jersey and Minnesota were all asked about their definitions of feminism. Their answers touched on the fight for equality, with McCullough saying she wouldn’t call herself a feminist, but an “equalist,""in her winning answer.

Other political topics popped up throughout Sunday night's competition, featuring voice-overs where contestants talked about issues including student loan debt and the American Dream, and a taped segment featuring the participants discussing the White House's proposed travel ban and the administration’s stance on immigrants.

While its sister competition Miss Teen USA replaced its swimsuit portion with athleisure outfits, Miss USA hasn’t made that leap. But the swimwear seen on the contestants showed a greater range of styles than the once-dominant bikinis, with several women wearing one-pieces, jackets and suits with sleeves.

One change the competition did make was in its Q&A portion, which featured user-submitted questions in partnership with the Skimm, instead of the usual pre-scripted prompts. In an interview before the competition, co-host Julianne Hough said she hoped the new format would help the women navigate through tough, politically-oriented questions. “I'm just hoping with the questions, instead of trying to stump someone, (the Q&A) gives them an opportunity to have a voice,” she said. With topics including women in the workplace, healthcare and America’s place on the global stage, the Q&A hinted at social issues without venturing into more controversial issues, and the five contestants all emerged flub-free.

4,My Mama’s Manicures Taught Me How To Take Care Of Myself,"For a long time, I didn’t want to be “my mother’s daughter.” But it turns out that, at least when it comes to getting our nails done, I am.

My mother likes to shine. From her glossy lips to her leopard-print leggings, she gives you something to admire. And for as long as I can remember, my mother has kept an impeccable manicure. A twinkling top coat is not enough; her polishes are frosted, sometimes glittery. She doesn’t get wild with designs very often, but does match with the holidays: bold red for Valentine’s Day, shimmering pink for Easter, burnished orange for Thanksgiving, sparkling gold for New Year’s. The only times I’ve ever seen her with ragged cuticles or no polish at all were when she was suffering from a bad case of her “nerves,” anxiety attacks that caused her to pick at her fingers until her tough, shiny veneer lay in fragments in her lap.

Mama raised three children on the meager salary of a licensed practical nurse, but always made sure to treat herself to the luxury of a manicure. In today’s language, it was her form of self-care, a way of making sure she provided for herself as she took care of everyone else. I recognize this act of self-care everywhere I go in the hands of grocery store clerks, fast-food workers, teachers — people who may not be wealthy, but want to give themselves a small, affordable treat. My mom’s nails were also one of the ways she expressed her femininity, and for years I resented the idea that I had to prove my gender through such superficial markers. But as I get older, I find myself turning to nail salons in the same way she always has. Much to my mother’s chagrin, I wasn’t a very girly girl. I hated the color pink and refused to wear the flower-print dresses she tried to steer me toward whenever we went shopping together. Mama was raised by her grandmother, and subscribed to the notion that “women should look like women.” That meant Mama didn’t leave the house without earrings, lipstick, some kind of bracelet, her hair perfect in whatever style it was. To this day, Mama still wears slips, even under denim skirts. “They make your clothes hang better,” she’ll explain. When I need her help looking for a formal gown for an event, she’ll ask me if I’m going to wear stockings. She doesn’t hide her disappointment well when I say no. When I was younger, I bit my nails, often down to the quick. I’d get anxious about homework or become too involved in the book I was reading, and I’d chew to the point of pain. I rarely painted my nails, because I didn’t want to bring attention to my fingers. It was in the mid-’80s, when I was around 9 years old, that I started to pay attention to my mother’s nails. For a while, she’d get manicures at a local beauty school, which was considerably cheaper than going to a shop. It might have been more practical for her to keep her nails short, because she was a nurse, but she always had a bit of length to them — her own small rebellion against her job. I remember smoothing my fingers over Mama’s nails, feeling the strength of the acrylic overlay. I liked the way they looked, even if I didn’t want them for myself yet.

I also remember marveling at the Olympic track star Florence Griffith Joyner (aka Flo Jo) and her nails. Flo Jo was the first non-superhero I wanted to be. I didn’t hang up celebrity posters in my bedroom, but I had a picture of her, ripped from one of my father’s Sports Illustrated magazines, in my Trapper Keeper. Not only was she one of the fastest track stars of the time, but she raced with a full face of makeup, flowing extensions in her hair, and had incredible, outlandish nails — none of which stopped her from competing, and winning. Flo Jo and my mom attracted attention with their manicures in a way that seemed foreign to me, an introverted girl who always carried a book to avoid conversations. I envied their ability to be bold. For a long time, I didn’t want to be “my mother’s daughter.” I resented it when people said we looked and acted alike; I wanted to be my own person, not a copy of her. Mama still loves dresses and skirts. I still prefer jeans and T-shirts. And yet, over the years, I’ve found myself drawn to the same types of flashy jewelry. One day, I looked up and I too had a closet full of purses and shoes. And when I became an adult and started working at jobs that left me emotionally and spiritually drained, I found myself turning toward nail salons to treat myself. Mama has a standing appointment, every payday, to get her nails done — her way of feeling like her money goes to something other than just paying bills. I’ve started doing the same.

I grew up watching my mother go to hair and nail salons, gossip with whoever was working on her, and let go of her job and all its worries. I don’t like to talk as much as she does, but I like the routine of going to see someone I know will try their best to make sure I look and feel good. Co-workers and supervisors don’t care much about that. Warm, damp towels around my hands or feet can make me forget about my anxieties for at least 10 minutes, or however long it takes for them to cool. When I’m picking out a color, one of my deciding factors is often if my mother would like my choice. And if I glance too quickly at myself in the mirror, I see Mama instead. When I can, I treat my mother to a pedicure. My aunt, my mother’s sister, is a manicurist, and she’s been taking care of my mother’s nails for almost two decades, but Mama rarely gets her toes done. So I’ll take Mama with me to my nail salon. She likes it when the nail technicians pretend to be surprised that she has a daughter my age. She always falls asleep in the massage chair, sighing as it works the tense muscles in her back loose. “When you get rich,” she tells me when she wakes from her nap, “you have to get me one of these chairs.”",buzzfeed

You got: You belong in Seattle, Washington You're a little counter culture-ish, but not in an annoying, just-for-the-sake-of-it way. You're just extra conscious of the environment around you, and love packing your weekends with hikes and fresh-from-the-farm (and -pan), umami-rich foods. Sure, it might rain nine months out of the year in the Pacific Northwest, but ""cozy"" is your favorite aesthetic, anyway. Flickr / Wonderlane

You got: You belong in Los Angeles, California There are few things you enjoy more in life than a lazy, commitment-free Sunday afternoon spent lounging with your friends, drinking an ice cold beer, and chowing down on a platter of street tacos. I mean, it's the least you can do after a long week of work, Instagram posting, and yet another failed Tinder date (why do you always get stuck with the egocentric duds?!). Some people may hate on you (and LA!) for being superficial, but what can you say? You really did wake up like that. Getty Images

You got: You belong in Atlanta, Georgia You're a group-oriented person who thrives in crowds and has the most fun in large company. It's not that you're the most outgoing person in the world, you just love people — whether it's deep conversations with your significant other, eating out at that trendy new pie spot with friends, or simply lounging on a sofa scrolling through your feeds together. When you do find time to yourself, you like to keep busy, either trying out that new avocado brownie recipe, or going out shopping. Your friends are great, but only YOU know how to treat yo-self.

You have little regard for what's cool or popular, though your natural preferences always somehow happen to be on-trend. And though you love trying out new foods, you'll always prefer the simple pleasure of an ice-cold beer and a basket of french fries to any fancy unicorn drink. Getty Images
