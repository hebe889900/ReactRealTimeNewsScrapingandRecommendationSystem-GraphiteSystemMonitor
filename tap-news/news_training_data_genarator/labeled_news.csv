6,Sources: Comey wrote in memo that Trump asked to end Flynn investigation,"The memo is the clearest sign yet of potential interference by Trump with the investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russian officials.

""Three words: obstruction of justice,"" said CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on Tuesday. ""Telling the FBI director to close down an investigation of your senior campaign adviser for his activities during your campaign for president, if that's true, that is obstruction of justice.""

"" 'Close it down' is an instruction to stop investigating President Trump's campaign. Richard Nixon was impeached in 1974 for telling the FBI to stop an investigation of his campaign. That's what Watergate was,"" Toobin added. ""If (Comey's) telling the truth, I don't know how anyone can see this comment as anything but obstruction of justice.""

Writing the memo was ""not out of character,"" especially if he was concerned about the legality or moral issues, according to a former Justice Department official.

Multiple White House officials refuted the claim on Tuesday, including one who said a ""conversation of that nature"" did not happen.

""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" a White House official said in a statement. ""The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.""

'A number of memos'

Comey was in the Oval Office briefing the President along with the vice president and attorney general on February 14, according to a source close to Comey who has a copy of the memo. After the briefing, Trump ""asked Sessions and Pence to leave,"" the source told CNN.

According to a memo, Comey wrote about the encounter and shared with confidantes, the President said: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.""

He told Comey that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong.

Comey was ""concerned"" that the President was trying to ""stop the investigation,"" the source told CNN. ""He wrote a number of memos, a great many if not all were about contacts with Trump -- particularly the ones that made him feel uneasy.""

The source did not know how many memos Comey had written.

The source said that Comey hopes the President's threats about ""tapes"" of their conversations indicate there are actually recordings of their conversations.

""He would love to have them,"" the source said. ""One of his reasons for writing these memos is the concern this couldn't be corroborated -- but that could be met if there are tapes.""

Loyalty to Flynn

Trump has looked to stay loyal to Flynn, despite the fact that he fired his top national security aide in February after it became clear that he did not properly disclose the nature of conversations he had with Russian officials.

Trump, in a series of public comments and interviews, has suggested that Flynn was being mistreated and has heralded him as a good man.

""Gen. Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases,"" Trump said in February. ""And I think it is really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.""

McCabe testimony: FBI investigations unimpeded by Comey firing

In Senate testimony last Thursday , acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told lawmakers that despite Comey's firing, there had been ""no effort"" to impede the FBI's ongoing investigations.

During an intelligence committee hearing, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, asked: ""Mr. McCabe, can you, without going into specifics of any individual investigation, I think the American people want to know, has the dismissal of Mr. Comey in any way impeded, interrupted, stopped or negatively impacted any of the work of any investigation or any ongoing projects at the Federal Bureau of Investigations?""

McCabe, who was filling in for Comey, responded: ""As you know senator, the work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstance, any decisions, so there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date. Simply put, sir, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.""

Lawmakers want to hear from Comey

Reaction from Capitol Hill was swift, with Republicans and Democrats alike demanding answers from Comey.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Tuesday that the former FBI director should testify before Congress about his conversation with Trump.

And Sen. Dianne Feinstein told reporters that she ""absolutely"" thinks Comey should testify before the full Senate Judiciary Committee on the conversation.

""I believe we should begin to hold hearing as a full committee on this,"" she said.",cnn

Flynn was a national security director until his ouster less than month into Trump's term

Washington (CNN) CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Tuesday if President Donald Trump told the FBI to end a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, then it would amount to obstruction of justice.

The New York Times first reported Tuesday that former FBI Director James Comey wrote a memo about Trump telling him that Flynn ""is a good guy"" and the FBI should drop an investigation into Flynn, citing sources who had read the memo. Sources also confirmed the contents of the memo to CNN 's Pamela Brown and Jake Tapper.

""Telling the FBI director to close down an investigation of your senior campaign adviser for his activities during your campaign for president, if that's true, that is obstruction of justice,"" Toobin said on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.""

Toobin said that if Comey's memo was accurate: ""I don't know how anyone can see this comment as anything but obstruction of justice.""

He also likened the move to the scandal that brought down former President Richard Nixon.

6,Chaffetz: I'm ready to subpoena for Comey memo,"(CNN) House oversight committee chairman Jason Chaffetz said Tuesday that if a memo FBI Director James Comey wrote detailing President Donald Trump's request to end an investigation exists, then his committee is willing to issue subpoenas to get it.

"".@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready,"" Chaffetz tweeted.

President Donald Trump asked Comey to end his investigation of Michael Flynn one day after he fired him, according to a memo written by Comey detailing their discussion. The New York Times first reported the memo Tuesday and a source familiar with the matter confirmed the contents of the memo to CNN.

A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan showed support for Chaffetz's push.

""We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo,"" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement.

The head of the Republican Study Committee, Rep. Mark Walker, said that if the report is true, then it's concerning to him.

""If that's accurate, I'm hearing that it's not -- to say that we would have some concern would be accurate, that would be troubling,"" Walker told CNN. ""To act like it's not a concern would be remiss on my part.""

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican, also said the report raises questions.

""I think it's really important right now that we hear from the White House,"" she told CNN. ""I think the White House needs to be open and transparent about whats going on, too. And I hope that we can get Comey to come up here and testify.""

Leaders of the congressional investigations into Russian meddling into the US election last year are also calling on Comey to testify.

The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, also called on Comey to testify before his panel.

""Enough is enough, Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this,"" Schiff said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of a judiciary subcommittee investigating Russia, said that Comey should testify before his Senate panel about his discussions with Trump over Flynn, who resigned earlier this year.

Comey had already been invited to testify before the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday about his firing a week ago, but he declined the invitation.

""OK, well, he's got to come in and tell us why,"" Graham said. ""We're not going to try somebody on a piece of paper.""

Graham also said he would consider a special prosecutor if Comey's recounting of the meeting was accurate.

""If I thought there was inappropriate behavior by the President, sure,"" Graham said.

Meanwhile, Democratic leaders quickly described the actions Comey depicted in a memo as ""obstruction of justice.""

""If these reports are true, the President's brazen attempt to shut down the FBI's investigation of Michael Flynn is an assault on the rule of law that is fundamental to our democracy,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

6,Did H.R. McMaster just make Donald Trump's Russia problems worse?,"(CNN) National Security Advise r H.R. McMaster faced the press Tuesday afternoon in hopes of quieting the storm caused by a Washington Post report that the president had shared classified information with two top Russian officials during a visit to the Oval Office last week.

He might have made things worse.

Asked a direct question as to whether Trump discussed classified information with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kisylak, McMaster dodged.

""We don't say what's classified and what's not classified,"" he said. ""What the president shared was wholly appropriate.""

JUST WATCHED McMaster: Trump unaware of intel source Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McMaster: Trump unaware of intel source 00:54

Er, what?

The defense of Trump is that he didn't really know the source of the report and, therefore, couldn't have possibly told the Russians more than he should? The opposite end of that defense is this: Trump was talking to two top officials of an adversarial power about highly protected information without having been briefed fully on that information.

Which creates this choice: Either Trump was talking about a topic he knew about -- and knew he needed to be careful as to what he could say -- or he was freelancing with a piece of information he didn't really know the full story on.

For his part, Trump offered little clarity on the meeting although he did nothing to dispute the basic facts reported by the Post and CNN among others.

""We had a very successful meeting with the foreign minister of Russia,"" Trump said at an appearance with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Tuesday afternoon. Trump added: ""We had a great meeting with the foreign ministers. We're going to have a lot of great success over the next coming years.""

Well that's that then!

Much like what happened last week with the aftermath of the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the White House's inability to stick to a single story regarding what Trump actually told (or didn't tell) the Russians is making the situation far worse.

If Trump hadn't been fully briefed on the information and its source, then why was he talking about it in the Oval Office with a country that has been a bad actor on the world stage -- and that we know actively worked to sway the 2016 election?

McMaster is, without question, one of the Trump advisers given the widest berth by Democratic and Republican members of Congress. In the wake of his comments on Tuesday afternoon, several Republican senators made clear that he had their trust.

""I take General McMaster at his word,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain told CNN's Jeremy Herb

Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe echoed that sentiment in a conversation with Herb. ""I think McMaster is right,"" said Inhofe. ""He's never been wrong before. He's had a distinguished career, he knows the situation, he was there. I tend to believe him as opposed to some anonymous.""

But McMaster's explanation of what Trump knew and what he said neither disputes the Post and CNN reporting nor makes it totally obvious that Trump knew what he was talking about with Lavrov and Kisylak.

In short: McMaster's attempt to put this fire out managed to only spray more lighter fluid on it.",cnn
6,Yates: Russians had 'real leverage' over Flynn,"Responding to a question from Cooper on whether she agreed with the White House line that Flynn was dismissed over a ""trust issue"" rather than a legal one, she said, ""I don't know how the White House reached the conclusion that there was no legal issue. It certainly wasn't from my discussion with them.""

She demurs on whether she thought that his contact with Russian officials was a fireable offense.

""Whether he is fired or not is a decision by the President of the United States to make, but it doesn't seem like that's a person who should be sitting in the national security adviser position,"" she said.

Urgency

Yates told Cooper that she expected the White House to act urgently on information that she had given the administration that Flynn had been compromised by his contact with Russian officials prior to Trump's inauguration.

""We expected the White House to act,"" she said.

When asked by Cooper if she expected the administration to act quickly, Yates replied, ""Yes.""

""There was an urgency to the information?"" Cooper clarified.

""Yes,"" Yates said.

Flynn remained in his position for 18 days after Yates had informed the administration about her concerns over his conduct.

Let go

Yates, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, was fired as acting attorney general at the end of January when she refused to defend the President's first attempt at a ban on travelers and refugees entering the US from a number of Muslim-majority countries.

She was dismissed for ""refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,"" the White House said at the time.

""(Yates) has betrayed the Department of Justice,"" the White House statement said.

Yates also denies that she was behind the leaking of a story to The Washington Post about Flynn's calls with Kislyak , which led to his dismissal.

""Absolutely not. I did not and I would not leak classified information,"" she told Cooper.

She said that she was ""concerned"" that her information appeared not to be acted upon, but concedes that ""something else"" might have been done ""that maybe I just wasn't aware of.""

Asked what she thought of a tweet from Trump ahead of her appearance before the Senate committee, seemingly accusing her of leaking the story to the Post, she said that it was just one of ""a number of tweets that have given me pause.""",cnn

3,Trump 'asked FBI to halt Flynn inquiry',"Image copyright Reuters

President Donald Trump asked FBI chief James Comey to end an inquiry into links between his ex-national security adviser and Russia, US media report.

""I hope you can let this go,"" Mr Trump reportedly told Mr Comey after a White House meeting in February, according to a memo written by the ex-FBI director.

The memo was written immediately after the meeting, a day after Michael Flynn resigned, according to US media.

The White House has denied the report in a statement.

""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" the statement read.

Mr Flynn was forced out in February after he misled the vice-president about his conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office.

The latest Russia twist, first reported by the New York Times, comes a week after Mr Trump fired Mr Comey over his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while at the State Department.

Mr Comey's dismissal sent shockwaves through Washington, with critics accusing the president of trying to thwart the FBI investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the US election and any Moscow ties to Trump associates.

What's the latest allegation?

Mr Comey reportedly wrote a memo following a meeting with the president on 14 February that revealed Mr Trump asked him to close an investigation into Mr Flynn's actions.

He reportedly shared the memo with top FBI associates.

""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,"" the president told Mr Comey, according to the memo. ""He is a good guy.

Mr Comey did not respond to his request, according to the memo, but responded: ""I agree he is a good guy.""

In response to the report, a White House official pointed out that acting FBI director Andrew McCabe testified last week that there ""has been no effort to impede our investigation to date"".

A storm is brewing - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

A person doesn't rise as high as James Comey did in the federal government without learning how to cover his, er, posterior.

With this latest bombshell from the New York Times it's clear that the former FBI director, who was unceremoniously sacked by the president, is poised to enjoy the last laugh.

At the moment the White House is denying Mr Comey's reported characterisation of the conversation the two men had shortly after the president fired Michael Flynn.

In a he-said, he-said situation, however, the man who wrote contemporaneous memos - and that is memos, plural - will have the upper hand.

Add in that Mr Comey has a reputation for independence, and the face-off looks even more ominous for the president.

As deputy attorney general Mr Comey stood up to the Bush administration during a showdown over the legality of government surveillance programme. He also withstood withering criticism from Democrats over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation last year.

If he swears to a congressional committee that the president put undue pressure on him to end an ongoing Flynn investigation, his word will pack a punch.

The White House better batten down the hatches. A storm is brewing.

Why was Flynn being investigated?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Flynn was fired for misleading colleagues

Mr Trump's early presidency has been overshadowed by a string of controversies regarding possible links to Russian interests.

Mr Flynn's departure in February came months after suspicions were raised among intelligence officials.

He resigned as White House national security adviser after just 23 days on the job over revelations that he discussed lifting sanctions on Moscow with Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump was sworn in.

Who is Michael Flynn?

It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy.

Since Mr Flynn stepped down, the Pentagon has launched an investigation into whether he failed to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists for speeches and consulting work.

Mr Flynn's Russian ties are under investigation by the FBI and and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider inquiries into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump.

Contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team are also under scrutiny.

Mr Comey's sacking on 9 May fuelled claims that Mr Trump may have been trying to cover up his associates' Moscow ties.

Did President Trump fire James Comey as part of a cover-up?

What is the reaction?

Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers were swift to question Mr Comey's memo following the report.

Republican Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, tweeted the panel would ""get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready"".

Top Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said he was ""shaken"" by the New York Times report.

""The country is being tested in unprecedented ways. I say to all of my colleagues in the Senate, history is watching,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Comey should testify about his discussions with the president.

Mr Comey declined an invitation to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee after his dismissal.

""OK, well, he's got to come in and tell us why,"" Mr Graham said following the report. ""We're not going to try somebody on a piece of paper.""",bbc-news

A pair of diamond earrings have been sold at auction in Geneva for a record-breaking price of $57.4m (£44.4m).

The pear-shaped jewels, nicknamed Apollo and Artemis, are almost 16 carats each.

The flawless stones mined in South Africa are perfectly matched except for their colour - Artemis is pink, and Apollo is blue.

Sotheby's chief auctioneer David Bennet said that coloured diamonds are extremely rare ""show stoppers"".

""These are in their own right extraordinarily rare stones, but taken together they are unprecedented, they are absolutely stunning,"" he said.

The earrings were bought by an anonymous buyer, media reports say, but will be kept as a pair.

Apollo and Artemis differ in one crucial area - their respective prices. Apollo sold for $42.5m while Artemis went for $15.5m.

The pure vivid blue of Apollo - from the Cullinan mine in South Africa - is rarer, and therefore worth more than the intense pink Artemis.

The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the earrings were the stars of Geneva's spring jewellery auction and Sotheby's initially offered them separately, after they wrongly assumed that a buyer with the wherewithal for both might actually be rarer than the diamonds themselves.

But the earrings sold some way below their estimated prices of $70m.",bbc-news
10,"iPad Mini 5: release date, news and rumors","Update: A recent rumor suggests that Apple may be killing off its Mini lineup, which would obviously dash plans for the iPad Mini 5. However, it's currently unconfirmed. We'll be sure to keep this space up to date with new details as they arrive.

Original article follows below.

The iPad Mini 4 launched more than a year ago, back in September 2015 in fact, so we’re long overdue a new model.

Despite that, rumors of the iPad Mini 5 (or iPad Pro Mini as it might be called) are thin on the ground. But with the expected March release having passed by, it's tough to tell when it will happen, or if it ever will.

In the meantime, we’re collecting all the news and rumors of what to expect, along with educated guesses based on what’s gone before.

Cut to the chase

What is it? Apple's next mini tablet

Apple's next mini tablet When is it out? Maybe March

Maybe March What will it cost? Probably at least $399/£379/AU$569

iPad Mini 5 release date

Hottest leaks:

A 2017 launch

A new name

There aren’t any iPad Mini 5 release date rumors yet, and with Apple’s tablet range typically getting updates in September or October we could have a while to wait.

Then again, Apple broke with tradition last year, and launched the iPad Pro 9.7 in March, which could mean we’ll see a March launch of one or more Apple tablets this year, and with the iPad Mini 4 already being over a year old that would seem more likely than waiting until the second half of the year.

But that’s if the iPad Mini 5 is coming at all. The reason it’s been so long since we’ve seen one could instead be because Apple’s killing the range off. After all, with 5.5-inch handsets like the iPhone 7 Plus there’s arguably less need for a 7.9-inch slate, and some rumors suggest that an iPad Mini 5 won’t be among Apple’s 2017 tablet line-up.

But there has been some talk of a new mini, or rather a 7.9-inch iPad Pro model, perhaps set to be called the iPad Pro Mini, so there is some hope.

And DigiTimes reported that Apple began production of its new slates (including a new iPad Mini) in December, suggesting a launch could happen in the next few months.

TechRadar’s take: We doubt Apple is done with the iPad Mini and expect to see a new model alongside the iPad Pro 2, though whether that will be in March or later in the year is less clear.

iPad Mini 5 design

Hottest leaks:

A 5mm thick build

A fingerprint scanner built into the screen

There aren’t many iPad Mini 5 design rumors, but there’s a good chance that it will have a lot in common with the iPad Mini 4, which basically means you can expect a slim metal shell.

Apple may aim to make it even slimmer and lighter than the 6.1mm thick and 299g iPad Mini 4 though, based on past form. There’s been some suggestion that Apple could even slim it down to just 5mm thick – though the source of this rumor is unclear, so we’d take it with a huge helping of salt.

Then again, it could get thicker, as Apple is rumored to be fattening up the iPad Pro 2, in order to ditch the home button and build the fingerprint scanner directly into the display.

There’s no mention of the iPad Mini 5 getting the same treatment, but with other sources suggesting it could be getting a Pro makeover it’s a possibility.

We may also see water and dust resistance added, given that Apple built the iPhone 7 to survive a splash, but arguably it’s a less useful feature on a tablet, so don’t count on it.

TechRadar’s take: We wouldn’t count on seeing the fingerprint scanner built into the screen. In fact, an overall similar design to the iPad Mini 4 is likely.

iPad Mini 5 screen

One thing we can be fairly confident of is that the iPad Mini 5 will have a 7.9-inch screen. Apple’s stuck with that resolution on all its mini slates and there’s no room for it to change much without encroaching on either the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus or the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 9.7.

It’s also likely to stay at a 1536 x 2048 resolution, given that even the larger and newer iPad Pro 9.7 has that resolution and that the iPad Mini 4’s screen is more than sharp enough.

Some things might change though, with True Tone for example being a likely addition. This automatically adjusts the color temperature of the screen depending on the ambient light and it’s a feature we’ve already seen on the iPad Pro 9.7.

Less likely but still possible is the addition of 3D Touch. That’s the pressure-sensitive tech that Apple’s packed into recent iPhones, but so far it’s been absent from the company’s tablets, and there’s no evidence that this will change with the iPad Mini 5.

iPad Mini 5 camera and battery

The iPad Mini 4 has an 8MP rear camera and a 1.2MP front-facing one, but Apple has moved on to a 12MP rear one and a 5MP front-facing one with the iPad Pro 9.7, so there’s every chance the iPad Mini 5 will match that, or even exceed it.

One possible if unlikely change is the addition of a second lens on the back, much like the iPhone 7 Plus, but with cameras being less vital to tablets we don’t expect that.

There’s no news on what size the battery will be. There’s a 5,124mAh one in the iPad Mini 4 and there’s a good chance Apple will stick with something similar, though if it further slims the slate down some battery size may be sacrificed.

iPad Mini 5 OS and power

Apple’s iPad Mini range doesn’t always have the most cutting edge chipsets, so while the iPad Pro 2 is rumored to be using the powerful A10X chip, the iPad Mini 5 may well stick with something slightly older, like the A10 Fusion from the iPhone 7 or the A9X from the iPad Pro 9.7.

And it may not get any improvement in RAM at all, as the iPad Mini 4 already has 2GB of the stuff – the same amount as the iPad Pro 9.7.

Assuming the iPad Mini 5 launches in the first half of the year it’s sure to run iOS 10, but if it doesn’t debut until the second half of the year it could run iOS 11.

iPad Mini 5 other features

There’s every chance we’ll see a range of new features on the iPad Mini 5, especially if it gets re-branded as the iPad Pro Mini.

We could for example get additional speakers for improved sound, much like the Pro range has, and a Smart Connector for attaching a keyboard. There’s also a good chance it will work with the Apple Pencil, making it more useful for digital artists.

As Apple has stuck a pressure-sensitive home button on the iPhone 7 (which vibrates rather than pushing in) there’s a good chance we’ll see that on the iPad Mini 5 as well – assuming the home button isn’t removed entirely.

iPad Mini 5 price

There aren’t any price rumors yet, but the iPad Mini 5 will likely cost at least as much as the Mini 4, meaning a starting price of around $399/£379/AU$569 for a 32GB version.",techradar

3. HP Laptop 15

Big specs, small cost

Lots of configuration options

Plenty of colors

Limited battery life

Hefty

There's some hefty grunt under the shell of this HP Laptop 15 and there are some great prices available as well. Even with the Intel Pentium processor and 4GB of RAM to start, this laptop will whip through pretty much any day-to-day activity you can throw at it without the juddering performance of even cheaper laptops. Hell, it'll even have a decent crack at playing a few of the less demanding games out there if you equip it with an Intel Core processor.

4. Acer Swift 3

Apple looks and feel for hundreds less

Intel Core i processors

Gorgeous, all-metal shell

Full HD screen

From afar, this laptop might be mistaken for a MacBook Air, which tells you a lot about its level of quality. Replete with an all-metal frame, this is probably one of the best-looking laptops for under 500 bucks. There are plenty of ports (old and new), 4GB of RAM and up to 512GB in solid-state storage. The cheapest models have a respectable Intel Core i3 processor, but you can get the more powerful i5 versions if you need that extra kick. Another dig at Apple? Unlike the Air, this laptop sports a fully HD screen.

The best deals on our favorite laptops

We've reviewed loads of laptops over the years: we've seen the good ones, the great ones and the ones to avoid. Sometimes, the best laptops pop up online at some truly deal-tastic prices. In this section, we list the very best laptops out there and the best deals on each one.

1. Dell XPS 13

Dell's latest Ultrabook is simply the best laptop in the world

CPU: Intel Core i3 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB | Screen: 13.3-inch QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) | Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD

Same long-lasting battery

Faster than ever

Still poor webcam position

No Windows Hello

The Dell XPS 13 is, bar none, the best laptop you can buy today. It features a revolutionary design that's astonishingly thin and light. Fitting a 13.3-inch screen into such a small frame means Dell has created a nearly borderless Infinity display. It's a powerful and long lasting machine even by today's Ultrabook standards. The XPS 13 comes outfitted with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors plus lighting, quick storage and memory, all while coming in at a very affordable starting price. For these reasons, it easily takes the top slot as the best Ultrabook and the best overall laptop.

2. Asus Zenbook UX305

This laptop should cost a lot more than it does

CPU: 900MHz Intel Core M3-6Y30 (dual-core, 4MB cache, up to 2.2GHz) | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 8GB DDR3 | Screen: 13.3-inch FHD 1920 x 1080 | Storage: 256GB SSD

Incredibly thin and light

Vibrant, glare-free screen

Excellent inputs

Weak graphics power

This is one of the best value Ultrabooks on the market and has been on our shortlist for a few months already. Its price has gone up marginally because of the exchange rate but with a gorgeous finish, a full HD display and a Core M CPU for under £600, it's the one to beat.

3. Acer Aspire S 13

Proof the MacBook Air is getting old

CPU: Intel Core i3 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 520 – 620 | RAM: 4GB – 8GB | Screen: 13.3-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) anti-glare IPS touch | Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD

High performance

Decent battery life

Great prices

Shell feels a little cheap

Arguably, the MacBook Air is no more, but the clones never stop coming. Among them is the Acer Aspire S 13. It’s not quite as thin and light as many prominently featured Ultrabooks, nor is it particularly premium. However, the Aspire S 13 packs quite a punch when it comes to performance. USB-C and a full HD display put it just over the edge in beating out the 13-inch Air, and for a much lower cost. Despite the powerful CPU, the Acer Aspire S 13 even manages a battery life of 7 hours and 49 minutes, according to our testing.

4. Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming

Gaming on a budget done right

CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 | Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 – 1050 Ti; Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB – 32GB | Screen: 15.6-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) – UHD (3,840 x 2,160) anti-glare | Storage: 256GB – 512GB SSD; 512GB – 1TB HDD; 8GB SSHD

Stellar battery life

Ports for days

Screen is lacking

It is relatively pricey, but this Inspiron absolutely nails it when it comes to value, especially for hardcore gamers. This is among the strongest laptops housing Nvidia's new, low-end GTX 1050 graphics chips. The latest Intel Core series processors, full HD displays and tons of storage options make the Inspiron 15 Gaming a fine solution for PC gamers on a budget.

5. Lenovo Yoga Book

Is this the netbook of the future – the ultra netbook?

CPU: Quad-core Intel Atom x5 | Graphics: Intel HD 400 | RAM: 4GB | Screen: 10.1-inch (1,920 x 1,200) LED | Storage: 64GB flash

Insanely thin and light

Halo Keyboard surprisingly accurate

Underpowered

Dated microUSB port

Lenovo has crafted a brilliant, forward-thinking device that could very well create a subcategory in computing all of its own. The modest specs hold it back from taking on the big boys in terms of raw power, but the innovative digital touchpad keyboard and drawing surface look like trendsetters to us. The Android version is currently about $100 cheaper than the Windows one (click ""see all prices"" above to see all options).

6. Asus Chromebook Flip

The premium Chromebook is finally affordable

CPU: Intel Pentium 4405Y – Intel Core m3-6Y30 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 4GB | Screen: 12.5-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) LED backlit anti-glare | Storage: 32GB – 64GB eMMC

Elegant tablet mode

Tactile keyboard

No out-of-box Android app support

Middling speakers

Before Asus's latest flipping Chromebook came around, pickings were slim when it came to affordable models with full-on Intel Core processors and 1080p displays, not to mention touchscreens, backlit keyboards and USB-C ports. It may use an Intel Pentium chip on the low-end, but the Asus Chromebook Flip is by no means low-end. Compared to what’s offered by the competition, the Asus Chromebook Flip’s value is unparalleled, and that’s without getting into its pristine tablet mode, which blows other hybrids completely out of the water.

7. Microsoft Surface Pro 4

The tablet that can replace your laptop

Larger, sharper screen

Vastly improved Type Cover

Type Cover still sold separately

Tiny battery life improvements

Can a tablet really replace your laptop or home PC? That's still up for debate, but the best tablet trying to make that happen is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – and it does a fine job with the full blown version of Windows 10, an integrated kickstand and optional keyboard attachment. Great for for creative professionals, students and everyday folks alike – it's only the premium price that pushes it down the list, but if you're willing to pay for it, you're getting a lot of power – a lot.

10,Three brand new MacBooks expected to debut at WWDC 2017,"Fresh, new MacBooks may arrive much sooner than previously expected, according to a new report out of Bloomberg. The outlet reports, citing sources “familiar with the matter,” that Apple looks to use the WWDC 2017 stage this June to debut three refreshed MacBook models.

The models reportedly due for upgrades are, unsurprisingly, the MacBook Pro, 12-inch MacBook and perhaps even the MacBook Air.

Bloomberg’s sources claim that the new MacBook Pro will finally house the latest Intel Core i processor series, 7th generation or Kaby Lake, meanwhile the 12-inch MacBook will receive a similar upgrade – though the report makes no mention of which processor product line. (We wouldn't bet on it being a Core i chip somehow.)

Finally, Apple has apparently considered refreshing the all-but-discontinued MacBook Air, because sales have remained strong since it left the spotlight at Apple’s last Mac-related event.

Can't wait? These are the best Ultrabooks you can buy right now

Apple’s inimitable, impeccable timing

It’s almost like clockwork that Apple is rumored to be rehashing its entire MacBook line at its conference all about developers and designers. In the first week of May, Microsoft unveiled its new Surface Laptop, a machine practically designed to fill a perceived void left by the MacBook Air’s absence.

Used to casting the shadows in the industry, not trying to run out from behind them, this wouldn’t be a particularly surprising move for Apple.

That said, don’t expect major updates to how these laptops function in the same way we saw this past autumn with the debut of the Touch Bar. According to Bloomberg, these refreshes are marked internal upgrades aimed to instill a sense of dedication to the product line on Apple’s part.

And, this is not because Apple makes a particular ton of money on Mac sales, though the firm has enjoyed a recent uptick inexplicably. Rather, the Mac is Apple’s legacy, and many longtime Mac fans have expressed their distaste in how Apple has treated that legacy in recent years before and since the release of the latest MacBook Pro.

The image of the product that Apple’s foundation was built upon is at risk of being tarnished, and that’s something the company is clearly trying to avoid, judging by the recent spate of reports regarding both new MacBooks and Mac desktops.

As for whether Apple can rekindle the flame it held with much of the creative community for so long, we’d say that depends upon what upgrades come to said refreshed products. The latest processor is one thing, but a lot of photographers and videographers sure seem to miss those SD card slots, and a screen at least closer to 4K for the hefty price would keep with today's standards.

At any rate, this would mark the first time for Apple to debut hardware during a WWDC keynote since it revealed the last Mac Pro and an updated MacBook Air in June 2013, so this will no doubt be a keynote worth watching.",techradar
10,Meet three inventions ushering in the next generation of VR,"What’s next for VR? Now that the three main headsets are available to buy, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the hardware is more or less finished, and that now the challenge is now making enough software to get people to spend big on the headsets themselves.

But after seeing and trying out three new VR-focussed inventions, it's obvious that there’s a lot of potential left in the hardware that’s yet to be explored.

From full-body tracking to haptic feedback, VR's nagging issues are proving a hard nut to crack, but these companies are determined to make the tech work.

VR Touch

VR Touch is a deliciously simple invention that has the potential to help remove the need for handheld controllers entirely.

At its core, it’s a small haptic feedback motor which you attach to the end of your finger that simulates the sensation of touching things in VR. Move your finger close to a virtual button and you'll feel a motor pushing on your finger as though you’re pushing on a real button.

The invention’s creator, Go Touch VR , is currently working with HTC to allow its Vive ’s base stations to track the location of your hands. But, for now, motion tracking is handled principally by a Leap Motion sensor that’s attached to the front of the headset. The motor itself contains an additional gyroscope for more approximate tracking when your hands are out of sight of the sensor.

We tried the system with a single motor attached to the index finger on our dominant hand, but up to five devices can be used for a full hand experience.

The system is simple, but effective. Reach out to touch something, and the pressure on your finger gradually increases as your finger touches it. Interestingly, although there’s nothing there in real life you’ll find that the pressure makes your brain unconsciously try to stop your fingers from moving through the virtual object.

Of course, if you consciously tell your hand to do so, then your fingers will still pass straight through it. If you’re looking for something with a little more resistance (and a much higher price tag), then you’ll want to check out this next gadget.

Toia

Whereas VR Touch is an invention that focuses on making force feedback affordable rather than making it perfect, Toia is attempting the opposite, and the result is a surprisingly capable haptic experience.

It’s not the easiest system to get set up with. A device the size of a typewriter sits on a desk, and you then strap your fingers into individual harnesses which are attached to the motor via metal arms. The system we used supported up to two fingers, but we were told that the full kit can support many more.

It’s a pain to set up, and the device is bulky and immobile, but once you’re strapped in Toia manages to make you feel as though you’re interacting with real, physical items, in a completely virtual space.

The large motors push back against your fingers as soon as they touch an object in the virtual space, allowing them to do anything from resting on a virtual tabletop to picking up objects with real weight to them with two fingers in the system.

Because of its size, complexity and presumed cost, the team are currently targeting professional use cases. Another demo station had a controller the shape of a syringe to allow dentistry students to be taught how to correctly inject a needle into a patient’s mouth.

We tried it out and the effect was surreal. Once the syringe was inserted into our virtual patient, it’s range of motion reduced considerably, and we felt real resistance as we pushed it further. If you’re afraid of needles, then you might want to give this one a miss.

In its current form the system is very limited. The thick metal bars that are attached to each of your fingers mean that the movement of your hand is restricted (you can’t even turn it over, for example), and the motors weren’t quite strong enough to stop our fingers completely, leading to every virtual object having a squishy, rubbery feel rather than the hardness of metal or wood.

Shogun

If the other technologies on this list feel a little small scale, then Shogun might be of more interest.

The system, developed by Vicon Software, will look familiar to anyone who’s ever watched a behind-the-scenes documentary about motion capture in video-games or movies.

Covering an actor in little silver balls and having them look ridiculous is nothing new, but Shogun is able to take this data and, in real-time, apply it to a 3D model that wouldn’t look out of place in a modern console game.

Combining this with virtual reality means not just being able to see the precise location of someone’s hands and head, but every limb of their body.

Playing a game with someone over the internet could immediately feel like being in the same room as them, or the system could even track three players in the same space to allow them to see, and hence avoid, one another. With Nvidia currently showing off the potential for multiple Vives running off a single PC , this might be something that’s needed sooner rather than later.

Although the system currently requires you to get fully kitted up with a skin-tight motion-capture suit, Vicon is hoping that in the future they’ll be able to attach a couple of silver tracking pads to the outside of people’s clothes to make the whole process simpler.

The hardware's far from done

If these three inventions have shown us anything, it’s that there’s still so much more work that needs to be done on the hardware side of virtual reality before our Holodeck -equipped future is finally here.

The VR games might be getting better than ever, but it’s only once you’ve felt a virtual snooker ball push back against your fingers, or seen a fully-rendered torso in virtual reality, that you realize how weightless a lot of VR experiences currently feel.

These prototypes might be early, but already have us excited about the next generation of VR.",techradar
10,Assassin’s Creed Empire: will the series go back to its origins in 2017?,"Update: It's official, there's going to be a new Assassin's Creed game this year. The game's official Twitter tweeted a picture of the Assassin's insignia with the words ""A new era begins.""

Sharpen your blade. The Assassins will soon step out of the shadows... pic.twitter.com/nUrM4A57J0May 16, 2017

We now also have a date for Ubisoft's E3 2017 press conference: June 10 at 1 p.m. PST. If we're going to hear about Assassin's Creed Empires anywhere this year, it's going to happen there.

Original article continues below...

Assassin’s Creed has become a familiar gaming franchise, with a new mainline installment appearing just about every year since Assassin’s Creed 2 was released all the way back in 2009.

Just as Assassin’s Creed was becoming one of the old faithfuls of the gaming world, though, Ubisoft surprised us in 2016 by taking a year out. There was still a film and two Assassin’s Creed Chronicles titles in the meantime but no sprawling mainline game.

You don’t realize what you have until it’s gone and after just one year of being away people are clamoring to hear about what the next game will bring. After this break, though, expectations are raised.

In 2015 Assassin’s Creed Syndicate barely managed to pull the series back from the precipice Assassin’s Creed Unity had pushed it towards. Ubisoft wasn’t exactly firing on all cylinders.

With an extra year to refocus and get things right, though, fans are expecting the series to return bigger and better than ever, particularly as Ubisoft itself stated in 2015 that it was taking this year “to evolve the game mechanics and to make sure we’re delivering on the promise of Assassin’s Creed offering unique and memorable gameplay experiences that make history everyone’s playground.”

We’re now a good bit into 2017 and E3 is just around the corner so naturally rumors around the next game are piling up.

Cut to the chase

What is it? The next and highly-anticipated installment in the historical adventure franchise

The next and highly-anticipated installment in the historical adventure franchise What can I play it on? Most likely PS4, Xbox One and PC

Most likely PS4, Xbox One and PC When can I play it? Late 2017 is the most likely date, if not later

Release date

Ubisoft announced its year release break prior to the launch of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate in 2015. After there was indeed no mainline release in 2016, we’re now expecting to see the next Assassin’s Creed game sometime in 2017.

Traditionally Assassin’s Creed games have been launched later in the year (every mainline game in the series to date has been released on console in November or very late October) so we're expecting a similar release window for this next title.

E3 is rapidly approaching and it’s reasonable to expect that there’ll be some kind of official reveal there with a loose release window attached.

Assassin's Creed Empire's first screenshot?

It looks like we may have our first look at the next Assassin's Creed game.

Though we recommended taking the image with a pinch of salt, it's looking increasingly likely that it's legitimate after Eurogamer has said that three separate sources can confirm it's the real deal.

A Reddit user has posted a screenshot on the Assassin's Creed subreddit under a disposable account that's now been deleted and you can see it below:

The screenshot does look like it matches up with the other rumors floating around that the game will be set in ancient Egypt and will feature a massive open world that can be explored using boats.

One of the missions on the top right hand side of the screen tasks players with following ""Shadya to Khenut's villa"" and a quick google search reveals that Khenut was a queen of Egypt during the Fifth Dynasty.

Naturally, Ubisoft isn't commenting on the veracity of the image.

News and rumors

Story and setting

For a while now the next Assassin’s Creed title has been referred to as Empire after a report from Kotaku suggested this was the code name being used for the game’s development.

Kotaku’s report also suggested that the game would be set in ancient Egypt.

A more recent report from WWG, however, has suggested that though this setting is correct, its final title will be Origins not Empire.

WWG claims to have spoken from sources at Ubisoft and reports that these sources not only confirmed that the game will be revealed at E3, but that the “vast open world adventure” has been called Origins because the game’s story will explore the original assassin’s guild in Egypt.

From a marketing point of view the name also establishes the game as a fresh start for the series.

Exactly how the game will explore the original assassin’s guild is unclear. The most likely scenario is that it’ll delve into how and why the guild was started but this is just speculation.

According to WWG’s sources, the game will feature two protagonists – a man and a woman like Assassin’s Creed Syndicate - but it’ll be much less linear than previous games in the series and character progression is “less tied to the story.”

One source apparently repeatedly compared the game’s approach to progression and story to Bethesda’s Skyrim.

The report also states that Origins is “huge”, the biggest Assassin’s Creed game to date, and that though it is set in ancient Egypt players will be able to explore beyond this, possibly as far as Greece.

This kind of exploration in this time frame naturally means boats, and the sources have suggested that naval exploration and combat will feature. As massive fans of Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, we couldn't be happier with this news.

Unrestrained progression and exploration is indeed a significant change for the Assassin’s Creed franchise and it’ll be interesting to see how a more open-ended playground approach would work, if that is the direction Ubisoft is planning to move in.

Gameplay

By this point Assassin’s Creed’s gameplay has become extremely familiar but with Ubisoft stating that it intends to “evolve” the mechanics we’re excited to see what could change.

We imagine there’ll still be the usual free running and stealthy attacks with hidden blades combined with naval exploration and combat that will hopefully draw heavily on Black Flag. However, the suggestion that character progression will be less tied to the story is likely to mean an entirely new approach to gathering experience and unlocking new moves and equipment.

It’s looking increasingly likely that the two protagonist approach taken by Syndicate is set to return in Origins, too. Whether players will choose a single protagonist they’d like to play as or whether they’ll move between the two (in the same setting or between past and future) as they play isn’t yet known.

What we'd like to see

Fewer bugs and glitches

Bugs and glitches – it’s an obvious one but it’s what we’d like to see. Or rather, it’s something we’d like to see less of. Though Assassin’s Creed is known for its gorgeous historical visuals, it’s also renowned for being plagued with visual and gameplay problems.

Unity in particular was widely criticized for glitchy, borderline frightening character animations and this is an issue we’d really like to see ironed out. If rumors that this will be the biggest Assassin’s Creed game to date are true, it’s more important than ever that Ubisoft focuses uses the additional time it's taking to perfect the finer details and doesn’t let them slip through the cracks when creating the larger game world.

Better combat

Assassin’s Creed’s combat isn’t bad but it’s not particularly inspiring or exciting. Despite the fact that you’re an assassin, it has often been easier to simply barge into a combat situation and fight your way through rather than apply any kind of stealth.

Once you are engaged in close combat you mostly find yourself button mashing or waiting for the right time to counter and get a cool slow-mo finishing move. Being an assassin should feel more urgent and tense than it does in the Assassin’s Creed games and we’d like to see some changes that bring this about.

Quality over quantity

It's being reported that this is the biggest Assassin’s Creed game to date and that there’ll be a much larger focus on exploration than we’ve ever seen before. In fact, comparisons are being drawn to Skyrim. This is making us both excited and nervous.

More freedom to explore a historical world sounds fantastic and we love the idea that we could become any kind of assassin we like with a new approach to character progression.

What we don’t want to see, though, is a huge explorable game world with too few quests to keep us interested or a great number of quests that are repetitive and grinding.

A larger map is all well and good as long as it feels necessary. If it really is going to be a much larger and less linear game, we’d love Assassin’s Creed Origins to have diverse characters, environments and quests to make it feel like this was a formula change worth making.",techradar
6,White House denies trying to influence FBI probe into Flynn,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share With FBI Director James Comey’s abrupt firing, White House staffers are worried over who's next. Nathan Rousseau Smith explains. Buzz60

FILE - In this Feb. 13, 2017 file photo, Mike Flynn arrives for a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trumps former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynns firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynns accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) ORG XMIT: WX202 (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)

WASHINGTON – President Trump pressed now-fired FBI Director James Comey to shut down the agency's inquiry into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing a memo containing Comey's notes from the meeting.

According to the report, Trump asked to meet with Comey alone following a national security briefing involving Vice President Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

""I hope you can let this go,'' Trump told Comey during a February meeting at the White House, according to portions of the memo that was read to the newspaper.

Trump was apparently referring to the bureau's ongoing counterintelligence inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates – including Flynn – and Russian officials seeking to influence the presidential election.

Trump abruptly fired Comey last week, in a move Democratic lawmakers decried as an attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

The White House strongly disputed the claims late Wednesday. ""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" the White House said in a statement.

While the Times called the memo ""a paper trail Mr. Comey created documenting what he perceived as the president’s improper efforts to influence an ongoing investigation,"" the White House insisted it did no such thing.

""The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations,"" the White House said. ""This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.”

On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, lawmakers on both parties appeared ready to see evidence Trump might have tried to use its influence to shut down the FBI investigation into his campaign – whether voluntarily, or by subpoena.

""@GOPOversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists,"" tweeted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform panel charged with overseeing the administration. ""I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee which is leading a congressional investigation into Russia's influence in the election, demanded Comey must testify about what Trump said to him – and bring his notes. ""Enough is enough,"" Schiff said. ""Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this.""

Comey ""needs to come back before the Congress,” Schiff said, and “share with the public what conversations he had with the president"" – including whether Trump tried to obstruct the investigation in any way.

Congress must obtain the reported Comey memos, he added. “We ought to ask if there are notes. Notes that were taken around the time of the conversation would be, I think, very powerful evidence of what took place during those conversations,"" he said.

He also referenced the president's recent suggestion that conversations with the former FBI director may have been secretly recorded. ""If the president was being truthful in the threat to Director Comey that he had tapes or might have tapes, we are going to want to get a hold of those.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he has invited Comey to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in order to tell ""his side of the story."" As he put it: ""I think it would be good for him if he did. It would be good for the country.”

The top Democrats in the Senate and House also chimed in. ""Concerns about our national security, the rule of law, the independence of our nation's highest law enforcement agencies, are mounting,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said from the floor. ""The country is being tested in unprecedented ways. I say to all of my colleagues in the Senate: history is watching.""

And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called it a ""brazen attempt"" to shut down the FBI's investigation. ""If these reports are true...(it) is an assault on the rule of law that is fundamental to our democracy. At best, President Trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power. At worst, he has obstructed justice,"" she said.

The meeting in question took place Feb. 14, the day after Trump fired Flynn because he had misled colleagues – including Vice President Pence – about the substance of phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.

The FBI has been reviewing Flynn's contacts with Kislyak prior to Trump’s inauguration, in which he discussed sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia. Those conversations were secretly monitored by federal authorities, as are most communications involving foreign diplomats. Flynn initially denied discussing the sanctions, but later said the subject may have surfaced.

The Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with the House Intelligence Committee is probing Russian interference in the 2016 elections, recently asked Flynn and other former Trump advisers to provide information about their activities.

Flynn also is also now under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform Defense Department officials about seeking payments from foreign governments.

When former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez committed suicide while in prison, his conviction for first-degree murder in 2015 in the death of Odin Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who had dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, was vacated.

Judge Susan Garsh, a justice of the Superior Court in Bristol County, cited longstanding precedent when it came to vacating the convictions of defendants who have pending appeals, saying in her ruling that she had no other choice.

Hernandez's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez was on Dr. Phil on Tuesday, the second half of a two-part show, to discuss Hernandez's death, his conviction and what all of it meant to her and the couple's daughter.

Host Phil McGraw asked Jenkins-Hernandez if Hernandez killed himself so she could collect $6.5 million from the Patriots, which could be available since his conviction had been vacated. Prior to his death, Jenkins-Hernandez said in an affidavit that his estate was worthless.

""That I don't know,"" she said. ""I think anything's a possibility, but I don't know what this was for. If he was sitting right here, there are tons of stuff I would ask. I can't speculate on what he was thinking. It's unbelievable to me. I don't believe any of it and I don't believe that was the cause.""

After the suicide, rumors came out that Hernandez had a lover in jail. McGraw asked Jenkins-Hernandez if that were true.

""The Aaron that I know, no. I got no indication that he was such,"" she said when asked about rumors Hernandez was gay. ""He was very much a man to me. It's hurtful. Whether it's true or not, it's not something I saw.""

McGraw then said that another prisoner named Kyle Kennedy was rumored to be his lover.

""I don't know who this Kyle Kennedy is,"" she said. ""Aaron never mentioned him.""

Kennedy's lawyer said, following the suicide, that Hernandez had written Kennedy a letter. Jenkins-Hernandez disputed that claim. She said there were three letters: one addressed to their daughter, another to her and one to Hernandez's lawyer.

""No, that's not accurate,"" she said in response to Kennedy's lawyer. ""There's nothing for Kyle Kennedy.""

WASHINGTON – If the commander-in-chief gives sensitive information to people without security clearances, can everyone else know it, too?

It seems the answer is no.

Revelations that President Trump may have revealed highly classified intelligence to Russian diplomats this week dominated headlines in Washington this week. Yet any classified intelligence Trump reportedly passed on to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in their Oval Office meeting would remain classified for everyone else, secrecy experts say.

If there was no formal, written change in the classification status of the information, ""no one else in the administration would have any reason to believe that it was no longer classified,” said Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy.

A government lawyer would argue that, because this was a private meeting, a disclosure by Trump ""did not serve to declassify the information,"" said Mark Zaid, an attorney specializing in national security matters.

""The mere fact that it then appears in the papers, either specifically or generally….none of that serves to declassify any of the information unless an authority in the U.S. government acknowledges it,"" Zaid said.

Presidents have broad authority to disclose classified information. Even though every other government employee with a clearance risks criminal charges for revealing classified information without permission, Trump has the power to unilaterally disclose any material without any formal process.

Trump on Tuesday defended his ""very, very successful"" meeting with the Russians. ""As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety,"" Trump tweeted. ""Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.""

Trump is correct to say he has the right to disclose information he wants, but that doesn't mean it's so simple. The reports from the Washington Post and others sparked an onslaught of criticism that the president may have jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State terror group, as well as the willingness of allies to share information with the United States.

National security adviser H.R. McMaster declined to say Tuesday whether the information Trump shared in the Oval Office last week was classified.

“We don’t say what’s classified; what’s not classified,” he told reporters. “What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation,"" McMaster said, ""and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged.""

Notably, though, neither McMaster – nor Trump himself – has denied the president shared classified information.

And the idea that the information itself is still classified was reflected in initial reports Monday night.

While the Post reported the intelligence in question had to do with Islamic State plans to use laptop computers as weapons and was so sensitive it had been withheld from allies and even some parts of the U.S. government, the newspaper withheld the name of the partner country that provided the information and other key details. Officials, they said, warned them against publishing the information could hurt intelligence capabilities.

While McMaster called it appropriate to share threats as a “basis for common action and coordination and cooperation,” he also said the decision to do so was made during the meeting – implying that there had not been some formal process to indicate the information is now publicly available.

Even so, members of Congress are trying to get a transcript of the exchange, so the information may inevitably spread more widely.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the White House to give the congressional intelligence committees — which have security clearances — a transcript of the exchange.

“We need the transcripts to see exactly what the president said, given the conflicting reports from the people in the room,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Until the administration fully explains the facts of this case, the American people will rightly doubt if their president can handle our nation’s most closely kept secrets.”

The White House hasn’t said what record of the exchange exists, though it's mentioned in the Post story.

Aftergood said it’s more likely that the transcript referred to in news reports is not from a recording but from an official note-taker at the meeting. “It would be logical for the congressional intelligence committees to request a copy of the full transcript in order for them to fully evaluate what took place,” he said.

There are some rules on the books outlining the unauthorized release of classified information. The executive order setting the official procedures for classified information requires anyone who thinks classified information to be compromised to “immediately report the circumstances to an official designated for this purpose.”

A 2013 analysis by the Congressional Research Service concluded that executive branch policy appears to treat unofficial releases of previously classified information to have no effect on the classification status.

But it's clear the White House does not see Trump's release of information as the problem. Instead, they criticized the leaks of classified information that generated the news coverage as the main national security threat.

""I think national security is put at risk by this leak and by leaks like this,"" McMaster said. ""And as you know, there are a number of instances where this has occurred. And I think it's important to investigate these sort of things, and to make sure that we have trusted organizations across our government that allows for the free sharing of information and collaboration.""

Zaid didn't see it that way. Trump appears to be acting impulsively to share sensitive information without understanding the consequences, he said. He pointed to McMaster's earlier comments that Trump hadn't been briefed on the source of the information he shared – which the New York Times reported on Tuesday was Israel – as an example.

While McMaster meant that as a defense of Trump's actions, Trump is ""now one of the most dangerous threats to our national security,"" Zaid said. ""He's taking actions unilaterally without understanding the national security apparatus and how intelligence works.""

6,Fox News host: I'm talking to White House about press secretary job,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host on Fox News show The Five, says she is in talks to become a part of the White House communications team. Buzz60

Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle told the San Jose Mercury News that she was in talks with the Trump administration about taking a job in the White House's press operations – potentially as press secretary.

Guilfoyle said ""a number of people"" have brought up the idea of her taking the job as President Trump's chief spokeswoman or another role.

""I'm a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,"" she told the Mercury News. ""I think it'd be a fascinating job, it's a challenging job, and you need someone really determined and focused, a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position.""

The cohost of Fox's The Five was once in the running to be press secretary, and has been a strident defender of the president. Last week, after news broke that Trump had fired FBI director James Comey, Guilfoyle called it ""another historic day.""

""He did something here that was bold, that was decisive,"" she said on Fox's Lou Dobbs Tonight. ""It was an excellent leadership decision.""

Guilfoyle, the ex-wife of California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, has been with Fox News since 2006. Prior to that, she worked on Court TV and was a legal analyst on Anderson Cooper 360. She was also a prosecutor in San Francisco and Los Angeles. She and Newsom were married for a little more than four years; during that time, Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco.

A Fox News spokeperson noted that Guilfoyle is a ""valued member"" of the channel's primetime lineup and is under a long-term contract.

""As I stated in the interview, I really love what I do and my job co-hosting The Five is tough to beat,"" Guilfoyle said in a statement provided through a spokesperson.

Guilfoyle's interview with the Mercury News comes amid reports that President Trump is looking to shake up his communications team, including replacing current press secretary Sean Spicer. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the president was considering ""broad changes.

Additionally, the New York Times reported that Spicer, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and communications director Michael Dubke were pulled into a meeting with the president on Monday, during which he lectured them ""to get on the same page.""

Those same words were mentioned by Guilfoyle during her interview with the Mercury News, noting the importance of ""being on message, being very well prepared... making sure that everybody's on the same page.""

Guilfoyle said Spicer was in a ""very tough position.""

""Sean Spicer is a very nice man and a patriot,"" she said. ""He's dedicated himself to this public service.""

Spicer has not commented on the speculation about his job, though he has continued to hold press briefings with reporters this week.

Last week, Trump questioned the necessity of having daily press briefings, following coverage of his firing of FBI director James Comey.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump said. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

3,Trump's sharing with Russia chills Israeli intelligence,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump is standing by what he told Russian diplomats in an Oval Office meeting, but it wasn't so long ago that he railed against intelligence leaks. USA TODAY

JERUSALEM — Reports that Israel was the source of highly classified information that President Trump shared with Russian officials last week left a chill among current and former intelligence officials here.

Israeli intelligence officers are taking the matter seriously, a military intelligence officer said Tuesday. The officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said Israel was warned months ago to be careful about sharing information with Trump's staff, and now that warning has been realized.

Read more:

Israel's vaunted intelligence service, known for an extensive network of human sources and technical collection throughout the Middle East, regularly shares detailed information with the United States, its closest ally. In January, the outgoing Obama administration warned Israeli intelligence officials that Trump's national security staff was inexperienced and should be handled with care.

Last week's incident will likely lead to some adjustments in the quality of intelligence shared in the future by Israel and other countries, said Michael Herzog, a retired brigadier general and former intelligence officer with the Israel Defense Forces.

Herzog said the incident could damage the level of trust and ongoing collaboration between the United States and its allies.

Countries will ""think twice before sharing sensitive information after an event like this,"" he said. ""Today there was some news from the Europeans, that they are thinking carefully before sharing delicate information. — I don’t want to overstate this, but it is real.”

The New York Times reported Tuesday that Israel provided the classified intelligence about an Islamic State plot that Trump shared at the White House with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The intelligence referred to Islamic State ""terrorism and airline flight safety"" that could impact both the U.S. and Russia, Trump said in a pair of tweets Tuesday.

As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017

...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017

A senior European intelligence official told the Associated Press his country might stop sharing information with the United States. Such sharing could risk intelligence sources, the official told the AP, speaking on condition that neither he nor his country be identified, because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

“It is a long-held rule among intelligence agencies that when you receive intelligence from an ally, you cannot give it to a third party without the explicit permission of the first party,"" Herzog explained.

The disclosure could also hurt sources and the ability to collect information on the planning for a possible attack, he said.

""In the worst cases, someone planning an attack can become aware that his plan has been uncovered and can change plans and do it in another way. In those cases, your chance of preventing a terror attack can be severely impaired,” Herzog said.

Another concern about sharing intelligence is that Russia could pass the information to its collaborators in Syria — Iran and Hezbollah, which are Israel's adversaries in the region.

Yet, Israel and Russia already share information regarding Syria, so any risk could be small, said Paul Scham, executive director of the Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Maryland.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has traveled regularly to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin since 2015, when Russia began its air campaign to bolster Syrian President Bashar Assad. Israel also conducted several airstrikes in Syria to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah. Israel and Russia have not interfered with each other's aircraft while operating close to the Israeli-Syrian border.

The Russians and Israelis share aircraft codes ""so they don’t shoot each other down,"" Scham said. ""Russia probably does not want to harm its relationship with Israel, because both of them have sort of an understanding that seems to have generally worked.""

16,Work and politics: What rights do employees have?,"Saily Avelenda left her job at a New Jersey bank following scrutiny regarding her political activism. (Photo: Daily Record.)

Should your politics outside of work affect your status in the office?

A congressman’s letter that helped push a New Jersey attorney to resign after her boss was told she was a grassroots “ringleader,’’ has sparked questions about how much an employer can clamp down on an employee’s activism.

The Office of Congressional Ethics has been asked to investigate whether U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-New Jersey) interfered with the workplace standing of Saily Avelenda, a former senior vice president at Lakeland Bank, when he called out her political activities in a letter to a member of the bank’s board.

In an era of heightened political tensions, when football players have knelt in protest during the national anthem and many Americans are marching and boycotting for perhaps the first time, the case is showing how politics and the workplace can collide.

“There’s no federal law that broadly protects employees’ political expressions at work,’’ says Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center. While she says some states offer additional protections, and federal civil servants can't be discriminated against based on their political beliefs, “private employers have a lot of leeway.’’

Still, in practice, while some employers may put limits on overt political activities in the office like tacking a campaign poster to a cubicle wall, what employees do politically in their private lives is generally off limits, says Edward Yost, of the Society for Human Resource Management.

“If they’re marching on the weekends, on one side or the other, those are their rights to do so,’’ he says.

Avelenda was involved with a local grassroots organization, NJ11th For Change, which since November has been demanding that Frelinghuysen hold an in-person town hall with his constituents, something he has not done since 2013.

In March, the congressman sent a signed fundraising letter to a Lakeland Bank board member, Joseph O’Dowd, noting the opposition that he was facing. He also tacked on a handwritten note that read “P.S. One of the ringleaders works in your bank!’’ Attached was a Politico article quoting Avelenda.

In this March 13, 2014, file photo, U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, left, R-N.J., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense, shakes hands with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, right, prior to Hagel's testimony on the Defense Department's fiscal 2015 budget on Capitol Hill in Washington. Saily Avelenda, a New Jersey woman who joined a group urging Frelinghuysen to distance himself from President Donald Trump's policies, says she quit her job at Lakeland Bank after Frelinghuysen's fundraising letter to the bank included a handwritten note saying a ""ringleader"" of the protest movement worked there, Monday, May 15, 2017. (Photo: AP)

Avelenda was later shown the letter by her boss, who told her that Frelinghuysen was a friend of the bank and that she should not use Lakeland’s name when engaging in her political activities, which she says she had not done. Avelenda eventually quit, and while she says the letter was not the only reason, it was a factor.

“When I was shown the letter, I was stunned,’’ Avelenda said.“I didn’t feel pressured when I was told of the letter. I understood they were caught in the middle of this, but I did feel uncomfortable. I wondered why I was being scrutinized.”

Lakeland said in a statement that it does not comment on the status of current or former staff members. But it says that its code of ethics promotes “that each employee has the opportunity to support community activities or the political process in the manner that she or he desires.’’

There could be repercussions for the congressman. The Campaign for Accountability, which calls itself a non-partisan, watchdog organization. filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics against Frelinghuysen.

“The House ethics committee requires members to act in a way that ‘reflects creditably on the House,’” Campaign for Accountability Executive Director Daniel Stevens said. “If trying to get someone fired for exercising her constitutional right to engage in political activity doesn’t reflect poorly on the House, what does?”

The complaint asks the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether Frelinghuysen interfered with Avelenda’s standing at her workplace, whether he misused his office for the prospect of political gain, and whether he violated the rule requiring members to act in a manner that reflects creditably on the House of Representatives.

And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to get Democrats elected in the House of Representatives, condemned Frelinghuysen’s actions. The DCCC launched a digital ad campaign on Facebook and Instagram Tuesday, targeting voters in Frelinghuysen’s congressional district and using a quote from Avelenda, saying Frelinghuysen used his position to punish her.

“Representative Frelinghuysen abused the power of his office when he targeted his constituent for exercising her First Amendment rights,” DCCC Spokesman Evan Lukaske said. “His unethical actions represent the very worst kind of politics and show exactly why he needs to be replaced next November.”

Frelinghuysen did not respond to repeated calls and emails.

Few workplaces have an official policy governing political activities on the job, though many discourage it, according to SHRM.

A SHRM survey released in June, in the midst of the presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, found that 72% of human resource professionals said their companies discouraged political activities on the job, 24% had a formal, written policy regarding activism and 8% had an unwritten policy.

Some states or local jurisdictions go beyond federal rules to protect employees' rights to political expression. Washington D.C., for instance, in its human rights code, protects workers from facing bias based on political affiliation, Martin says. The National Labor Relations Act, meanwhile, protects the right of workers to speak in the office about politically charged issues like raising the minimum wage or joining a union which are workplace issues. ""But otherwise, under federal law private employers have a lot of leeway in how they run their companies,'' Martin says.

Yost says that “generally speaking, employers may limit the discussion of political candidates at work because oftentimes those debates around fitness for the position may include mention of the gender, race, religion (or) age of the candidate which can be hot button issues.’’

If the company’s staff is gathered for an activity outside of the office, workplace rules about political statements could still apply. “They’re out there as representatives of the company,’’ Yost says,

A workplace’s restrictions may also depend on the job. Managers of a sales team interacting with clients may mandate that employees not walk around wearing campaign buttons. “If you’re working in a back office, it’s likely to be a little more relaxed,’’ Yost says.

But whether or not there’s a hard and fast rule book, employees need to be mindful of the potential fallout declarations about polarizing social issues or politicians could have in their office space.

“Any time you take one of those positions, pro-life, pro-choice, this candidate, that candidate, . . . you can certainly expect that people who don’t share that point of view are likely not going to appreciate it,’’ Yost says. “You may jeopardize their comfort level in working with you in the future which is a detriment to you, to them, and to the organization as a whole.’’

But even though private employers often have latitude when it comes to controlling their employees’ activism, Martin says that they should consider whether stifling their staff’s voices will keep them motivated and engaged. “I would argue that it’s not,’’ she says.

One of the Seattle Seahawks' most outspoken personalities and star defenders likes the idea of Colin Kaepernick coming to town.

Defensive end Michael Bennett said Tuesday on 710 ESPN Radio that he thought Seattle would be the ""perfect fit"" for Kaepernick, the free agent quarterback who opted to kneel during the national anthem in protest last season.

""I think a person that's dedicating their life to creating change, why wouldn't you want that type of leadership in your locker room?"" Bennett said. ""Why wouldn't you want a young person that's dealt with people wanting to kill him because of his choices in life? So I don't know why people feel like that is a problem.

""I think that Kaepernick getting the opportunity to be on our team would be really cool, would really be a good place for him because you have a coach like coach (Pete) Carroll who is up for challenges like that. You have an owner who spends and gives back to the homeless. You've got players on your team that give back in the community. You've got Russell Wilson, who shows that our team is built around community. So this is a perfect place for him.""

MORE COVERAGE:

Carroll said Monday the Seahawks are evaluating all their options, including Kaepernick, for a potential backup to Wilson.

Multiple Seahawks players, including Bennett, wide receiver Doug Baldwin and cornerback Jeremy Lane, backed the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback for his stance. Lane followed Kaepernick's example in Seattle's final preseason game, and the team later decided to stand with interlocked arms as a display of unity in response to Kaepernick's stance.

Sociologist Harry Edwards, who has served as Kaepernick's adviser, told USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell that three teams have reached out to him to inquire about the quarterback since free agency began, though he declined to name the organizations.

A favorite TV family is coming back to the small screen.

ABC Tuesday announced that Roseanne, a groundbreaking look at a working-class Illinois family struggling to get by, will return in 2018, confirming recent rumors about reboot negotiations.

Roseanne marks the latest reboot of an earlier hit series. Another pioneering hit sitcom, Will & Grace, is set to return at NBC next season as a 10-episode limited series featuring the original stars, and Fox has reunited original cast members for revivals of The X-Files and Prison Break.

The eight-episode Roseanne revival will be set in the present and feature the original cast, headed by Roseanne Barr, who plays the title character.

Returning characters and actors include Roseanne's husband, Dan (John Goodman); daughters Darlene (Sara Gilbert) and Becky (Lecy Goranson); son, D.J. (Michael Fishman); and sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf). Sarah Chalke, who took over the role of Becky later in Roseanne's nine-season run, will return in a different role.

ABC's announcement did not mention The Big Bang Theory star Johnny Galecki, who played Darlene's eventual husband, David, in later seasons.

“The Conners’ joys and struggles are as relevant — and hilarious — today as they were then, and there’s really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,” ABC programming chief Channing Dungey said in a statement.

Roseanne's working-class roots stood out when it premiered in 1988, with most TV comedies focusing on affluent families.Its return comes amid much discussion about the entertainment industry reaching out to middle-class and blue-collar audiences in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.

Moses Malone Jr. — the son of NBA legend Moses Malone — filed an amendment Monday to a civil lawsuit originally filed in September that alleges he was beaten and robbed by four armed men on June 25, 2016, outside a Houston strip club. Malone’s attorney, George Farah, told USA TODAY Sports by phone on Tuesday that Malone is now seeking damages from Houston Rockets guard James Harden, who Malone alleges orchestrated the attack.

Harden has not been charged with a crime.

Four men, including a security guard for the nightclub, Darian Blount, have been charged in connection with the assault.

The amended lawsuit alleges that Harden paid Blount $20,000 to lead the attack on Malone and that “it has come to light that James Harden was in fact at (the strip club) the night of the attack.”

Farah said that Malone believes the attack was retaliation for his Facebook post, which criticized Harden's youth basketball camps for charging $249.

Police have not connected Harden to the crime. Harden’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, did not immediately reply to a request for comment by USA TODAY Sports.

The original lawsuit seeks $1 million in damages for injury and loss of property against the strip club, V Live Houston. It alleges that Blount, the security guard, did not let Malone into the club and instead directed him to an area where three other men, armed with guns, repeatedly kicked and punched Malone in the face before stealing $15,000 to $50,000 in jewelry.

4,19 Things Funeral Directors Want You To Know,"Fstop123 / Getty Images

Dying can be a pretty bureaucratic life event. It starts when someone dies and their loved one reaches out to Carvaly's funeral home. At that point she first must gather a bunch of information that's needed for the death certificate, as well as details about the deceased's body, where they are located, and anything else the person who is responsible for the transfer of the body would need to know. She then provides all that info to a driver. Then there's more work to be done to plan a burial or cremation and help the family navigate that process.

Carvaly says that her job ""is about making sure the process goes as easily as possible for the people who are left behind."" And that can mean taking on a lot of administrative work.

""Honestly, the majority is paperwork,"" she says. One reason for this is that getting a death certificate completed and filed is a highly bureaucratic process. Basically imagine having to go through an official process with a state office — like getting your driver's license renewed — all day every day. But because the body cannot be cremated or buried until the death certificate is filed, it's something Carvaly has to stay on top of constantly for every family she's working with.",buzzfeed

Watts could not specify which energy drink Cripe consumed.

""It was so much caffeine at the time of his death that it caused arrhythmia,"" Watts sad, referring to a condition marked by an irregular heartbeat.

Watts told BuzzFeed News that according to eyewitnesses the biggest issue was that Davis ""slammed or chugged the regular-sized energy drink 15 minutes before he passed out.""

""That was the biggest issue, how he consumed that energy drink,"" Watts said.

Davis did not use alcohol or drugs and that the autopsy did not reveal any underlying medical conditions that may have played a role in his death, the coroner told reporters.

""This is not an addictive type of situation with him at all,” he added.

Based on his weight, Davis's intake of caffeine exceeded what is considered to be a safe level in that time period of two hours, Watts told BuzzFeed News.",buzzfeed

9,Undisputed: Will Tom Brady pass Michael Jordan as the greatest athlete in team sports? | FOX Sports,"Tom Brady's longevity gives him a chance

“Remember, Tom Brady didn’t say he’s chasing Michael Jordan the way LeBron always says he’s chasing that ghost, right? This wasn’t from Tom Brady, it was from Ian O’Connor, who wrote the piece. He just threw it out there. Brady had nothing but great things to say about Michael Jordan, and also, Brady would not even go so far as to say he was the greatest quarterback ever. So he was still playing ‘aw shucks, gee whiz,’ humble Tom Brady. Just for the record. It came across out of the headline that Brady was saying, ‘Well there’s only one other person I have to chase, it’s Michael Jordan.’ He didn’t say that.

""Now, back to reality. You will not find a bigger Michael Jordan fan than this guy. I’m an even bigger Jordan fan than I am a Tom Brady fan. Not so much a New England fan, but I’ve always been a Brady fan. I don’t know how you can’t be, but that’s just me.

""But in the longest run -- and I think this Brady run is going to go for a lot longer than you think -- I do think he has a chance to catch and pass Michael Jordan.”",fox-sports

9,Lilian Garcia tells hilarious story from her first day on the job in WWE | FOX Sports,"Longtime WWE ring announcer Lilian Garcia opened up on her journey to WWE and her career in the wrestling business on the latest episode of her podcast, Making Their Way To The Ring, and during the interview with her co-hosts she recalled a harrowing experience from her very first day on the job.

Following a series of auditions and interviews, Garcia was hired for a trial period beginning in 1999 – but she hadn’t been following WWE at the time, and had no idea who everyone was. She was informed upon arriving for her first day that she would be put on live TV for an episode of Raw that night – and just before the show went on air, she found out that she couldn’t use the cue cards she had prepared as a guide.

“They called me and they said ‘we’d like to try you out for two to three months. You can quit at any time.’

Well, hello! That’s pretty obvious. I’ve got nothing to lose.

So I show up. Iowa State University, 1999. August 23rd.

Atrocious… was it not atrocious? But they threw me in. I did not know I was ring announcing until 3:30. I didn’t even ring announce in my audition.

… The only thing I remember rehearsing is ‘ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Test!’ Nobody’s telling me anything.

Twenty minutes before I’m going live they told me I cannot use cue cards.

I had [the names] written out because Tony Chimel helped me that afternoon. Thank God for photographic memory, because what I did then right before I went up – I literally, I’ve never been at a point where I thought I was gonna get so sick that I was about – I was like, ‘bad time for a joke’. And they’re like ‘no, no, no Kevin Dunn does not like, this is not boxing, you can’t.’

But I’m like, ‘But I don’t know anybody here and now I gotta know their weights, and their towns, what type of match it is, and if they hold the title’?

I literally wanted to run ten minutes before we were going live, I wanted to run. I saw myself literally getting up and bolting outta there.”

Garcia said that she immediately started studying and memorized all the names and phrases she needed, and went on to have one of the longest in-ring careers of any WWE star in her generation.",fox-sports
9,Looking back on NASCAR's 'One Hot Night' 25 years later | FOX Sports,"If you weren’t at the 1992 running of The Winston — the race now known as the Monster Energy All-Star Race — it’s almost impossible to explain just how big a deal it really was.

That race, which occurred exactly 25 years ago tonight, was the first time NASCAR ever raced under the lights at a 1.5-mile speedway.

Sure, there had been hundreds, maybe even thousands of Saturday night races at small, dimly lit short tracks scattered throughout the South, but this was a revolution, a humongous undertaking and a huge, costly gamble.

Fittingly, it took place at Charlotte Motor Speedway, a track founded by Bruton Smith and a facility that has always been known for big ideas, big events and big money.

When it first opened in 1960, CMS hosted the longest race in NASCAR, the World 600, which today is known as the Coca-Cola 600. Advertised as “the race with the $100,000 purse,” the first World 600 paid an unheard of sum of money back in the day.

Since then, the track has been at the forefront of many other innovations, including the construction of 40 condominiums outside Turn 1 in 1984, and the installation of a state-of-the-art, $1.7-million MUSCO lighting system in 1992, making it the first superspeedway capable of hosting a night race.

And the track’s first night race was one they still talk about today.

Billed as “One Hot Night,” and run in front of packed grandstands and a crowd of about 200,000, the memorable 1992 NASCAR All-Star Race saw a fierce three-way battle for the win on the last lap among Dale Earnhardt, Kyle Petty and Dave Allison.

On that dramatic last lap, Earnhardt had his black No. 3 Chevrolet in the lead going into Turn 3, where he got turned by second-place Petty.

Coming to the checkered flag, Petty led, but Allison dove underneath him, the two neck and neck for the victory. At the start-finish line, Allison edged out Petty, but as they crossed the line, the two cars made contact and Allison went around, his black No. 28 Robert Yates Racing hitting the frontstretch wall hard, driver’s-side first.

With no SAFER barriers in those days, the savage impact knocked the Alabama driver unconscious. Allison was taken to a local hospital, where he spent the night.

Davey Allison (28) makes contact with Kyle Petty while crossing the finish line to win the 1992 all-star event.

For his troubles, Allison became the first driver to win consecutive All-Star races and for his trouble spent the night in a local hospital as his team – led by crew chief Larry McReynolds – had to celebrate in Victory Lane without their star driver.

“The wreck at the end was just as much my fault as it was his,” Petty said of Allison. “We were leaning on each other. I tried to chop him off, but if I had cut across in front of him, I would have ended up in the infield. At the end, he cut on me, as I would have on him. We clipped when we came across the line.”

Despite his last-lap spin, Earnhardt was thrilled with the first all-star race run under the lights.

“I can’t wait until next year,” Earnhardt said. “I turned Kyle down where he was dragging and sparking. He went into the corner and tried to take what was his. That’s all there was to it—good, hard racing. That’s what it’s all about. It was the last lap.”

After the race, Petty had to go to the track’s press box and to get there, he had to walk through the grandstands, which were lined with angry fans.

“According to every fan, I wrecked Earnhardt going into Turn 3 and I wrecked Davey right here. That’s a fact,” Petty said, pointing to the start-finish line.

Petty and then-CMS public relations manager Eddie Gossage walked without security into the grandstands. “They cussed us, they threw stuff,” said Petty. “It was ugly.”

Larry McReynolds, who was Allison’s crew chief, said he knew his driver was injured, but he was also concerned because the scoring pylon had listed Petty as the winner.

“That 5 percent of the racer just stayed in me,” said McReynolds. “I kept looking at the scoreboard and it kept the 42 up top. I knew we won the race. I was still looking at Davey. I kept looking at the scoreboard. Finally, they flipped the numbers. I was like, ‘OK, I know we won the race now. Now I’ve got to worry more about Davey.”

9,Bruce Bowen believes Zaza Pachulia’s play that injured Kawhi Leonard was intentional | FOX Sports,"San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard is listed as doubtful for Game 2 of the Western Conference finals thanks to an injury he suffered on a play by Warriors center Zaza Pachulia in Game 1 of the series that was questionable, at best.

The play that completely changed the game…. pic.twitter.com/RUuuomP58q — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) May 14, 2017

Even though both Leonard and Pachulia said afterward that neither believed there was anything nefarious about the play, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich ripped Pachulia the next day, calling what he did a “totally unnatural closeout.”

The irony of Popovich’s remarks, of course, is that he once had a player in Bruce Bowen who regularly and repeatedly made these same types of plays. Popovich defended it when his guy was the accused back in 2006, and now Bowen himself has chimed in, claiming that what he saw Pachulia do in Game 1 seemed to be intentional.

“That play? I’ve watched it and, yeah, I thought he took an extra step,” Bowen said, via Bleacher Report. “Plenty of time to stop where he did, but he continued moving in that direction of Kawhi. That seems like it’s intentional and it’s definitely dangerous.”

“What was his intent?” Bowen said. “You can rewind something five times and convince yourself of anything. What I saw, he kept moving in that direction after he contested the shot. You know you have to let a player come down. He kept walking into that space, so, for me, that says more about the intent.”

“I don’t know what is going to happen to Zaza,” Bowen said, “but if that had been me, I know what would have happened: suspension.”

Bowen had caused injuries to guys by walking under their jump shots enough times that the league called him directly and warned him to cut it out. But Popovich was fine with it then, and Bowen conveniently sees it as “intentional and dangerous” now.

9,"The Marlins need to tear down, even under a new owner | FOX Sports","Often when a team is sold, the new owner’s promise of a better day includes a pledge to increase payroll.

Whoever buys the Marlins should do just the opposite — shed big contracts, trade for prospects, stop trying to apply Band-Aids when a major overhaul is warranted.

Such a strategy would be a difficult sell for a fan base embittered by past teardowns under Wayne Huizenga and Jeffrey Loria. But what is there to lose?

The Marlins are 25th in home attendance this season. In the four seasons prior to that, they were 27th, 28th, 27th and 29th. Fans will embrace any new owner not named “Loria” — particularly if that new owner can articulate a coherent vision for the future.

Of course, the team is not yet sold, and might not be sold anytime soon. The Marlins’ financial picture, according to sources and published reports, is bleak. And if you’re one of the bidders — the Bush-Jeter group, the Romney-Glavine group, some other lurking collection — you’re surely asking, “I’m going to pay $1 billion-plus for a non-jewel franchise and inherit all this?”

“This” includes:

• The $295 million owed right fielder Giancarlo Stanton from 2018-28, provided that he does not opt out after ’20 and forfeit $218 million over eight years.

• The $52 million owed left-hander Wei-Yin Chen from 2018-20 if he declines to opt out after this season — a strong possibility with Chen perhaps facing a second Tommy John surgery (the pitcher is still owed all of his deferred $13 million signing bonus as well).

• The $28.5 million owed to third baseman Martin Prado in 2018 and ’19 — his age 34 and 35 seasons. (Prado already has gone on the disabled list twice this season for a strained hamstring, appearing in 17 of 37 games.)

• The $38 million owed to second baseman Dee Gordon from 2018-20 (Gordon, since returning in July from his 80-game suspension for PEDs, has a .636 OPS in 409 plate appearances, down from .776 in 2015).

Miami Marlins left fielder Christian Yelich . Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports

Make no mistake, the Marlins would be left with some impressive building blocks even if they parted with Stanton — most notably center fielder Christian Yelich, who is under control through 2022, and catcher J.T. Realmuto, who is under control through ’20.

Left fielder Marcell Ozuna might fall into the same category, but he becomes a free agent after ’19 and his agent, Scott Boras, generally prefers his clients to hit the open market.

Ozuna and Realmuto are 26, while Yelich is 25. Jose Fernandez, who died Sept. 25 at 24, was the one starting pitcher the Marlins also could build around. Now the team’s rotation is all but in ruins, and their farm system is the worst in the majors, according to Baseball America’s preseason rankings.

Oh, and by the way, the major-league club has lost 15 of its last 19 games entering play Tuesday, falling into last place in the NL East, a division that includes two rebuilding teams.

Give Loria credit for trying these past few years — Yahoo! Sports reported that he dipped into his personal wealth to help offset the team’s annual losses. But the plan isn’t working, hasn’t worked, won’t work.

The Marlins need to start over.

The team already has $95.3 million committed to eight players in 2018. The only way for the Marlins to compete might be to push the payroll to $150 million, and even then what would they be buying? The free-agent market is relatively thin, and the Marlins would be a long shot for a pitcher such as Yu Darvish — the true ace they desperately need.

So, get off the 70-to-80 win treadmill. Begin the deconstruction prior to the non-waiver deadline. And if the right deal arises before the Marlins host the All-Star Game on July 11, go ahead and get it done.

At the least, Loria can approve the trades of select relievers and the exploration of a market for Ozuna, whose stock might never be higher. The bigger moves — specifically, a deal of Stanton, who has a full no-trade clause — likely would need to wait until the off-season and/or until after the team is sold.

The Marlins would need to include significant cash in any Stanton deal, and perhaps do the same on a lesser scale with other players. The prospective ownership groups know this. And they undoubtedly are leveraging it in their discussions with Loria — along with the Marlins’ numerous other problems — in an effort to drive down the team’s price.

Yet, the Fish aren’t a lost cause.

The team’s baseball operations department, if given the latitude, is shrewd enough to pull off a successful rebuild. Tom Glavine, who lived through the experience with the early 1990s Braves, almost certainly would see the merit to such a plan. Jeter played for a Yankees team that always tried to win the World Series, but surely he, too, would understand that the Marlins are in a different world.

A teardown would not be pleasant. Asking Marlins fans for more patience would seem almost cruel. But shame on any new owner who fails to acknowledge the team’s grim reality and promises another round of fool’s gold.

9,Monster Energy All-Star Race is perfect testing ground for Goodyear's Option tire | FOX Sports,"How the compound was created

The new Option tire isn’t something Goodyear started completely from scratch. Tweaks to the set-up and compound were formulated from past experiences with the Prime tire, Stucker explained.

“The construction itself is the same between the Prime and the Option,” he said. “We made formulation changes to both the left side and right side. The left side is actually a known compound. It’s what we’ve raced at Fontana, Indy (up until this year) and Darlington. It’s a known quantity. We haven’t raced it at Charlotte, but we kind of know how it behaves. The right side is formulation change based on testing we’ve done historically.”

Goodyear then tested those new formulations and relayed that information to teams to give them a good basis for what to possibly expect.

“The formulations or similar have been tested at other places, so we kind of know what to expect with those adjustments,” he added. “The testing of the tire itself was done in the lab. Before every race, we do predictive testing for every combination that we run, and then we share that information with the teams.”

Overall, it was all about giving drivers a little more grip.

“It’s a known adjustment from the formulation itself to try to put a little more grip in that tire,” Stucker said. “Just getting a little grip out of both right side and left side. It’s a combination we haven’t raced, but it’s something we know about.”

The Prime tire is also the compound drivers will run in the Coca-Cola 600 on May 28 (5:30 p.m. ET, FOX).",fox-sports

9,"Redskins sign Bob Marley's grandson -- a 5-8, 200-pound linebacker | FOX Sports","The Washington Redskins are filling out their roster as offseason workouts roll on, and their addition Tuesday was particularly noteworthy. The team announced it has signed Nico Marley, an undrafted rookie linebacker out of Tulane.

You probably recognize the last name because he is indeed related to the late, great Bob Marley. He’s the legend’s grandson.

The 22-year-old led Tulane with 88 tackles in 2016, earning first-team All-American Conference honors for the second season in a row. He also had three sacks and two forced fumbles while roaming the middle of the defense.

Marley tried out for the Redskins at the team’s rookie minicamp over the weekend, earning himself a contract. His position in the NFL – should he make it – has yet to be determined, though.

At 5-foot-8, 200 pounds, he’s far too small to play linebacker like he did in college. Even though he did put up good numbers at Tulane, there’s no chance he’ll hold up against bigger offensive lineman in the NFL.

For comparison’s sake, Darren Sproles is 5-foot-6, 190 pounds, so only slightly smaller than Marley. Can you picture Sproles playing linebacker and trying to tackle Derrick Henry? Yeah, me neither.

That’s not to say Marley can’t make it in the NFL, but he’ll need to switch to offense or seriously bulk up and move back to safety.",fox-sports

Monday's bulletin, which is set to expire in November, includes new warnings on the techniques used by terrorists, like car attacks, that did not appear in the previous iteration.

""Terrorist groups are urging recruits to adopt easy-to-use tools to target public places and events,"" the bulletin reads. ""Specific attack tactics have included the use of vehicle ramming, small arms, straight-edged blades or knives, and homemade explosives, as well as other acts such as taking hostages.""

9,USA Gymnastics won't buy famed Karolyi ranch after all,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share With criminal investigations of USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar ongoing, much remains unclear regarding what happened at the Karolyi ranch and how much responsibility, if any, falls on the Karolyis. USA TODAY Sports

USA Gymnastics has backed out of its purchase of the Karolyi ranch and is exploring alternative sites to hold national team training camps.

The agreement to buy the facility in Sam Houston National Forest located north of Houston was announced on July 25, but USA Gymnastics decided to reverse course within the past six weeks.

“The decision was made for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to unexpected financial expenditures associated with the purchase,” USA Gymnastics said in a statement Tuesday.

MORE USA GYMNASTICS COVERAGE:

Bela and Martha Karolyi had hoped the ranch would be a lasting monument to their legacy with U.S. gymnastics. But it instead became tainted by allegations of sexual abuse by Larry Nassar, the longtime USA Gymnastics physician.

A woman who has sued Nassar, USA Gymnastics and the Karolyis said some of the abuse occurred at the ranch. The woman, a member of the 2010 team that won a silver medal at the world championships, also accuses the Karolyis of creating a “toxic” environment that allowed the abuse to occur. USA TODAY Sports does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault who have not made their accusations public.

A second gymnast, Jeanette Antonlin, also has said she was abused at the ranch. But, according to her lawsuit, she was abused between 1997 and 1999. Bela Karolyi did not become national team coordinator until November 1999, and USA Gymnastics said it could not find any records of national team training camps at the ranch prior to January 2000.

Jessica Howard, a three-time U.S. rhythmic champion, has said she, too, was abused at the ranch.

The Karolyis have denied any wrongdoing.

It is not clear what will now become of the ranch. USA Gymnastics is continuing to hold training camps there for the women’s program, rhythmic gymnastics, trampoline and acrobatics under an existing lease while it searches for a new site.

That could take a while. The portion of the ranch that USA Gymnastics was to purchase included three training gyms; a dance studio; housing for 300 athletes, coaches and administrators; and a dining hall.

USA Gymnastics has also been under scrutiny. An investigation published in August by The Indianapolis Star, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, found numerous cases in which the governing body had been informed of possible sexual abuse by youth coaches that the organization failed to report to authorities. Steve Penny, who led the organization as president since 2005, resigned in March and a replacement has not been named.

The Karolyi ranch began as a small hunting property and became the cornerstone for the Americans’ dominance in women’s gymnastics.

As personal coaches, Bela and Martha Karolyi would take athletes including Mary Lou Retton, Kerri Strug and Dominique Moceanu there to train. Since 2000, it has been the site of monthly training camps, the key element in the semi-centralized training system.

Gymnasts were allowed to train at home with their personal coaches, but traveled to the ranch to be evaluated by the national team coordinator. Martha Karolyi replaced her husband as national team coordinator in 2001, a job she held until retiring following the Rio Olympics.

The camps at the ranch have continued under Valeri Liukin, the current national team coordinator.",usa-today
16,"Review: 'Alien: Covenant' delivers vicious terror, but we've seen it before","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share When a crew on a colonization mission lands on an uncharted planet, they discover an unimaginable alien threat in 'Alien: Covenant.' USA TODAY NETWORK

Daniels (Katherine Waterston) meets with her crew's resident android Walter (Michael Fassbender) in 'Alien: Covenant.' (Photo: Mark Rogers )

The line between creation and destruction, birth and bloody death, is a subtle one in Alien: Covenant, director Ridley Scott’s intriguing next chapter in the long-running sci-fi franchise and a two-fold tour de force for Michael Fassbender.

A greatest-hits package of the previous sci-fi horror outings, Covenant (**½ out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Thursday night) combines the horrific chaos introduced in Scott’s original 1979 classic with the philosophical underpinnings of 2012’s Prometheus prequel, never quite carving its own place in the canon.

In 2104, a cosmic accident wakes up the sleeping crew of the Covenant, causing a ruckus and burning up the ship’s captain Jacob Branson (James Franco). On a mission with thousands of colonists and human embryos in stasis, the spacefarers — and their android assistant Walter (Fassbender) — are still seven years away from their target planet, but instead of going back to their sleep chambers, they discover a lush paradise world nearby that could potentially be their new home.

Terraforming expert Daniels (Katherine Waterston) and new captain Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) lead an expedition to the surface, where they meet David (also Fassbender), the synthetic man from Prometheus who's been conducting various science experiments on local fauna for the past 10 years. (He's an older, more human version of Walter's android model, thus the resemblance.) But the crew members also have a chance encounter with alien parasites, which begin to wreak havoc on their bodies. Anybody familiar with the infamous chest-bursting scene from Alien knows where this is headed.

Ledward (Benjamin Rigby, center) has something growing in him and crewmates Faris (Amy Seimetz) and Karine (Carmen Ejogo) can't do much to help in 'Alien: Covenant.' (Photo: Mark Rogers )

Exploding organs and buckets of blood have been seen before, though alien tentacles emerging while two folks engage in shower sex gives the film a certain air of fun creepiness. And the alien creatures themselves have never looked better.

The signature facehugger (the crabby creature that infects folks up close and personal) is a throwback that looks the same as it did nearly 40 years ago, but the malevolent Xenomorph is a CGI wonder, wildly headbutting spacecraft and slobbering at the sight of human meat. The humanoid Neomorph is a splendid addition to the bunch as Covenant on the whole makes strides in explaining the origin of the sinister species.

The ship’s crew, forgettable for the most part, aren’t overly developed, though expectations are low with fanged doom possible around every corner. Danny McBride plays against comedic type as pilot Tennessee but doesn’t have anything to do until the end, though Waterston strongly inhabits the transformation of Daniels from grieving widow to buttkicker supreme, a la original Alien star Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley.

The android David (Michael Fassbender) meets his maker in 'Alien: Covenant.' (Photo: Mark Rogers)

When it comes to memorable personalities, humans and aliens alike take a backseat to Fassbender, who is magnificent in his dual robotic roles. Walter is a more mechanical and later model than David, an artistic fellow who literally meets his maker (played by Guy Pearce) in the movie’s musical and minimalistic prologue. The scenes between David and Walter are particular engaging, with Fassbender playing off himself to give this lookalike pair individual personalities and motivations.

While audiences will be able to see the twist coming light years away, Covenant does succeed in continuing Prometheus’ ambition to deepen the Alien mythology with a meaning-of-life bent. Carnage may always be at the heart of this series, but Fassbender more than does his part to give it soul.

9,Boxer Ray Beltran fights for title shot and green card,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Boxer Ray Beltran can earn a world title shot when he fights Jonathan Maicelo in an IBF lightweight eliminator on Saturday. The result could determine the outcome of an even bigger fight - his battle for a US green card.

Ray Beltran looks to get one step closer to a title shot with Saturday's fight in New York City. (Photo: Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY Sports)

LOS ANGELES – Ray Beltran has been through the same struggle endured by countless others seeking to gain a United States green card, the same grueling battle through red tape and paperwork and the same nervous waiting game.

Yet Beltran's experience is different to the millions who have entered the U.S. illegally in that his long journey may end with an actual fight.

“This fight is the key,” Beltran, a wiry lightweight, says, as sweat beads trickle down a tattoo honoring his family name stretched along his back. “It is the key to everything.”

The fight he is referring to is Saturday against Jonathan Maicelo in an IBF world title eliminator at Madison Square Garden in New York. Win, and the 35-year-old will not only be entitled to a crack at the belt, but also, according to his immigration attorneys, be essentially guaranteed permanent resident status.

MORE BOXING COVERAGE:

​“(In boxing), the green card process is unique,” says Beltran’s manager, Steve Feder. “You have to prove yourself unique to anyone else, not just in the world but within the sport itself, you have to be a great fighter among great fighters. It is twice as hard. It is not about how long you have been here, if you pay your taxes, it is nothing to do with that.”

Getting an EB-1 green card requires proof of ""exceptional ability"" in a particular field, be it sports, music, or arts and sciences. Beltran’s long career, 41 bouts over nearly 18 years, supports his case a little, as do letters from major boxing network and sanctioning officials. However, nothing will boost his chances like a victory and a chance at the title.

“This is by far the biggest fight of Ray’s life,” Feder adds. “A lot of people say they are fighting for a green card but Ray is literally fighting for his green card.”

As he sits down after a grueling sparring session at Freddie Roach’s Wildcard Gym in Hollywood and slowly unwraps his hands, Beltran is greeted warmly by all, including four-division world champion Miguel Cotto, who arrives for a training session.

With the Maicelo bout looming, a co-main event to Terence Crawford’s HBO-broadcast junior welterweight title defense against Felix Diaz, Beltran allows his thoughts to shift to what a green card might mean.

“It is like a championship belt,” he says. “It is like winning the lottery ticket, because I know that being (permanent) here I will have a lot more opportunities. (If) I can be deported at any time, who will provide for my family and take care of them? I want to grow and do something and contribute to this country.”

Beltran grew up in Los Mochis, located on the coast of the Gulf of California. His father's side of the family were ranch workers and his mother's were musicians. The family was poor, living in a house made of sheet metal and cartons, and sometimes struggling for food.

Beltran crossed into the U.S. with his mother and siblings at 15, bouncing from Arizona to Michigan before winding up in Los Angeles and spending a decade as Manny Pacquiao’s preferred sparring partner. He is married with three children, with his family living in Phoenix while he trains in L.A.

Pacquiao loves Beltran because he is rugged and fearless and never says no to hard work, and the Filipino star used him extensively in preparations for the biggest fights of his career.

“Ray was probably my best sparring partner,” Pacquiao told USA TODAY Sports, via email. “He brought everything he had into the ring. He would stop at nothing. I love Ray like a brother. He has always been known as a family man and I admire that about him. I will never forget how much he has helped me all these years.”

Boxing hasn’t made Beltran wealthy. He will make a $100,000 purse for clashing with Maicelo, but a large chunk of that will be swallowed up with taxes and training costs.

Yet the prize he craves most, now tantalizingly within reach, has nothing to do with money.

“(A green card) is a big accomplishment, it is like a dream come true,” he says, having retreated to a changing area while the thud of Roach’s speed ball being pummeled by another hopeful reverberates through the thin walls. “It is to prove the people that just by hard work, a lot of blood tears and sacrifice, I have been able to reach my goal.”

Boxing has its favored sons, those fighters with either great amateur pedigree, the right kind of hype or some other factor enough to get them picked up by a major promoter and nursed to a padded record.

Others drift into the position of being the “B-side,” the underdog. In 2012, sitting on six defeats and with three losses in the preceding six-fight stretch, Beltran was very much in that position. Then, contemplating retirement, he was picked as an opponent by the promoter of Hank Lundy, then an up-and-coming prospect seeking a tune-up before a bout with Adrien Broner.

Beltran stunned Lundy with a majority decision win, gained some momentum and began to climb the rankings. Soon other problems emerged.

MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE:

He was seen as too dangerous but not famous enough for the top dogs in the division to take a chance against him. And in May 2015, he knocked out Takahiro Ao in the second round but tested positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol, and the result was change to no contest.

But Beltran (32-7-1 with 20 knockouts) has kept winning enough to get on the cusp of mandatory position, at which point the titleholder must fight you or relinquish their belt. Saturday’s fight can put him in that spot.

“It has been one hurdle after another but he keeps going through, he is the guy who gives every fighter in every gym in this country hope,” Feder says. “You have losses and you believe at some point you are an opponent. Ray is the great Cinderella story of boxing.”

Beltran starts to head out of the gym with the final stages of camp, including a nasty weight cut, ahead of him. But he wants a few things to be known first. He believes it is possible to be a proud Mexican and a proud American at the same time, to have love for your country of birth while seeking opportunity in another land.

He wants the formalities to be taken care of, to get the green card and later the passport, not to take opportunities from others but to prove the immigration officials right in giving him a new life.

He takes pride in how far he has come and how he stuck with boxing when it would have been easier to quit. He doesn’t get frustrated by President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on the topic of immigration. “It just makes me sad,” he says.

And while he knows that thorny issue divides opinion and that not everyone will support his right to be here, he insists he has been a worthy citizen, if not an official one.

“My only crime,” he says, “was to cross the border.”",usa-today

9,Warriors' Mike Brown laughingly says he was pulled over Tuesday to make room for Spurs,"Things have gotten a bit heated between the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs after Kawhi Leonard’s injury in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, but it appears both teams’ coaches still can share a laugh.

The Warriors’ acting head coach, Mike Brown, told reporters that he was pulled over by police at Oracle Arena before Game 2 on Tuesday, but not because he broke any laws. Rather, he was holding up the Spurs team bus, a moment that Brown relayed with great humor.

Brown was driving his SUV to the game and realized the Spurs team bus was behind his vehicle. The cops escorting the Spurs told Brown to drive through a few red lights to make sure the team arrived at the arena on time.

But before Brown made the final turn into the arena, he said a cop yelled at him to stop his vehicle. Brown then told reporters he said he pointed to his shirt and told the officer “Warriors acting coach,” drawing a lot of laughs from the media.

Brown said he couldn’t believe he was being told to stop in front of Oracle, so he continued to inch forward. He eventually let the bus go and then he gets a phone call. It’s Gregg Popovich.

“Mike, I didn’t know that was you,” Brown said Popovich told him on the phone. “He goes, ‘I’m sitting here, I see this black Range Rover, I see all these cops surrounding him, I see the car trying to inch forward, and I’m like, He’s about to get arrested.’”

Brown couldn’t believe it.

“I said, ‘Pop, this is my own building.’ He goes, ‘I know, when I saw it was you I died laughing.’”

6,The James Comey memo is an existential threat to Donald Trump's presidency,"(CNN) The reporting coming out of The New York Times and CNN is explosive: Deposed FBI Director James Comey wrote a memo following a February 14 meeting with Donald Trump in which he says the President told him ""I hope you can let this go"" in regard to fired aide Michael Flynn's role in the ongoing investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 campaign.

If true, that is almost the textbook definition of obstruction of justice, a charge that could well lead to impeachment proceedings.

""Reluctantly I have to say yes,"" independent Maine Sen. Angus King told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night about the prospect of impeachment if the claims in the Comey memo are true.

Given those incredibly high stakes, the White House has come out forcefully -- insisting that Comey's memo as reported misrepresents the tenor of the conversation on that February day.

""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General (Michael) Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" a White House official told CNN in a statement. ""The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.""

Here's the problem with that statement -- and the broader pushback against the story, which was first reported by the Times' Michael Schmidt : To believe it, you have to make all sorts of assumptions that seem very unlikely to be true.

The first and most important is that Comey is either lying or badly misunderstood a one-on-one conversation -- more on that in a minute -- between himself and the President of the United States.

If Comey is lying, ask yourself why. Why would the then-FBI director lie -- in real time -- about a meeting he had with the President of the United States? What purpose would that possibly serve?

If you think Comey just misinterpreted the meeting, his history on this stuff would suggest that's wrong. His detailed memory of an attempt by then-White House chief of staff Andy Card and then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales to convince then-Attorney General John Ashcroft, sick in the hospital, to reauthorize the domestic spying program in 2004, wound up being validated.

The second big issue with the White House story is, why would Trump ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Vice President Mike Pence to leave the room before making the request of Comey unless Trump knew that what he was doing was extremely iffy -- and wanted to avoid witnesses? Or perhaps he knew that Sessions or Pence might stop him before he even made the ask and he didn't want that problem?

The only possible explanation I could come up with is that Trump, always a believer in his powers of persuasion, thought he might be able to convince Comey more easily in a one-on-one setting than with Pence and Sessions around. But that seems far less likely, knowing Trump, than the other two alternatives for asking the room be cleared.

And then, finally, is the context into which this latest bombshell lands. Trump's entire presidency -- and his entire transition to the presidency -- has been dogged by questions about his campaign's ties to Russia. From Flynn, who was forced to resign as national security adviser after he repeatedly misled Pence and others about his interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, to Carter Page, a one-time Trump foreign policy adviser, to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, to political gadfly -- and sometimes Trump adviser -- Roger Stone, there have been a slew of reports that raise questions about the appropriateness of the interactions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

While Trump has repeatedly dismissed the Russia story as ""fake news,"" he acknowledged in an interview last week with NBC's Lester Holt that Comey's handling of the Russia investigation played a role in his decision to fire the FBI director. ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,'"" Trump told Holt

Trump has also acknowledged that he directly asked Comey whether he was under investigation and insisted that, on three separate occasions, Comey said he was not. But Comey allies have disputed the idea that the FBI director would have done so.

The problem for Trump now is that the story is spiraling totally out of control. Given all that we now know about Trump, Comey and the FBI's Russia investigation, it is going to be damn near impossible for Republican congressional leaders to avoid actively seeking out the Comey memo as well as any taped conversations between Trump and Comey. (Trump seemed to float the idea late last week that he may have a secret taping system, but the White House has refused to comment on it since that Friday tweet.)

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, in a tweet Tuesday, summed up lawmakers' appetite to read the memo: ""@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.""

.@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready. — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) May 16, 2017

If Comey's memo -- when Congress gets its hands on it -- says what the Times' and CNN's reporting says it does (and I am betting it will) then Trump's presidency becomes in serious and immediate peril.

The burden of proof shifts to Trump and the White House to show that what Comey wrote in the memo was simply incorrect. And, barring a recording of the conversation that proves Trump right and Comey wrong, that is going to be very hard to do.

Everything in Trump's first 116 days in office -- and there's been a lot of it -- was survivable in a political sense. If the Comey memo winds up being accurate, this one might not be.",cnn

WASHINGTON – President Trump pressed James Comey to shut down the agency's inquiry into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, said a person who has reviewed the notes the now-fired FBI director took of the unusual encounter.

Trump asked to meet with Comey alone, following a February national security briefing involving Vice President Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said the person who is not authorized to comment publicly.

""I hope you can let this go,'' Trump told Comey in the White House meeting.

Trump was apparently referring to the FBI's ongoing counterintelligence inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates – including Flynn – and Russian officials seeking to influence the presidential election. The incident was first reported Tuesday by the The New York Times.

Trump abruptly fired Comey last week, in a move Democratic lawmakers decried as an attempt to short-circuit the Russia investigation.

Comey kept his own log of all his discussions with Trump because he was suspicious of the president's motives, according to the source.

The meeting in question took place Feb. 14, the day after Trump fired Flynn because he had misled colleagues – including Vice President Pence – about the substance of phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.

The FBI has been reviewing Flynn's contacts with Kislyak prior to Trump’s inauguration, in which he discussed sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia. Those conversations were secretly monitored by federal authorities, as are most communications involving foreign diplomats. Flynn initially denied discussing the sanctions, but later said the subject may have surfaced.

The White House strongly disputed the claims late Wednesday. ""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" the White House said in a statement.

""The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations,"" the White House said. ""This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.”

On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, lawmakers on both parties appeared ready to see evidence Trump might have tried to use its influence to shut down the FBI investigation into his campaign – whether voluntarily, or by subpoena.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, asking for all notes, summaries, or recordings of communications involving Trump and Comey, by May 24.

""@GOPOversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists,"" tweeted Chaffetz. ""I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee which is leading a congressional investigation into Russia's influence in the election, demanded Comey must testify to Congress about his conversations with Trump. ""Enough is enough,"" Schiff said. ""Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this.""

Comey ""needs to come back before the Congress,” Schiff said, and “share with the public what conversations he had with the president"" – including whether Trump tried to obstruct the investigation in any way.

Congress must obtain the reported Comey memos, he added. “We ought to ask if there are notes. Notes that were taken around the time of the conversation would be, I think, very powerful evidence of what took place during those conversations,"" he said.

He also referenced the president's recent suggestion that conversations with the former FBI director may have been secretly recorded. ""If the president was being truthful in the threat to Director Comey that he had tapes or might have tapes, we are going to want to get a hold of those.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he has invited Comey to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in order to tell ""his side of the story."" As he put it: ""I think it would be good for him if he did. It would be good for the country.”

The top Democrats in the Senate and House also chimed in. ""Concerns about our national security, the rule of law, the independence of our nation's highest law enforcement agencies, are mounting,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said from the floor. ""The country is being tested in unprecedented ways. I say to all of my colleagues in the Senate: history is watching.""

And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called it a ""brazen attempt"" to shut down the FBI's investigation. ""If these reports are true...(it) is an assault on the rule of law that is fundamental to our democracy. At best, President Trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power. At worst, he has obstructed justice,"" she said.

The Senate Intelligence Committee, which along with the House Intelligence Committee is probing Russian interference in the 2016 elections, recently asked Flynn and other former Trump advisers to provide information about their activities.

Flynn also is also now under investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General for failing to inform Defense Department officials about seeking payments from foreign governments.

NEW YORK — The Los Angeles Lakers did not get the pick they wanted, but they got the one they needed.

Now, it’s on new Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson to deliver.

The 2017 NBA Draft Lottery felt like a throwback to the 1980s. The Boston Celtics won the No. 1 overall pick, and the Philadelphia 76ers took the third pick. But it was the Lakers with the most on the line — they would have lost the pick if not selected in the top three — and they nailed it by landing the No. 2 overall pick for the third consecutive season. What's more, had the Lakers pick fallen outside of the top three, it would'be meant a 2019 first round pick to the Orlando Magic as well.

The Lakers are in an intriguing position now that they have saved this pick: They have a bunch of talented young players and no reason not to try as hard as possible next season. Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson are entering their crucial fourth seasons, when it should become clearer where they place in the Lakers’ long-term plans. But the bigger pressure is on D’Angelo Russell, who enters his third season with many still believing he can be a franchise star on the offensive end.

Latest NBA coverage:

Adding another elite prospect, be it Lonzo Ball, Josh Jackson, Jayson Tatum or De’Aaron Fox, should free Russell up as an on- and off-ball playmaker. It also should help Brandon Ingram, the 19-year-old No. 2 overall pick who was asked to do a bit too much during the second half of the season yet still responded with improved production.

Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka will need to deal with a few mistakes of their predecessors, including the 2012 Steve Nash trade that almost cost them this year’s first-rounder and will cost them next year’s. Oversized contracts for aging veterans Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov last offseason do not fit with the team’s rebuilding plan, and the young core is nearly devoid of defensive-minded players.

But this is a franchise that had never missed the playoffs for three consecutive years before this current string of four absences in a row. Luke Walton is the Lakers’ fourth head coach of the past five seasons, but he is held in esteem throughout the franchise. Still, he joins Johnson and Pelinka, a longtime player agent, as a relatively inexperienced group at the top of a legendary franchise.

The 2017 NBA Draft Lottery has given the Lakers a shot at the talent boost they need. Can “Showtime” return?

9,2017 NBA mock draft and lottery results | FOX Sports,"The 2017 NBA Draft is incredibly deep, with all 30 first-round picks likely to produce for their teams sooner than later — and the Boston Celtics get their pick of the whole batch.

The Celtics cashed in on the 2013 trade that sent Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce to Brooklyn in exchange for the right to swap 2017 first-rounders with the Nets. Brooklyn, which finished the 2016-17 season with the worst record in the NBA, technically won the lottery, only to watch the pick go to Boston.

Oh, and good news if you're a Lakers fan: Los Angeles beat the odds to keep its 2017 first-round pick, which ended up No. 2 overall.

6,Memo: Trump asked Comey to end Flynn investigation,"(CNN) President Donald Trump asked James Comey to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a request documented in a memo written by the former FBI director , according to sources familiar with the matter.

""I hope you can let this go,"" Comey wrote, quoting Trump in the document, which CNN has not viewed but which was described by the sources.

The bombshell revelation Tuesday escalated the already raging political crises engulfing the White House triggered by the bureau's probe into alleged cooperation between Trump aides and Russia and new reports that Trump divulged classified information to top Russian officials.

Taken at face value, the disclosures about the Comey memo appear to provide the clearest sign yet that Trump tried to pressure the FBI and the Justice Department over the Russia investigation.

The stunning new developments triggered immediate claims from Democrats that Trump was guilty of obstructing justice and extreme concern from Trump's Republican allies on Capitol Hill.

The sources said that Comey was so appalled by the request from Trump, at an Oval Office meeting on February 14, that he wanted to document it in order to share his recollections of the encounter with senior FBI officials.

The White House, fighting back against yet another extraordinary political imbroglio despite its own compromised credibility, rejected the new allegations, first reported by The New York Times.

One official said that a ""conversation of that nature"" did not happen.

""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" a White House official said in a statement. ""The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.""

But the reports marked a grave turn in the drama surrounding the Trump presidency and put a new complexion on the President's firing of Comey last week, a move he later confided to NBC News was motivated by his anger over the Russia investigation.

CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin summed up the magnitude of the crisis by saying: ""Three words: obstruction of justice.""

""Telling the FBI director to close down an investigation of your senior campaign adviser for his activities during your campaign for president, if that's true, that is obstruction of justice.""

"" 'Close it down' is an instruction to stop investigating President Trump's campaign. Richard Nixon was impeached in 1974 for telling the FBI to stop an investigation of his campaign. That's what Watergate was,"" Toobin added. ""If (Comey's) telling the truth, I don't know how anyone can see this comment as anything but obstruction of justice.""

A former Justice Department official said that Comey's step in recording the details of the White House meeting was ""not out of character,"" especially if he was concerned about the legality or moral issues.

'A number of memos'

The encounter between Comey and Trump unfolded after the FBI director was in the Oval Office briefing the President along with Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to a source close to Comey who has a copy of the memo. After the briefing, Trump ""asked Sessions and Pence to leave,"" the source told CNN.

According to Comey's memo, the President said: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.""

He told Comey that Flynn, who was fired for lying to Pence about the content of his telephone conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the inauguration, hadn't done anything wrong.

Comey was ""concerned"" that the President was trying to ""stop the investigation,"" the source told CNN. ""He wrote a number of memos, a great many if not all were about contacts with Trump -- particularly the ones that made him feel uneasy.""

The source did not know how many memos Comey had written. But the former FBI director hopes that the President's threats about ""tapes"" of their conversations delivered last week indicate there are actually recordings.

""He would love to have them,"" the source said. ""One of his reasons for writing these memos is the concern this couldn't be corroborated -- but that could be met if there are tapes.""

Wallowing in despondency

Inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the mood was darker still.

""This is on him,"" meaning Trump, a top Republican close to the White House said, after speaking with dejected advisers inside the West Wing.

Even before news of the Comey memos broke, the West Wing was wallowing in despondency, amid talk of staff shakeups and as shock still percolated following reports that Trump divulged top secret intelligence to two top Russian visitors to the Oval Office last week -- a development that focused unflattering attention on the President's basic competence.

Reports seeped out of the White House that Trump is incandescent with the performance of his staff and is mulling a huge overhaul of the top officials who surround him.

Another day of crisis at the White House further distracted top officials as they prepare Trump for his crucial first overseas trip, which is now all but certain to be overshadowed by the Comey memos, but begins on Friday when the President leaves for Saudi Arabia.

Top staff, including Pence, left the White House to attend a fundraiser for the America First Policies PAC at a Washington steak house, Del Frisco's.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, chief of staff Reince Priebus, Trump's director of legislative affairs Marc Short and Energy Secretary Rick Perry are also in attendance, a source told CNN.

But it wasn't completely lonely: A source close to the White House confirmed former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski spent time at the White House Tuesday night.

Congress in shock

Tuesday's developments sent shockwaves up to Capitol Hill, where there has been increasing disquiet among Republicans about the catalogue of missteps and self-inflicted wounds inflicted so far during the Trump presidency, which seems to be falling further and further into disarray by the day.

The most crucial question now centers on whether Republicans begin to tire of the constant dramas emanating from the White House and edge away from a President who appears politically compromised less than four months into his term.

In an ominous sign for Trump, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent a letter from the FBI asking for the handover of ""all memoranda, notes, summaries and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan has endured a rocky relationship with Trump but has stood by the President during his trials so far in the administration. But there was no attempt to rush to the President's defense as he digested the latest stunning news.

""We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo.""said Ashlee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman.

The mood among Republicans was dark.

GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Trump supporter, complained that the White House keeps changing its story on big controversies and lashed out at the administration ford a lack of ""message discipline.""

Another House Republican said that there was a near-universal sense of concern about each latest report: ""I talked to many who are just fed up and want to move on.""

Another senior House GOP reacted to the latest debacle from the White House by asking: ""What the heck is happening over there?"" adding that it was time for Republicans to distance themselves politically from Trump. But on the question of impeachment, this aide said the House GOP isn't there yet.

""Gross incompetence is not an impeachable offense,"" the aide said, adding impeachment would be a ""big lift.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said that the former FBI director should testify before Congress about his conversation with Trump.

House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers said that the White House needs to answer questions about what happened and that Comey needs to testify ""as soon as possible.""

Senate Democratic Minority leader Chuck Schumer meanwhile delivered an ominous warning as he sought to pile pressure on Republicans who have been serving as a shield for Trump.

""The country is being tested in unprecedented ways. I say to all of my colleagues in the Senate, history is watching,"" he said.",cnn

6,White House struggles to answer GOP questions on Capitol Hill,"Washington (CNN) As the White House rushed to contain the fallout on Capitol Hill during a head-spinning week of controversies, one senator resorted to mime to describe his reaction.

He mimicked a cat, claws out, hanging on for dear life by clinging to a tree.

""We're all just like this,"" the senator told CNN, shaking his head.

""It's crazy,"" another senator whispered after giving a more diplomatic response about how lawmakers were handling the overwhelming pace of seemingly daily bombshell news developments. ""Just crazy.""

On Monday, The Washington Post reported he shared highly classified intelligence with Russian officials. A day later, the White House sought to push back against those reports, dispatching high-ranking administration officials to try containing the fallout.

Before dinnertime on Tuesday, the subject in Washington had changed yet again. But Trump's advisers could hardly call it a success, with the West Wing suddenly grappling with another firestorm: Whether the President asked FBI Director James Comey to close the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The back-to-back controversies threatened to further erode the credibility of the White House, which was already diminishing. The prospect of more drama -- Comey being called to testify, along with confirmation hearings for a new FBI director -- could fill the air for weeks or months.

""This weekly scandal, weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country,"" Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida, told reporters Tuesday night. ""It's a major distraction for the Congress and it's just bad for the psyche of every American.""

'Wholly appropriate'

The White House started the day hoping to ""calm Republicans on the Hill,"" one administration official said, with national security adviser H.R. McMaster coming to the White House briefing room to repeatedly say the President's actions were ""wholly appropriate.""

Other high-ranking administration officials were assigned specific members of Congress to reach out to, offering individual explanations of the story.

One official described it to CNN as an ""all-hands-on-deck"" push to correct the record and add context to the latest Trump administration bombshell. Another official describes the full-court press as an example of lessons learned from the firing of Comey, with an effort to swiftly answer as many questions as possible for members of Congress.

The White House calls also extended to other influential voices across Washington, with an urgent mission to try and turn around the story in hopes of minimizing fallout before the President leaves the country on Friday.

But once again, Washington whiplash. The day ended with even more questions about the ability of the President and his advisers to rise above another cloud.

""We have not done ourselves any favors by picking those earlier fights with the intelligence agencies,"" one administration official acknowledged to CNN, crestfallen at the seemingly endless controversies facing the White House.

'What more will there be?'

The feedback from Capitol Hill has been brutal, two officials said, with several members of Congress and staffers bluntly offering concern at the notion Trump may have shared classified information. Even before the latest Comey fallout, one administration official described a common refrain from lawmakers as: ""Good Lord, it's one more thing. What more will there be?""

There is rising agitation inside the White House at Thomas Bossert, the President's homeland security adviser, who was not in the meeting last week with the Russian ambassador and foreign minister. One official said Trump and other senior staffers did not plan to ""publicly throw him under the bus,"" but there is a sense of deep frustration at him for sounding the alarm and ""freelancing,"" as one official described it, by alerting national security officials to the President's message to the Russians.

But for all of the finger-pointing and blame-placing inside the White House, the common factor in all of the controversies is the man in the Oval Office. Senior Republicans on Tuesday evening conceded that cracks were beginning to form in the party, with an uncertain path ahead.

The President's decision to tweet on Tuesday morning, effectively undermining McMaster, took many West Wing advisers by surprise, two officials said, and complicated the explanation process. In hindsight, one official said, McMaster should have taken questions Monday night after his brief statement.

""It would have helped contain the Republican fallout right away,"" one official said.

For lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the repercussions from the delayed outreach were apparent Tuesday morning.

Republican senators spent the early part of their day expressing views that ranged from disbelief to annoyance, not solely because of the issue itself and the national security implications, but because they were simply out of the loop, which several made clear.

It wasn't just rank-and-file Republican senators who hadn't heard from the White House in the more than 15 hours since story broke. It was committee chairs, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, and perhaps most surprisingly, Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, and other more senior members of the conference.

It was the second time in as many weeks, multiple aides told CNN, where communications staffers were calling between offices trying to figure out who, if anyone, had accurate information, and more importantly, if anyone had an idea of how exactly to respond.

Sen. Marco Rubio, among those who did hear from administration officials on Monday night, answered plainly when he was asked if he'd received any more clarity on what actually occurred in the meeting between Trump and Russian officials.

""No,"" Rubio told CNN on Tuesday morning. ""We need to talk today -- and we will.""

Rubio said he had confidence the administration would eventually provide him with the answers he was seeking, adding: ""We'll see what happens after that.""

The ramifications, as one senior Republican aide described, are that of a domino effect.

Whatever the Trump administration does -- whatever the latest crisis, manufactured or otherwise -- will immediately be placed on the laps of GOP lawmakers. Every time they walk out of their office they will be met by reporters. Each time they go to vote on the Senate floor or file into a committee hearing, the questions will be lobbed their way.

Zero guidance

Yet, this marked another week where there was zero guidance on what exactly was happening -- or any ideas on how to respond -- from the administration.

As a result, frustrated senators had little incentive to defend an administration that has caused far more headaches than it has cured. And that only serves to create more negative headlines for the administration.

""It's the equivalent of hanging our guys out to dry,"" the aide said, noting that once McMaster took questions just a few hours later, several senators tempered their public concern and criticism.

The lack of ready information, combined with the administration's inability to move past issues, has led some to raise serious long-term questions about the administration.

""Exhaustion. Frustration. It's the distinct feeling that they'll never get their shit together,"" another aide said, describing the mood of he sensed from many of his colleagues.

But beyond the simple day-to-day frustration sits a broader, and substantially more significant problem: Republicans are staring at control of both chambers of Congress and White House, with an ambitious agenda conservatives have waited for years to try and implement.

Each day spent answering questions is about the FBI director, or a meeting with Russian officials, or the firing of Michael Flynn, is a day not spent on tax reform, or health care, or remaking the judiciary with new appointments.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, never one to speak without keenly weighing his words, made the same statement twice on Tuesday: ""I think it would be helpful to have less drama emanating from the White House,"" he told reporters.

McConnell batted away questions about whether he had lost confidence in the President or whether he could no longer trust the President in handling intelligence with the same clear ""No.""

But his overarching point was an understated, yet notable statement being repeated in one iteration or another by lawmakers and aides alike -- an ambitious agenda will, at some point, depend on the President to pull it across the finish line, with help from the White House welcome.",cnn
16,Story on DNC staffer's murder dominated conservative media -- hours later it fell apart,"It took only hours for one of the biggest stories in conservative media this week, which some outlets had chosen to focus on over news that President Trump disclosed classified information to senior Russian officials, to fall apart.

On Monday night, Rod Wheeler, a private investigator and Fox News contributor, put things in motion during an interview with WTTG-TV, a Fox affiliate in Washington.

Wheeler, who was under contract with the family of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was fatally shot in July, told WTTG-TV evidence existed that proved Rich had been in contact with Wikileaks before his death.

For months, right-wing media outlets have floated unproven theories that Rich was the person who provided Wikileaks thousands of internal DNC emails, and that his death might have been connected with the supposed leak. No real evidence has been provided to support such claims and Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, which continues to investigate the murder, says there is evidence to suggest he may have been the victim of a botched robbery.

Nevertheless, a handful of right-wing media outlets have latched on to the theory -- and Wheeler's remarks on Monday allowed the narrative to once again ricochet throughout the conservative media universe.

""NOT RUSSIA, BUT AN INSIDE JOB?"" asked Breitbart, the far-right website previously led by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, which said that ""if proven, the report has the potential to be one of the biggest cover-ups in American political history, dispelling the widespread claim that the Russians were behind hacks on the DNC.""

""DEAD DNC STAFFER 'HAD CONTACT' WITH WIKILEAKS,"" declared the headline of the Drudge Report, the highly-trafficked conservative news destination.

Fox News on Tuesday morning joined in the chorus, publishing a lead story on its website about the ""DC MURDER MYSTERY."" The story said Wheeler had made the claim Wikileaks had been in contact with Rich. It added that a federal investigator, who it said had spoken on the condition of anonymity, corroborated it.

But Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN he had no evidence to suggest Rich had contacted Wikileaks before his death.

Wheeler instead said he only learned about the possible existence of such evidence through the reporter he spoke to for the FoxNews.com story. He explained that the comments he made to WTTG-TV were intended to simply preview Fox News' Tuesday story. The WTTG-TV news director did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

""I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,"" Wheeler told CNN.

Asked about a quote attributed to him in the Fox News story in which he said his ""investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,"" Wheeler said he was referring to information that had already been reported in the media.

A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

Earlier Tuesday, Brad Bauman, a spokesman for the Rich family, released a statement in which he said the family had ""seen no evidence"" to suggest Seth Rich had been in contact with Wikileaks.

Bauman told CNN the outlets that had run with the story ""have shown over and over again that they are willing to lie and manipulate the facts"" to further ""their own political end.""

""I think it's important for everyone at Fox News to be careful with this information and how this story breaks because using the legacy of a murder victim in such an overtly political way is morally reprehensible,"" he said.

Bauman also said the Rich family was reviewing possible legal action against Wheeler for speaking about the case publicly. A contract between Wheeler and the Rich family prohibited from speaking to the media about his ongoing investigation, Bauman said.

""It is possible that this private investigator is in breach of a non disclosure contract,"" Bauman told CNN, adding that the private investigator's public comments have ""seriously impeded the ability of the Metropolitan Police Department to investigate.""

Asked whether he was in breach of a contract, Wheeler said, ""I don't know, it's hard to say.""

""I think that's something I will have to work out with [the family],"" he added.

Wheeler was put in touch with the Rich family through Dallas businessman Ed Butowsky, who told CNN he had offered to pay any bills associated with the investigation.

""You have a family who can't afford a PI. Their son was killed. So I offered to help out,"" Butowsky said.

Butowsky, a financial adviser, has provided commentary to Fox News on a number of occasions. He has also written columns for Breitbart, and was critical of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.

Speaking with NBC News, Butowsky had denied his involvement with Wheeler and the Rich family. Asked why, he told CNN, ""I didn't want to talk to NBC.""

Butowsky also said that, thus far, he hasn't ""paid any money to anybody."" He said Wheeler was investigating the Rich murder at no cost.",cnn

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Acting Warriors coach Mike Brown had a legitimate excuse for his late arrival at Oracle Arena for Game 2 of the Western Conference finals: seems he just avoided getting arrested right outside.

Brown was driving behind the Spurs team bus at a freeway exit as he was driving his son Cam — a huge fan of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich — and a couple of friends in his SUV on Tuesday. Initially, Brown was ushered through several red lights without having to stop, but then multiple officers on motorcycles yelled for Brown to hold up.

Even after he offered this:

""I'm like, 'Warriors acting coach,'"" he said, pointing to the logo on his shirt. ""He's like: 'I don't care. Hey you, stop!'""

At his final red light before reaching the gates to the stadium parking lots, Brown's luck ran out.

""I'm like, 'This is great, I didn't have to stop for any of these red lights,'"" Brown said. ""So I literally start to go and I'm going to get in the far left lane to go through where we all go through, and a cop out of nowhere pulls in front of me and goes, 'Hey you, stop! ... So I'm like feeling myself a little bit. I'm like, 'Hey, I'm being bullied by Oakland PD or San Francisco PD in my own building, my own parking lot.' So I start to go a little bit and another one pulls up: 'Hey, you, you heard him, stop!'

""So I'm like, OK. (They're) on motorcycles, right? If I scoot a little closer, they'll get a little scared, because I know I'd get scared. I start scooting forward. And then an SUV pulls up, and I hear them over the loud speaker: 'Hey, you, in the Range Rover, stop! Right now! You heard the officer! Stop! So then I got scared. I'm like I've got five cops around me, so I just stopped.

""I said, 'I'm trying to get to the game.' So I let the bus go, and the 18 cops, and I'm going around behind the bus.""

More NBA:

Once the Spurs got by, Brown's phone rang with a familiar caller ID — ""Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs.""

""So I answer the phone and Pop is dying. He goes, 'Mike, I didn't know that was you,'"" Brown recalled. ""He goes: 'I'm sitting here and I see this black Range Rover, I see all these cops surrounding them. I see the car trying to inch forward, I'm like, 'He's about to get arrested.' I said, 'Pop, this is my own building.' He goes, 'I know, when I saw it was you, I died laughing.'""

Popovich chuckled about it before the game.

""Somebody's got to teach him if the California Highway Patrol tells you to move, you move over,"" Popovich cracked. ""He didn't do that. But it was funny. They did a great job, by the way, getting us here. It was pretty cool to watch them. Everybody's getting out of the way wondering what's going on. It was much easier than normal.""

Brown said he did the right thing by just cooperating.

""I stopped, I did what they asked me to and I let them take care of San Antonio,"" Brown said. ""We got here just in time. Now I'm here.""

The French Riviera better get ready for an influx of celebrities, fans and photographers: It's time for the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival.

The film fest is one of the most prestigious cinematic events of the year, and cinephiles and Hollywood’s brightest will be paying close attention to the winner of the coveted Palme d'Or prize. But there’s also plenty to enjoy if you’re an armchair observer. From the stars to the parties to the movies (and TV shows), here’s everything you should know about the festival.

When is it?

The festival will take place from May 17-28 on the famed Boulevard de la Croisette in Cannes, with film premieres, red carpets and parties spread out during the run.

Who is judging the films?

Volver and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown director Pedro Almodóvar heads this year's jury. Four women and four men from around the world compose the rest of the jurors, including Jessica Chastain, Will Smith, Chinese actress Fan Bingbing, The Young Pope creator Paolo Sorrentino, Stoker director Park Chan-wook, French actress Agnès Jaoui, German writer-director Maren Ade and The English Patient composer Gabriel Yared.

There are other juries for some of the other categories of competition, including Un Certain Regard, headed by Uma Thurman, and short and student films, with Moonlight director Barry Jenkins..

Who else will be there?

You can expect Nicole Kidman, who has four different projects screening, to make an appearance. Other likely attendees include Julianne Moore, Kristen Stewart, Elle Fanning, Elisabeth Moss, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal and Marion Cotillard.

And we may get a cameo from Rihanna, thanks to her new collection with jeweler Chopard, set to debut at the festival, so look out for her and other celebs who come to enjoy the many surrounding parties.

There’s going to be great red carpet fashion, right?

Absolutely. The Cannes carpet is one of the biggest fashion stages in the world. You may remember it as the one where the “prankster” journalist dove under America Ferrera’s gown or for the dust-up over whether or not women have to wear heels to walk down it.

What are the movies I should look out for?

There are dozens of films officially in competition or screening, and they’re all over the board. But make sure to keep an eye on these five films that already are generating buzz: The Beguiled, a thriller from director Sofia Coppola starring Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst and Colin Farrell; The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which also stars Kidman and Farrell; Wonderstruck, starring Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams; Okja, a Netflix film from Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho; and You Were Never Really Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix. You might be hearing some of these names again through awards season (if they’re lucky).

9,2017 NBA Draft Lottery winners and losers,"Loser: Philadelphia 76ers

Joel Embiid represented the Sixers at the lottery and cracked a predictable number of Trust The Process jokes, but he wasn't laughing anymore by the time the results were revealed.

The best case scenario for Philly would have been to land the No. 1 pick and see the Lakers fall out of the top three, which would have netted the Sixers L.A.'s 2017 first-round pick as well.

Instead, the Lakers ended up with the No. 2 pick, and the Sixers ended up with only the No. 3 selection.",fox-sports
9,Lottery luck and Lonzo Ball are poised to make the Lakers relevant again | FOX Sports,"It honestly couldn’t have worked out any better for the Los Angeles Lakers.

It couldn’t have worked out any better for the sports world’s newest, and perhaps biggest provocateur, LaVar Ball.

For months, there’s been speculation that Lonzo Ball, the enthralling point guard out of UCLA, could find his way to the Lakers — that he could revitalize the Showtime Lakers on the court.

It was an easy connection to make — Lonzo’s dad, LaVar, has been making it for weeks, if not months.

“Oh, he’s going to be a Laker,” LaVar told ESPN. “I’m going to keep talking about it until it happens.”

It’s all part of Ball’s life mantra: “Speak it into existence.”

Well, after Tuesday, there’s little standing in the way of Ball’s vision — it’s going to happen, his son is going to be a Laker.

The Lakers had a less than 50 percent chance of keeping their draft pick in Tuesday night’s NBA Draft Lottery. They needed to be in the top 3 to keep their 2017 and 2019 first-round picks. Whether it be karma or Magic Johnson, they did.

And by landing the No. 2 overall pick they will in all likelihood be able to select the player they reportedly covet: Ball.

America, if you thought you were nearing the end of hearing about the Big Baller Brand, you were mistaken — you have a little more than a month to cope with the looming reality that the eldest Ball is going to be playing for his hometown team.

Now, there are ways Ball doesn’t land with the Lakers, but they aren’t likely:

• The Celtics, who landed the No. 1 overall pick, could select him — but when Markelle Fultz is on the board, it’d be malpractice to take Ball No. 1.

• The Celtics could trade the No. 1 overall pick to Chicago or Indiana for Jimmy Butler or Paul George — but again, the Bulls and Pacers would probably take Fultz No. 1.

• The Lakers could trade the No. 2 overall pick for either of those same stars that have been linked with Boston.

But do you see any of those scenarios happening? The Lakers not landing Ball is about as likely as me paying $495 dollars for a pair of sneakers.

The Lakers clearly covet Ball — had they landed the No. 1 pick, you could have easily seen the team taking him over Fultz.

Now, they can get their man and don’t have to explain their reasoning.

In many ways, this marriage is perfect. No, it won’t get rid of the loquacious and cocksure patriarch of the hooping family, but frankly, nothing would have — at least this scenario is optimized for maximum entertainment.

Let’s not forget that’s all this is — entertainment.

I see the metrics — love him or hate him, people can’t get enough of LaVar Ball. Now you have him playing the role of helicopter dad in the next season of the Lakers’ soap opera. He’s a perfect cast addition.

Will his son be able to return the team to its standard of incredible glory with his one-of-a-kind style of play? Will the laid-back coach and the media-savvy, overweening dad clash? Will anyone buy that overpriced shoe? How does Magic Johnson (what a casting get!) keep the peace if things don’t go well?

Malik Monk and Dennis Smith can’t provide that sort of intrigue.

The Lakers haven’t been relevant for years — unless you believe there’s relevance in a once great franchise being irrelevant. (Such is the world today…)

But come June 22, that will, in all likelihood, universes, and dimensions, no longer be the case.

It’s a win for basketball fans too — so much of this season was spent manufacturing narrative about a campaign that was ultimately highly predictable. There’s no manufacturing needed here, though — [insert price of shoe joke here] — it’s just a perfect marriage of star power, dysfunction, and talent.

You couldn’t script this better.

The Lakers’ beat just became one of the most fascinating in sports, and it has nothing to do with anything that’s on the court.

If the Lakers get lucky again, their draft pick, who will make them the biggest story in basketball next year, will also win them a bunch of games.",fox-sports
6,Trump to graduates: 'No politician in history... has been treated worse',"Story highlights Trump's White House is besieged by bipartisan questions in the wake of the Comey memo

Trump has so avoided directly talking about the controversy

New London, Connecticut (CNN) President Donald Trump, amid his own swirling controversies, advised United States Coast Guard Academy graduates that while things aren't always fair, ""you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight.""

The comment was a clear reference to the fact that Trump's White House is now besieged by bipartisan questions about his alleged request that former FBI Director James Comey to halt an investigation into his former top national security aide.

""Never, never, never give up. Things will work out just fine,"" he said in New London, Connecticut, Wednesday.

Then, dropping the pretext even more, he bemoaned the media coverage of his presidency.

""Look at the way I have been treated lately, especially by the media,"" he said. ""No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly. You can't let them get you down, you can't let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams.""

6,Donald Trump's silence on the Comey memo is deafening,"(CNN) President Donald Trump loves to talk. To tweet. To be quoted. To sound off. To make news.

To date, the only public utterance from the White House on the Comey memo story is a statement late Tuesday night attributed to an anonymous White House official. ""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General (Michael) Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" said the official. ""The President has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President and Mr. Comey.""

There was some expectation that Trump might speak with reporters -- or White House press secretary Sean Spicer might hold an off-camera briefing -- during this morning's trip to Connecticut for the president's commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy. Neither did. (Reports suggested that Spicer would hold an off-camera briefing on the flight back.)

Trump did say during his address to the graduates that he's been treated poorly by the media, but he did not come close to directly answering the reports about Comey's memo.

6,Why James Comey's congressional testimony will be 'one for the history books',"Washington (CNN) Few reporters know deposed FBI Director James Comey as well -- or have been covering him as long -- as CNN's Eric Lichtblau. Lichtblau, a new CNN'er after spending 15 years at The New York Times, has been reporting on Comey for more than a decade -- all the way back to the infamous 2004 hospital confrontation between Comey and then Bush chief of staff Andy Card and White House counsel Alberto Gonzales.

I reached out to Eric to get some perspective on what Comey will do next, the likelihood he told President Donald Trump he wasn't under investigation and who will succeed Comey at the FBI. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.

Cillizza: The big question is when/whether Comey will testify before Congress about his meetings and interactions with Trump -- among other things. What's your read on that?

Lichtblau: He'll almost certainly testify, and it should be one for the history books: Newly exiled FBI director pitted against the president who fired him. Add backdrop of Russian election influence. Cue the grainy Watergate photos of Sam Ervin and Howard Baker. And remember Comey has always had quite a flair for drama, as we saw exactly 10 years ago when he testified in the Senate about his famous hospital-room showdown with George W. Bush's White House aides at John Ashcroft's bedside. We could get a hearing in the next few weeks, if not sooner, and my guess is that Comey will insist it happen in public, not behind closed doors.

Cillizza: Knowing what you know of Comey, what do you think the likelihood is that he told Trump, on three separate occasions, that the President was not under investigation?

6,Putin offers record of Trump-Lavrov meeting,"Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered to provide a transcript of a controversial Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, raising the stakes in an affair that has sent the White House into a tailspin.

Speaking at a press conference in Sochi, Russia, Putin dismissed allegations that Trump had shared top-secret security intelligence with Russian diplomats as ""political schizophrenia.""

""If the US administration finds it necessary, we are ready to provide the record of the conversation between Trump and Lavrov to the Senate and Congress,"" Putin said.

The intervention by Putin could turn up the pressure on the White House to provide its own transcript of the meeting. The Senate intelligence committee has already demanded a briefing on what was said at the meeting from members of the Trump administration who were present.

The episode is the latest woe for Trump, whose administration is engulfed in a series of scandals linked to Russia. His meeting with Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak came a day after Trump fired FBI director James Comey , the man leading an investigation into contentious links between members of the President's campaign team and Russia.

Trump has admitted sharing security information on terrorism and aviation safety with the Russians, saying he had the ""absolute right"" to do so, but the White House has not confirmed or denied whether that information was classified.

The Washington Post first reported the allegations on Monday, saying that Trump described details to Lavrov and Kislyak about how ISIS hopes to use laptop computers as bombs on planes.

Analysis Some Russians are reveling in the political chaos gripping the United States, including politicians and the media, who are taking satisfaction in seeing their old geopolitical rivals writhe in political agony. There are two possible motivations in Putin's transcript offer. Putin could genuinely want to help Trump, and by releasing a transcript which may contain no secret information, the pressure on Trump will be relieved. The Russians had serious hope that their relationship with the US would transform. They need US sanctions lifted, and the more controversies that happen, the less likely that is. Russia wants cooperation with the US, but on its own terms. The other possibility is that Putin understands that by coming to Trump's rescue, he will create more chaos in the US. He knows very well that if he defends Trump, Trump looks even worse, and it sows suspicion in the minds of critics and the American people.

It reported that an official with knowledge of the meeting described Trump as saying: ""I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,"" just before revealing the intelligence. Two sources told CNN that the information was classified.

According to US and diplomatic officials, Israeli intelligence was a source for some of the information about ISIS bomb-making capabilities.

Trump's meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak came as the White House deals with a series of scandals linking members of Trump's team with Russia. The FBI has confirmed it is investigating these links.

JUST WATCHED McMaster: Trump's actions wholly appropriate Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McMaster: Trump's actions wholly appropriate 00:53

The White House has scrambled to respond to the intelligence scandal, at first denying the story, then arguing that it was ""wholly appropriate"" for Trump to discuss the information with the Russians.

""At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the President did not disclose any military operations that weren't already publicly known,"" Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters Monday night.

""The premise of that article is false that in any way the President had a conversation that was inappropriate or that resulted in any kind of lapse in national security.""

'Dumb, dangerous, dirty'

At the press conference in Sochi, Putin made light of the allegations.

""I think we need to come up with some sort of punishment for him, because he didn't share this secret information, not with us, not with the special services. This is really not nice of him,"" Putin joked, laughing with Lavrov, who was also at the conference.

But he then took a more serious tone, accusing Americans of ""rocking the internal political situation in the US under anti-Russian slogans.""

""They either don't understand that they are harming their country -- which makes them just dumb -- or they understand, which makes them dangerous and dirty.""",cnn
6,The scariest thought: What if Donald Trump just doesn't know what he's doing?,"(CNN) The fundamental question, always, when it comes to President Donald Trump is this: Is he following a grand plan that only he can see or is he just saying and doing things with no broader blueprint in mind?

The stunning nature of his election convinced most people -- including me -- that he was playing a sort of three-dimensional chess, executing a strategy that seemed crazy on its face but turned out to be crazy like a fox.

The events of the first 117 days of the Trump White House -- and, especially, the last 7 days -- suggest that assumption might be dead wrong.

This paragraph from a New York Times report today on allegations as to whether Trump revealed classified information to two top Russian officials is stunning:

""In private, three administration officials conceded that they could not publicly articulate their most compelling — and honest — defense of the president for divulging classified intelligence to the Russians: that Mr. Trump, a hasty and indifferent reader of his briefing materials, simply did not possess the interest or the knowledge of the granular details of intelligence gathering to leak specific sources and methods of intelligence gathering that would harm American allies.""

6,How newspapers in 10 key states covered the Comey memo news,"Washington (CNN) The news that then-FBI Director James Comey had penned a memo in mid-February in which he documented a meeting where President Donald Trump asked him to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties to Russia was a blockbuster inside the Beltway.

The New York Times, which broke the story, played it big on their front page

And The Washington Post went even bigger -- stripping the various allegations against Trump across the top of their entire front page.

But how did the story play in newspapers located in swing states in the 2016 election? Thanks to the Newseum's amazing daily collection of front pages from around the country , it's easy to answer that question.

And the answer is that the Comey memo news was, generally speaking, big-ish news in swing states -- though, in most places, nowhere near as big news as it was in the Times and the Post.

Others, like the Arizona Republic and the Raleigh News-Observer (North Carolina) , played it slightly smaller. The News-Observer, interestingly, went with an analytical piece focused on the allegations that Trump had leaked classified information in a meeting with two top Russian officials as its featured Trump item on the front page.

The Philadelphia Inquirer , proving the key to all newspaper subscription retention rates is local, went with the surprise victor in the Philadelphia district attorney's race. The Comey news was on the top right of the front page, signaling the story mattered and was worthy of attention, though.

The Denver Post (Colorado) got the story on its front page but in the lower right-hand corner -- the least prominent piece of real estate on the front. (Car insurance claims from a recent hail storm was the bigger story.) The Des Moines Register (Iowa) used a big picture of Trump to tease a story on the Comey memo inside the paper.

And then there was the New Hampshire Union-Leader , a notoriously conservative paper, which made only passing mention of the story with a pro-Trump blurb ""White House disputes Comey memo"" and teased to a story on B2. The other tease at the top of the front page? ""Cloud eggs: They're hot, versatile and trending.""

It's easy to lose perspective on how big -- or not -- a story is if you live in Washington or New York and, like me, spend a lot of time on Twitter and watching cable TV. Most Americans are just now beginning to pay attention to this Comey memo story and deciding how they feel about it.

In other words, we are at the end of the beginning of this story, not the beginning of the end.",cnn
3,Trump-Russia row: Putin offers to release meeting record,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'No politician in history has been treated worse'

Vladimir Putin has waded into the growing row surrounding US President Donald Trump and his links to Russia.

US media say Mr Trump passed on classified information to Russian officials last week, but Mr Putin says this is not the case.

He said he would release a record of the meeting to the US Congress if they requested it.

The news comes amid reports Mr Trump tried to influence an investigation into his team's dealings with Russia.

US media have quoted a memo by former FBI director James Comey that reportedly says Mr Trump asked him to drop an inquiry into links between his ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Moscow.

The fallout from both issues continues to consume Washington, with moves by Democrats to launch an independent commission starting to gather momentum.

As for Mr Trump, he told US Coast Guard Academy graduates in Connecticut: ""No politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly.""

Issue one: The Russian meeting

Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trump met Sergei Lavrov (L) and Ambassador Kislyak (R) last Wednesday

Mr Trump met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the White House last Wednesday.

The meeting came amid an ongoing FBI inquiry and congressional hearings into possible Russian influence in the 2016 US election.

It also came a day after Mr Trump dismissed Mr Comey from his post.

On Monday, the Washington Post, followed by a number of other US outlets, said Mr Trump had given the Russian officials information relating to the Islamic State group (IS) that could have endangered the source of the information.

The information was reportedly deemed so sensitive it had not been shared with key US partners, let alone Russia.

Mr Trump later defended his right to share the information, and his national security adviser HR McMaster said the president's actions were ""wholly appropriate"".

On Wednesday, Mr Putin joked that the meeting did not unfold as had been portrayed.

""I spoke to him [Lavrov] today,"" he said. ""I'll be forced to issue him with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us.""

Issue two: The Comey memo reports

While in charge at the FBI, Mr Comey was heading an investigation into possible Russian influence on the US election.

The Russia story has already claimed one victim - Mr Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired after misleading the government over his meetings with Mr Kislyak.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Mr Comey wrote a memo following a meeting with the president on 14 February, saying that Mr Trump had asked him to close an investigation into Mr Flynn's actions.

He reportedly shared this memo with top FBI associates.

""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,"" the president told Mr Comey, according to accounts of the memo. ""He is a good guy.""

Mr Comey did not respond to his request, according to this account, but replied: ""I agree he is a good guy.""

The FBI chief was later fired by Mr Trump. The official reason was over his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while at the state department.

But Mr Trump said in an interview last week that ""this Russian thing"" was on his mind as he made the decision.

The White House denied the allegation that Mr Trump had tried to influence Mr Comey.

""The president has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" it said.

A White House official also pointed out that acting FBI director Andrew McCabe had testified last week that there had been ""no effort to impede our investigation to date"".

The fallout

The Senate's Intelligence Committee said it had asked Mr Comey to appear before the panel to testify, and had asked the FBI for all relevant documents, including the memo.

House Oversight Committee chair Jason Chaffetz, a senior Republican, said the memo and related documents ""raise questions as to whether the president attempted to influence or impede the FBI's investigation"".

On Wednesday, the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said it was crucial to let investigations run their course before rushing to judgment.

But Democratic members of the House of Representatives said they would try and force a vote to create an independent commission into the Russia ties. Two Republicans backed the move, they said.

Has Trump obstructed justice?

Adam Schiff, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said this intervention by Mr Trump, if confirmed, amounted to ""interference or obstruction of the investigation"".

The key legal statute is 18 US Code Section 1512, which contains a broad definition allowing charges to be brought against someone who ""obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so"".

It has been pointed out that Mr Trump did have the legal authority to fire Mr Comey, but there is a legal precedent for otherwise lawful acts to be considered an obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions, the New York Times says.

Legal experts have told the Washington Post that that is not clear in this case as intent is difficult to prove.

However, former federal prosecutor Samuel Buell told the Times: ""The evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey's firing.

""Trump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.""

The view from Washington: Anthony Zurcher

The ""i"" word - impeachment - has already been broached. If this were a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, articles of impeachment would likely be in the drafting process.

Republicans still call the shots in Congress, however, and it's a significant leap to get them to abandon the Trump presidency and any hope of advancing their agenda for the foreseeable future.

For the rank-and-file to turn on the president will require them to admit their complicity in a failed presidency.

...and from Moscow: Steve Rosenberg

You can't help feeling that the Kremlin is loving this. As the US administration - and the US superpower - staggers from one crisis to the next, Russia is watching and revelling in a political rival tearing itself apart.

President Putin's comments today on America were full of sarcasm and patronising put-downs. He said he was ready to provide the US Congress with a transcript of Foreign Minister Lavrov's conversation with President Trump. But that was surely just another dig at America. He will know that it will take more than a transcript on Kremlin-headed notepaper to make this crisis go away.",bbc-news

French President Emmanuel Macron has unveiled a gender-balanced cabinet in accordance with an earlier pledge, with 11 of 22 posts taken by women.

Sylvie Goulard is defence minister while Olympic fencing champion Laura Flessel is sports minister.

Bruno Le Maire is economy minister, Gérard Collomb is interior minister and François Bayrou is justice minister.

Mr Macron's decision to pluck figures from across the political spectrum has sent the French right into disarray.

Mr Le Maire is a conservative moderate, Mr Collomb is the Socialist mayor of Lyon and Mr Bayrou is a veteran centrist.

Some 170 elected officials from the right were earlier criticised by hundreds of other lawmakers after they signed a statement backing Mr Macron.

One accused Mr Macron of ""blowing up"" the political landscape.

France's new president will hope his team delivers a majority in parliamentary elections next month and furthers his aim of political renewal.

He delivered on his pledge of a cabinet of parity - though only one of the top five posts, that of defence, went to a woman.

Other ministerial appointees include Jean-Yves Le Drian, in charge of defence under President François Hollande, who will become foreign minister. Nicolas Hulot, a well-known environmentalist, becomes ecology minister.

Mounir Mahjoubi - junior minister for digital affairs

Françoise Nyssen - culture

Jean-Michel Blanquer - national education

Jacques Mézard - agriculture and food

Marlène Schiappa, whose successful blog Maman Works saw her dubbed the ""spokeswoman for working mums"", becomes junior minister for equality between women and men.

As well as the political centre ground, Mr Macron also took in figures from the far left.

The announcement was delayed after candidates were background-checked for their tax records and any potential conflicts of interest.

'A slap'

It comes amid consternation among forces of both the left and right at Mr Macron's offer of ""an outstretched hand"" to join him in his proclaimed political project of bridging the divide long entrenched in French politics.

After he named Republican Edouard Philippe as prime minister on Monday, more than 170 elected conservatives agreed to sign up to his project, some claiming they were witnessing the ""transformation"" of politics.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has been accused of opportunism by some on the right

But their move was met by a counter-statement signed by more than 570 conservatives.

Ahead of legislative elections in June, Republican party campaign chief François Baroin accused Mr Macron of ""putting a bomb under politics rather than remodelling it"".

Meanwhile the Republicans' deputy secretary general, Eric Ciotti, was quoted as calling the pro-Macron initiative ""a slap"" rather than an outstretched hand - suggesting supporting Republicans were opportunistically seeking a role in the new government.

The initiative has also been criticised on the left, with defeated Socialist presidential candidate Benoît Hamon among the dissenters.

""Who can think that the left will pull itself together if it is part of a coalition led by a member of the Republican party?"" he said.",bbc-news

US soldier Chelsea Manning is celebrating her freedom after being released from military prison.

Manning took to Twitter after her release, photographing her ""first steps of freedom"" in civilian clothes.

In a brief statement, she said she was focused on the future, which ""is far more important than the past"".

She served seven years of a 35-year sentence for leaking hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military files to Wikileaks.

Most of her sentence was commuted by then-US President Barack Obama in January.

In a statement issued through the American Civil Liberties Union, which provided her with legal support, Manning said: ""After another anxious four months of waiting, the day has finally arrived. I am looking forward to so much!""

She added: ""Whatever is ahead of me is far more important than the past. I'm figuring things out right now - which is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me.""

A US Army spokesperson confirmed that she left Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in the early morning.

Image copyright Twitter Image caption Manning posted her message to a new Instagram account at the same time

The 29-year-old soldier was born Bradley Manning.

A day after she was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, Manning said she had felt female since childhood and wanted to live as a woman called Chelsea.

""For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,"" she said in a statement last week ahead of her release. ""I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world.""

Speaking to the BBC, Manning's friend, the journalist Glenn Greenwald - who was involved in the publication of leaks from Edward Snowden - said she faced a difficult life outside prison.

""She's going to live in a country where the top officials have expressed extreme denunciations of her, condemnations of her, who regard her as a traitor,"" he said.

""But the reality is that if you look back at what it is that she achieved, she revealed unquestionable war crimes, her disclosures led to reforms around the world.""

President Obama's decision to commute her sentence drew criticism from leading Republicans, including Senator John McCain, who called it a ""a grave mistake"".

'Back to Maryland'

Manning was convicted of 20 charges in connection with the leaks, including espionage. She was acquitted of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy.

She defended the leaking by saying she had wanted to spark a public debate in the US about the role of the military and US foreign policy, but later apologised for ""hurting the US"", saying she had mistakenly believed she could ""change the world for the better"".

In January she tweeted that she wanted to move to Maryland after being released, a state where she previously lived.

On Monday she tweeted: ""Two more days until the freedom of civilian life ^_^ Now hunting for private #healthcare like millions of Americans =P"".

Manning will remain on active army duty while her military court conviction remains under appeal. She will have healthcare benefits but will be unpaid, the army says.

An online campaign set up by her attorney has raised $150,000 (£115,725) to pay for her living expenses for the first year after her release.

If the appeal is denied, she could be dishonourably discharged from the army, US media say.

Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny is to step down as leader of Fine Gael from midnight, he has announced.

He will continue as taoiseach (prime minister) until the Dail (parliament) chooses a successor.

Mr Kenny, who was elected taoiseach in 2011, tendered his resignation in March, but has been acting prime minister since then.

He told a parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday that a successor would be appointed by 2 June.

The 66-year-old had been under pressure to resign from factions within his own party dissatisfied with his leadership.

The Fine Gael leadership contest will begin on Thursday with the new leader to be announced after an electoral college of the parliamentary party, county councillors and party members have their say.

The two favourites are Leo Varadkar, who is the son of an Indian immigrant, and Simon Coveney, whose father was also a government minister.

The former British prime minister, David Cameron, said Mr Kenny ""was a strong leader for Ireland, a great partner for the UK, and remains a good friend"".

10,Google IO liveblog: the 2017 keynote updates in real-time,"10:30AM: Google Assistant on the iPhone is huge news because not only is Google competing with Apple, it's also learning from Apple's vast audience. That means its machine learning capabilities will get even better.

10:29AM: Google Assistant is coming to the iPhone, right before Apple is supposed to announce a big update to Siri. Ouch! So in addition to Android devices, TVs, wearables and car systems, Google is coming to the iPhone.

10:26AM: Google Lens and Google Assistant are combining here, so you'll be able to learn about what you're seeing without having to ask about it with your voice.

The best example is visual translation. Tap the Google Lens icon, point the camera at an item on a Japanese menu (when you don't know the language) and ask Google Assistant ""What does it look like?"" and it'll give you photos. You don't need to input menu items you don't know about just to know what you're ordering before it comes out.

10:25AM: Huffman is talking about Google is cracking the hard machine learning challenge: how you can speak to AI bots with natural language and still get relevant responses. That's a giant hurdle.

10:24AM: : Google is showing a video montage of Google Assistant, with a big focus on the smart home. Scott Huffman is taking the stage, and we're expect big news one year after the company revealed Google Home and Assistant for the first time. What's next? We're about to find out. There's a lot to prove with Amazon Echo Show with Alexa and the the rumors Siri Speaker coming soon.

10:22AM: Google is pushing computers and machine learning so far is that you'll be able to use AutoDraw to have computers draw for you. It's now about being lazy, but teaching computers to do incredible things that haven't been possible before. Sundar joked that even he can successfully draw with AutoDraw.

10:18AM: Now the Google IO keynote is getting geeky, which is a good fit for the developer-filled audience. We're talking neuralnets building neuralnets with what Google calls AutoML. How will end users see benefits? Well, healthcare is the first big initiative of this machine learning benefit.

Machine learning can help detect the spread of cancer thanks to advanced Digital Pathology. ""Pathologists can improve diagnosis."" It'll also apply to basic sciences with DNA Sequencing.

10:14AM: Here are some uses for Google Lens, as demoed at the Google IO keynote. See restaurants in front of you? Well, Google knows where you are (because it knows everything about you via its knowledge graph) and will present reviews and information over top of the building.

Even better, crawling under your co-workers desk in order to get the SSID and password of a Wi-Fi router? Snap a photo and it'll actually parse out the information and connect you. There was definitely applause for that first-world problem.

10:12AM: Sundar is talking up the progress made in photos, with some light applause. The magic behind Google Photos is astounding. But it's just the beginning.

With that, Google Lens has been announced. It uses the camera to identify what you're seeing in real life. It's like Bixby, but maybe it'll actually be useful.

10:09AM: Smart reply is coming from Gmail. It's the handy feature you didn't use when you decided not to download (or at least actively use) Google Allo. Now you'll be able to use this quick reply feature to answer your emails.

10:08AM: ""This week, we've crossed over 2 billion active users on Android,"" said Sundar. But... there's always a but, computing is evolving again.

10:06AM: Sundar has taken the stage and immediately talking big numbers, in the billions, between users and YouTube views. Google Drive will be the next to break billion user breakthrough at 800+ million. ""The scale of these products are amazing,"" he said.

10:03AM: It's started. Right on time, we're now into the introduction video (a cute animated short) for the Google IO keynote, right before Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage.

09:48AM: There's a lot of work that goes into bringing you news and updates of live events like the Google IO keynote. These are just two of the people behind the madness, Michelle (left) and me, Matt Swider (right). We're psyched to be in Mountain View on the Google campus to bring you the latest announcements. Just minutes to go now.

09:34AM: We're less than 30 minutes from Google CEO Sundar Pichai taking the Google IO keynote stage, and we're hearing some amped up tunes with 'Audio powered by Android.' The techno music vibe technology goes with all of the gadgetry here in the audience.

08:54AM: We're one hour from our Google IO liveblog minute-by-minute updates and already seated in the outdoor Amphitheater. What are we hearing besides pop music blaring over the speakers? Rumors about a standalone VR headset. It's been talked about by the non-media audience. News travels quickly. What does that mean for Google Daydream ? Is it going to accelerate the growth of VR? We'll know very soon.

08:12AM: It's official. We're at Google IO 2017, and for all of the people who say ""Picture or it didn't happen,"" we've got that now.

We're huddled with the world's press at Google's Shoreline Amphitheater waiting to go into the keynote. It'll begin at 10AM on the dot.

12:00AM: We're kicking off our Google IO liveblog this morning in Mountain View, California, and we're in the company of thousands of Android fans

They have a reason to be excited. Google's May 17 keynote begins in 10 hours, and it'll usher in the future of Android software and hardware.

Google has turned IO into a developer-focused outdoor festival that celebrates coding and innovation as an art. And the Android community plays the artist.

There's definitely a start-up vibe to Google IO, but you're still going to hear a lot of big impact announcements straight from the Alphabet company.

We'll be covering all of the news here in real-time over the next several hours. Here's some background while we sleep.

Watch the Google IO livestream

Google IO liveblog start time

We're going to begin the Google IO 2017 liveblog around 7AM – and everything will be in Pacific Time. After all, we're in 'Google Country' right now.

The actual keynote begins at 10AM, with doors opening an hour in advance. That's usually how long it takes us to get Wi-Fi working properly – Google Wifi's mesh connection may help this year.

We'll provide minute-by-minute updates of what Google CEO Sundar Pichai says on stage and what your Android phone will look like (software-wise) in four months.

Google IO liveblog: what to expect

What's next for the Alphabet company? Over the next 12 to 24 months, your phone and speakers will get smarter, with Google rallying behind Assistant.

AI is driving all of the major players in tech, including Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook but Google's knowledge graph has so much data to work with.

Google Home is the company's budding AI speaker product, and we're likely to see how it'll answer the new Amazon Eco Show and its smart Alexa assistant.

Android O is a sure thing at Google IO. This is where Google likes to tease new features for its mobile operating system and the web.

Will we see Android Wear, Chromebook, car tech and lots of lots of VR tech. You can read more about from the link below.",techradar
10,Netflix is making a Witcher TV series,"A Netflix TV series based on the Witcher franchise is currently in development.

The announcement came from Platige Image, a Polish production and visual effects studio that has previously worked on cinematics for Total War: Warhammer 2, and a commercial for Huawei.

We started production of the series based on “The Witcher” in coop. with @NetflixUS and SeanDanielCompany. Tomek #Bagiński one of the dir! pic.twitter.com/hYXWCHySOFMay 17, 2017

The author of the Witcher books, Andrzej Sapkowski, will serve as the show's creative consultant. In the past Sapkowski has been dismissive of the games, which he considers to be nothing more than an alternative reading of his original world and characters.

Faithful to the books?

Sapkowski's involvement in the series suggests that the show might stick closer to the books than the games if his past comments are anything to go by.

Beyond the author, The Expanse's Sean Daniel and Jason Brown are on board as executive producers, and Tomek Baginski is directing, after having previously directed the games' intro cinematics.

In the past video games have proved challenging to adapt into movies, with last year's Assassin's Creed being another high profile disappointment. Hopefully the combination of a TV series being adapted from a game based on a book will prove more successful for Netflix, but the lack of big-name talent at this point is ringing alarm bells.",techradar
10,From bright white gadgets to boutique: how the cult of Apple is changing,"A small cross above the entrance to the newly-modernised Regent Street Apple Store is an emblem of the cathedral-like structure they’re now walking into, another demonstration of how Apple is moving further and further away from its days as a stereotypical electronics vendor.

Erica Robles-Anderson, a professor at New York University of media, culture and communication, dubbed Apple a cult when talking about the iconic nature of the brand , a description used multiple times in the media to describe the fervent following built up by Apple.

But now it’s no longer a term to describe those dedicated to the world of white curved plastic objects. Apple has long been trying to move away from that moment in its history, less a cult and more an emotional connection that’s backed up by substantive reasons to stick with brand and keep pouring money into the coffers.

The reasons behind the reboot are clear: Apple is aiming to make its stores boutique in nature, an aspirational place that’s less about the product and more about how it makes you feel and how you’ll be able to use it, inciting a feeling of endearment from the moment you’ve chosen to walk in to its stores.

But instead of the front-end to an electronics warehouse, the new stores are contrived to be seen as destinations, a place to meet and hang out that happens to be near products. It’s a wonder there’s not a coffee bar in there too.

The biggest stores - the ‘flagship’ ones, although Apple rarely calls them that - are being slowly redesigned with a large video wall that serves as a backdrop to live music, artists, talks and contextual advertising of the products.

Live talks in the Apple Store forums

It’s combined with the addition of Forums in these larger stores, a place where people can just hang out, with Apple attempting to engender a sense of community through events and providing breakout areas where people can come and learn more about the products.

On top of the Forum events, Today at Apple is a regular series of workshops and activities, and is also a big factor in the overhaul of Apple’s retail experience.

These allow anyone to book a class on filming video on an iPhone, learn more about creating music with an iPad Pro or even bring in large, more in-depth projects to work on quietly, with program specialists ready to help if you need to perform a specific function.

App developers and small businesses are invited down for discussions about their products and how Apple can better serve their needs.

Of course it’s a way to shift more devices or software to these companies and users, but Apple is investing a lot of money to make these experiences free and therefore more accessible in a bid to improve the connection people have to its devices.



Zagging instead of zigging

The reboot of its stores is an interesting move for Apple at a time where you could understand it shuttering some of its outlets. An iPhone sales drop of 16% in the first quarter of 2016 was followed by flat numbers for the same period this time around as momentum build to the much-vaunted iPhone 8 , and that’s alongside declining numbers of tablets and Macs and an uncertain number of Apple Watches sold.

The only real big upswing in revenue from its recent financial results was for services, with Apple Music and Pay providing a big boost to the brand’s coffers - and those are things that don’t need a physical outlet to show off.

Apple’s sales are rampant online, so you could argue it would be better served putting more products in large department stores and making them look shinier and more exciting at the point of sale, calling into question the need for dedicated retail outlets.

But according to eMarketer , Apple’s retail outlets made the most cash per square foot of any brand in the world in 2016, so clearly there’s still an appetite for a place to go and buy your new iThing.

And Apple is doubling down on that experience, pouring money into large-scale revamps of its stores in London, Dubai, Chicago and San Francisco among many others, and this week extending the Today at Apple scheme to all of its nearly-500 stores around the world.

The smaller venues won’t have the large video screens and as many regular events, but Apple wants them to be a focal point for the community, with programs like guided walks taking users around their city with professional photographers to learn more about how to use their devices.

It’s no coincidence that this overhaul is happening under the eye of Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail and online stores. She's the person who, as CEO, oversaw the rebirth of Burberry from its massively-counterfeited days back to a prominent, high-end fashion brand.

Angela Ahrendts promotes Today at Apple

She revamped the Burberry brand to respect and embrace the trend of online shopping, and brought that ethos into the physical bricks-and-mortar stores to create a destination.

A quick look at the modern Burberry flagship store down the road in from Apple's Regent Street store shows an easy blueprint: large video screen flanked by staircases, mirrors that come alive and iPads aplenty, rather similar to the layout of Apple’s new outlets.

With all these newly-modernised stores, Apple is no longer selling gadgets, but an experience. It’s a boutique that happens to sell tablets and phones. Luxury for the sake of being luxurious to evoke grandiose emotion when you walk in.

In San Francisco it’s the enormous, tailored glass sliding doors on the front of the building, floating glass staircases and lines on the floor, which match with the line of the iconic square in the foreground of the shop, that are so striking.

In London the building is filled with smooth carved stone, chosen and shipped in especially for this creation, used for the pillars and staircases that surround the space.

The solar wings at the new Dubai store

Dubai has solar wings on the front which cool the store in the heat but open to encourage users onto the terrace. A future Apple Store in Chicago is planned to open up a new space onto the waterfront in the same manner of encouraging people into the shop.

But while each new store has its own architectural identity, there are common themes among all of them. The trees that line the stores I visited in London and San Francisco have seats so Geniuses can sit next to customers under the foliage on seats - so specifically designed that they even have the same curvature as the iPhone.

Living walls of greenery adorn the inside of the Regent’s Street shop, and a 50-foot version lives at the Union Square store next to the public space Apple has created at the rear.

The large glass doors of the San Francisco Union Square store

Power sockets appear with the wave of a hand in the middle of the wooden table, and disappear equally quickly.

The rows beside the tables of products are now called Avenues, “inspired by the window displays along a boulevard that dynamically change with the season” as consumers walk past window dressings of accessories.

Even the temperature and lighting conditions are adapted throughout the day to match the outdoor conditions. ""It all starts with the storefront — taking transparency to a whole new level — where the building blends the inside and the outside, breaking down barriers and making it more egalitarian and accessible,” said Sir Jony Ive in a statement about the redesign of the Apple Store in San Francisco.

It’s Apple in the most Apple way possible, the hand of Ive obvious throughout the design ethos of the new stores. It’s a surprise that the brand hasn’t made an app that can follow you around the store, Sir Jony whispering his design ideas contextually as you wander through the space.

The new Apple outlets feel like the complete antithesis of 'normal' retail stores, where the goal is to throw as many products at your eyes as possible.

It’s hard to see your local vegetable stockist offering you the chance to walk the streets checking out new ways to eat your greens in the same way Apple is promoting local walks to learn how to use a phone camera more effectively.



On the ground

What Apple is trying to do is combine luxury with an actually enjoyable after-sales service.

I visited the Regent’s Street Store last weekend to try out one of the workshops, and the Apple employee who was leading my workshop quickly worked out that I knew how the camera on the iPhone functioned and started just chatting to me about how he was part of the Today at Apple program, without knowing I was writing anything on the subject.

He suggested some other workshops I might like while still making sure I had all the basics of the phone down, and wrapped up the session early when we’d reached the end of what was needed.

I then headed down to the Forum in front of the large screen and got chatting to the girl who was sketching using the iPad Pro, with the impressive results on the video wall behind us.

Activities in the Forum at Regent's Street

Around me people were video chatting or talking to Apple Store employees about products on small wooden stools, and at no point was I approached to be forced to buy anything.

As a consumer, it’d be hard not to be impressed by the lack of sales push and the amount of information and help on offer for free, despite it being a busy Saturday in the store.

What was impressive was how much each store worker knew about the place. Where in other phone shops I’ve been told all manner of hastily made-up nonsense from bored weekend workers, those I spoke to at the Apple Store knew things like why the seats were designed in a certain way and seemed to relish the roles they held.

And Apple seems to have finally fixed one of the bigger issues with 'Today at Apple' - how hard it is to find out what's going on. With the launch around the world, it's created a dedicated site to let you know what's going on near you, rather than having to delve through the store's website.

It's mostly workshops with a few events thrown in, and hopefully Apple will begin promoting it better in-store so people know about it, but if the brand is going to make this aftercare an integral part of the store experience, it needs to let people know about it.



Apple for the future

For those that pointedly dislike Apple as a brand, these Store revamps are going to do nothing to bring them into the fold. But for the thousands who have already bought an iPhone, Macbook or iPad, there are real and genuine reasons to come back into the store and not even look at newer things to buy.

Apple wants to reiterate that its products and services are a complete package, a way of life to be aspired to that you don’t get when you’re walking past rows of discounted TVs.

It no longer wants the latest iPhone to get you into the store, but the entertainment that draws you in as you walk past.

Instead of focusing on pushing people to purchase instantly, Apple is playing the long game with its new stores. It’s trying to create an atmosphere, rather than products, that people want to browse, which is why it’s trying to associate the boulevards of Paris with a corridor to walk down beside a table.

Will it be the shot in the arm to iPhone sales Apple wants? Probably not - if that happens it won’t be anything to do with whether you can buy an iPhone 8 directly nearby.

But by re-imagining itself as a luxury boutique brand Apple is trying to create (or strengthen) an emotional connection to the products, a chance to renew customer’s ties to the company and increase the trust in its services, keeping them buying new Apple gadgets and plans for years to come.",techradar

10,HTC U11 review,"A powerful performer with a genuine attempt at innovation... but we're not convinced HTC's squeezy sides offer enough to mark this phone out.

The HTC U11 is a very different phone to others on the market.

It’s the result of HTC needing to do something big to convince you that it’s the phone you should buy over the Samsung Galaxy S8 or forthcoming iPhone 8 - and it believes that a squeezable phone is the way to do that.

You read that right: a squeezable phone. The device itself doesn’t actually flex, but you can apply pressure to the sides of the U11 to activate different apps and functions.

It’s all part of HTC’s desire to find a way to innovate with a high-spec black rectangle, trying to reimagine the way we use our smartphones.

The HTC U11 is more than that though - it’s an incredibly powerful handset with a list of specs, one that will have any tech fan salivating, packaged together in an all-new design language for 2017, offering brilliant audio, apparently the world's best smartphone camera and will even offer Alexa integration (eventually).

In a rush? Check out our HTC U11 hands on video below



HTC U11 release date and price

The new HTC phone will be available in some territories from May 18 and will be available in the UK from June, with a worldwide release program (we’ll update this piece with more specific information in the coming weeks as we find out definite dates from regions).

In terms of price, it's set for the same as last year's HTC 10, which began life costing £649, and will be the same for the U11. (Likely around $700 / AU£900 unlocked).

The desire to bring something different from HTC clearly has come at a cost, and while the price is a clear indication of the amount of tech stuffed into the HTC U11, it's still a lot to swallow for the average consumer... and the squeezy sides will really have to impress to give a good enough impression at that cost.



Design and display

Before we talk about the innovative Edge Sense user interface (which is what HTC is calling the ability to squeeze the phone) let’s talk about the design of the U11, as it’s pretty striking.

It’s based on HTC’s new Liquid Surface design language, seen in the HTC U Play and U Ultra, and features ultra-strong Gorilla Glass 5 bent to create a rolling chassis that’s full of curves.

There are five options in terms of your choice of HTC U11 color: Solar Red (easily the most impressive), Amazing Silver, Brilliant Black, Sapphire Blue and Ice White.

Each has a two-tone effect, but despite the fact this is a glass-covered phone (with a metal strip holding the two front and back pieces together) it lacks the premium finish of an all-metal device.

If anything, this phone feels more like polycarbonate or plastic than premium glass, but that does make it pretty light.

It’s going to be a pretty subjective design, with some people loathing the plastic, curved look and some loving the two-tone pearlescent sheen.

In the hand it feels a little bulbous compared to other smartphones on the market thanks to the rolling design, and the glass does have a plastic texture (thanks to being so thin) but it doesn’t feel cheap.

However, the HTC U11 will munch up your fingerprints in an instant, the shiny design ruined within a few seconds of fondling. Thankfully it all wipes off pretty easily, but it’s not anywhere as attractive as an all-metal body when it comes to staying shiny.

It's only fair here to reiterate that this isn't just a glass-phone-that-looks-plastic. The combination of colors within the glass, as well as the effort gone into making it rounded, is impressive, but it doesn't feel as premium as the metal of last year still.

The display is a 5.5-inch QHD affair, but it's not the longer 18:9 ratio that's been seen on other flagship phones from Samsung and LG. The Super LCD 5 tech used is clear and sharp, and while it lacks the pop of Super AMOLED found on Samsung's phones, it still looks natural and vibrant at the right times.

There's a danger that HTC is getting left behind by not adopting the new wider format - as it looks impressive - but the brand told us that it wanted to make sure that the industry adopts the new screen standard before making the jump.



Edge Sense and Alexa

HTC has decided it’s time to upgrade its user interface again, and while it’s not changed the look of it too much, the way you can get involved with the phone has altered massively.

That’s because Edge Sense lets you squeeze both sides of the phone - on the bottom half of the handset - and interact with what’s on screen.

A short squeeze will open the camera, a long one Google Assistant, but this can be customised. You can choose apps to open, start the torch or begin and end an audio recording.

It’s an interesting way of doing things, but one that sounds better than it works in real life, at least in our early testing.

The issue is that even at the lowest pressure levels you’re still required to put a fair amount of forced into the phone to make sure you’ve activated the Edge Sense interaction, so it doesn’t feel as intuitive as it could.

That said, it does feel like a system that you’ll need to learn over time and become familiar with, so it’s not really fair to rate it fully in our hour or so with the U11.

But it feels like a shame there’s no tactile feedback on how hard you’re squeezing other than a slight buzz when you press in to the necessary level of force… we’re looking for a phone that has a level of physical depression, rather than a squeeze-and-hope.

The thing that’s going to kick the U11 into overdrive when it comes to user interaction (yeah, exciting stuff) is the ability to map that squeeze to any function within the phone.

This will likely mean you can reconfigure the squeeze to do different things in different apps - which would be handy, but has yet to be properly confirmed so it's only what we can assume.

We say assume, because the function still isn’t enabled despite the phone’s imminent launch - in fact, you won’t get that ability until July of this year for some reason.

The other thing you won’t be able to play with until then is Alexa - Amazon’s voice assistant will be packed into the mix for HTC’s new phone… despite Google Assistant being on board.

The assumption is that HTC believes Alexa to be the superior voice assistant, the popularity of the Echo making it a feature to have on the phone.

However, it’ll be interesting to see whether Alexa is the equal of Google Assistant on the device… apart from being able to order things for you, it’s hard to see where the genuine need for another voice assistant resides.

Alexa's presence appears to be a tacit admission from a major tech player that Amazon is winning the war of the voice assistants, something that's likely to not endear HTC to Google.

The rest of the HTC interface is as predicable as before… it doesn’t offer anything new compared to the competition, relying on Google’s suite of apps rather than its own options to perform functions.

That’s fine, and having everything backed up to the cloud can be a godsend at times, but it does mean that sometimes when you just want to see a photo - and need to open Google Photos to do so - it can take a little longer than expected.



Camera

The HTC U11 camera isn’t hugely upgraded from last year, with a 12MP sensor that can shoot in RAW (and likely relies on that mode to get the best images).

However, there are some tweaks and impressive performances we noted in the testing, with the new HDR Boost mode really adding to the flavor of snaps.

The low light performance, thanks to the new f/1.7 aperture, seemed to be excellent as well, with some very gloomy situations coming out bright and clear with a single snap.

The speed of the camera’s operation isn’t brilliant from sleeping - it can take a second between pressing the shutter button and the picture taking to get the snap, which is something that has been noted for HTC phones in the past.

Turning off the HDR mode does seem to improve this, but it’s confusingly not as snappy as the Google Pixel… which has an older processor and was also manufactured by HTC.

However, this could be one of the best smartphone cameras on the market, if the new DxOMark score of 90 (the best achieved by a smartphone) is anything to go by. We're always wary on basing predictions of future performance on these scores though, as it doesn't always translate to brilliant real world performance.

What it does mean is that HTC has created, once again, a technically very able camera, and with the new 0.3 second autofocus on board, combined with the HDR capabilities, it should mean some great snaps if you're willing to work for them.

The front-facing camera packs in more pixels, moving up to a 16MP sensor, and offers the HTC panorama mode for selfies, where you twist the phone left and right to capture more of your chums in that photo that lets everybody know where you were, and 150-degree image capture to let in more info.

Will this be the best camera in the world? The slower shutter speed doesn't bode too well, but given we only spent time with a preview sample, this could be fixed before it reaches the market, so the upgrades could come to solve things.

If there’s not a raft of changes, then again you’ll have a snapper that’s technically very adept - the HTC 10 would take brilliant pictures if you went into manual mode, selected the RAW method of capture and enhanced each snap - but not the greatest point and shoot option on the market.



Audio

We’re pretty excited to see what HTC is offering with the audio prowess on the U11, as it’s got literally every feature most will be looking for in a good phone for music.

The first - and most important one - comes with the headphones. The new U Sonic headphones - already among the best we’ve ever seen bundled in the box with a phone - have been upgraded again to include active noise cancellation, so you’ll get unparalleled quality booming into your ears.

On top of that there’s the ability to have the HTC U11 map your inner ear sonically, allowing the phone to build a picture of how you can hear sound and altering the output accordingly to make it a tailored audio experience.

The HTC U11 uses USB Type-C as a connector at the bottom - and there’s no headphone jack, in a move that feels less courageous than one of a brand feeling empowered by Apple to lose the port.

However, HTC has done everything it can to make up for the loss by including a rather robust 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor… with a digital audio converter in it.

This made the sound quality insane coming out of the HTC U11, with a pair of Sony headphones offering sublime audio quality from a very basic audio file.

If you’re more of an audiophile, the HTC U11 continues the brand’s support of Hi-Res Audio files, so you’ll be able to get the full experience from anything you throw on the phone.

And if you’re not into headphones, then HTC’s iconic Boomsound is back as well… although still not in the dual front-facing speaker configuration we’ve enjoyed in the past.

Holding the phone in the hand, the sound is pretty good. The treble and bass is separated out between the two speakers top and bottom, and while it irks that part of the sound is firing away from you, it’s still loud.

However, place it on a table and the effect is rather magnified, with HTC claiming to use more of the phone as a resonance chamber to improve performance.

It’s not perfect, and we miss the days of dual speakers pumping forward, but it’s a decent enough way to watch YouTube.



Battery

We’ve always been a little worried about the way HTC approaches battery life, as while it’s generally been OK, the performance has never been stellar.

That’s partly because the brand insists on sacrificing battery size over design, and once again its new phone doesn’t lead the industry in terms of power pack performance, with the HTC U11 packed with a 3000mAh battery.

That shouldn’t be too bad - after all, it’s the same that Samsung has in the Galaxy S8 - but HTC’s battery management is always something of a worry, the daily performance being on the ‘slippy’ side.

Compare that to other phones coming out at the moment - with the OnePlus 5, for instance, rumored to have a 4000mAh battery pack - and it’s hard to see why HTC won’t finally just go all in on a larger, better-optimised power unit.

There’s no wireless charging on offer either, with HTC’s Darren Sng telling us that it’s ‘not convenient’ enough thanks to the slower charging speeds on offer - but in reality, it’s a conscious design decision, one where less cash is spent on designing a more streamlined phone.

Is it necessary? No, but it would have been a nice option to have for some. Almost convenient.



Early verdict

When it comes to worldwide market share, the words ‘HTC’ and ‘tailspin’ have been bandied about by the media for a while now and that description has always felt a little unfair to the brand.

It’s been consistently making excellent handsets for years (perhaps the HTC One M9 aside…) but with a poorer marketing strategy and nothing to really define it apart from the rest of the industry its excellent design and elements of innovation haven’t been enough.

That’s how it feels with the HTC U11… in a vacuum, this is an excellent handset. The Liquid Surface design is subjective but certainly striking, and it’s hard to ask for more on the spec sheet, apart from possibly a bigger battery.

And if you’re into audio, it’s hard to recommend any other handset beyond the HTC U11 - the amount of effort the brand has put in is amazing here.

But it’s in the headline feature that the worry lives. This phone is going to be sold on the ability to squeeze it, and while that’s a feature that needs a lot more testing, the early time we’ve spent with it has left us unconvinced.

This is one of the more intriguing phones of 2017, and one we’re genuinely excited to try out in a full review to find out whether the higher price, strong spec sheet and new method of interaction fuse together into something that will break the magnetic pull Samsung and Apple enjoy in the smartphone world.",techradar
3,Immigration arrests up 38% nationwide under Trump,"Police arrest a protester outside of the Elizabeth Detention Center during a rally denouncing President Trump's deportation practices on February 23, 2017, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)

In the 100 days since President Trump signed an executive order to enhance immigration enforcement, the arrests of undocumented immigrants is up 38% from the same time period in 2016, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data released Wednesday.

ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan said his agency is focusing on undocumented immigrants with criminal records, the ""bad hombres"" that Trump spoke about throughout his presidential campaign. But the data show that the biggest jump in arrests involved undocumented immigrants without a criminal record, a 156% increase from last year.

Between Jan. 22 and April 29, ICE arrested 10,845 people whose immigration violations were the only marks on their record. That's nearly triple the 4,242 people arrested during the same time period in President Barack Obama's final year in office.

Of all the people arrested by ICE this year, nearly 75% had a criminal record. In Obama's final year in office, 92% of people arrested by ICE in the country had a criminal record.

""I get asked a lot why we arrest somebody that’s not a criminal,"" Homan said. ""Those who do enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act.""

Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a group that advocates for immigrants, said Trump's public comments about going after the most dangerous immigrants were a diversion from his goal: mass deportations.

""If we don't call it out and stand up to it, America is moving in the direction of committing a mistake of historic proportions — driving millions of immigrants who are deeply rooted in our country out of the country they now call home,"" Sharry said.

ICE agents have been able to arrest more non-criminals due to an executive order Trump signed on Jan. 25. In that order, the president expanded the pool of undocumented immigrants considered ""priorities"" for deportation.

Under Obama, undocumented immigrants had to be a gang member, convicted of a felony, or convicted of several misdemeanors to be deemed a deportation priority. Under Trump, undocumented immigrants simply have to be arrested for a crime — not convicted — to become a priority. Trump also allowed ICE agents to focus on undocumented immigrants who they deem to be a ""risk to public safety or national security.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly further expanded the powers of ICE agents through new directives in February.

Under Obama, ICE agents who were conducting raids or seeking specific individuals could generally not arrest other undocumented immigrants they encountered along the way. For example, if an ICE officer entered a home looking for an undocumented immigrant with a violent record, they would not arrest other people found in the home.

Kelly's order changed that. Now, ICE agents are allowed to round up anybody they encounter and arrest them if they're in the country illegally, which has driven up the number of non-criminals arrested by the agency.

On Wednesday, Homan emphasized all undocumented immigrants will still receive their day in court and be able to fight back against their removal.

""All of those arrested will receive the due process afforded to them under the law,"" Homan said. ""We are a nation of laws, and ignoring orders issued by federal judges undermines our constitutional government.""

ICE did see a drop in one area: deportations.

Homan said the agency removed 56,315 people from the U.S. in that time period, a 12% drop from the same period in 2016. He said that was due to a backlog in immigration courts, the time-consuming nature of deportations of undocumented immigrants living in the country and a drop in people caught crossing the southwest border, which often leads to quick deportations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he is ready to provide the U.S. Senate with a transcript of last week's controversial Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov that is at the center of allegations that Trump revealed highly classified information.

""If the U.S. administration considers it possible, we are ready to submit a transcript of Lavrov’s talk with Trump to the U.S. Senate and Congress, if, of course, the U.S. administration would want this,"" Putin said, according to the Russian-owned Tass news agency.

Putin's comments came during a joint news conference in the Black Sea resort of Sochi with visiting Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.

Trump has come under fire following news reports that he shared sensitive intelligence about an Islamic State plot with Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak during a meeting at the White House.

At one point, Putin jokingly said he needed to upbraid Lavrov for failing to share the ""secrets"" with him.

""I will have to reprimand him because he shared these secrets neither with me nor with the Russian secret services which is very inappropriate on his part,"" Putin joked, according to the Russian Interfax news agency.

Putin said he had “no other explanation” as to why Trump has come under attack over the alleged incident other than “political schizophrenia,” according to Interfax.

The Russian president said he initially found debates about Russia’s meddling in U.S. politics “funny,” but said Moscow is now “concerned because it’s hard to imagine what the people who produce such nonsense can come up with next.”

He dismissed U.S. politicians — unnamed — as either being “stupid” or “dangerous and unscrupulous” who are wittingly “causing the damage to their own country.”

Asked what he thinks of the Trump presidency, Putin said it’s up to the American people to judge but that his performance can be rated “only when he’s allowed to work at full capacity,” implying that someone is hampering Trump’s efforts.

The White House on Tuesday defended Trump discussing with the Russians an Islamic State group terror threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft.

Speaking to Russian news agencies on Wednesday Yuri Ushakov, a Putin aide, earlier would not comment on the contents of last week’s talks among Trump, Lavrov and Kislyak.

Ushakov said “any contacts” with the U.S. president are “important” but he would not reply to the question whether the classified information that Trump reportedly shared with Lavrov and Kislyak was valuable for Russia.

U.S. Homeland Security officials met with their European Union counterparts Wednesday in Brussels to lay out plans for banning laptops and tablets from the cabins of trans-Atlantic flights amid warnings of a resulting ""economic tsunami.""

The controversial proposal would expand the ban established in March for in-flight laptops and other large electronics for U.S.-bound flights from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and Africa. The expansion involves routes carrying up to 65 million people annually on more than 400 daily flights, DHS says.

DHS spokesman Dave Lapan said the timetable for rolling out the prohibition was not altered by President Trump sharing with Russian officials classified information last week relating to the security threat posed by laptops on planes. EU officials say they have not been briefed on the threat, the Associated Press reported.

The goal of Wednesday’s talks is to improve information sharing between the U.S. and EU related to security threats, an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing, told AP.

Read more:

DHS Secretary John Kelly has not made a final decision on the ban, which has drawn fire from travel associations and even British airline pilots.

""The ripple effects of this could create an economic tsunami of the likes of which terrorists are dreaming of but instead it would be at the hand of government directive,"" Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the U.S.-based Business Travel Coalition, wrote in a letter to EU Council Chairwoman Violeta Bulc.

​The International Air Transport Association, which represents 265 airlines, estimated the ban would cost more than $1 billion in lost time to passengers.

U.S. security officials said in March the measure was adopted in response to two events: a bomb in a soda can suspected of destroying a Russian Metrojet above Egypt in October 2015 and a laptop suspected of blowing a hole in the side of a Daallo Airlines flight in Somalia in February 2016.

Checked baggage poses less of a threat because a bomb would need a sophisticated timer, says Jeffrey Price, who writes about aviation security as a professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver. Additionally, cargo luggage generally faces more stringent security checks than carry-ons, and a bomb in cargo would need to be more powerful than a bomb in the cabin, experts say.

The British Airline Pilots’ Association dissent was based on safety, however. The pilots issued a statement saying the risk arising from storing electronic devices in the hold where they may catch fire without being noticed could be greater than the security risk of having them in the cabin.

""Lithium battery fires, unless caught early, can spread quickly,"" the statement said. “If these devices are kept in the hold, the risk is that if a fire occurs the results can be catastrophic; indeed, there have been two crashes where lithium batteries have been cited in the accident reports.""

6,Texas Rep. Al Green calls for President Trump's impeachment on House floor,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Texas Rep. Al Green called for President Trump's impeachment on the House floor on Wednesday. Time

In a fiery speech on the House floor, Rep. Al Green called for President Trump's impeachment on Wednesday morning.

""It's a position of conscience for me,"" the Texas Democrat said. ""This is about what I believe. And this is where I stand. I will not be moved. The president must be impeached.""

Noting that no one – including the president – is above the law, he called on the American people to let their members of Congress know where they stood. He also said members of Congress had to ""make their own decisions"" on where they stood about the issue.

Green became the first Democrat in Congress to start calling for impeachment earlier this week, prior to news breaking that the president reportedly disclosed classified information to Russian officials – and before President Trump asked James Comey to drop the FBI probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, at least according to memos from the now-fired FBI director.

But Green ramped up his call on Wednesday, amid an onslaught of criticism from lawmakers about the president's recent actions.

""This is not to be taken lightly,"" he said. I think this is one of the highest callings that a member of Congress can address.""

Rep. Al Green calls for Trump's impeachment: 'No one is above the law and that includes the president' pic.twitter.com/Ayh4AqJ7Bp — Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) May 17, 2017

While many in the Democratic party, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, are still hesitant to start talking about such proceedings, Green wasn't the only Democrat this week throwing the term around this week.

Rep. Maxine Waters of California said during Tuesday's Center for American Progress convention that Democrats shouldn't be afraid to use the word.

""I don’t know what’s going to happen after today, when all of the questions have been raised about him… but I think this is going to put us a little bit further on our way to what I have been calling for for so long, and that is impeachment,"" Water said, per a Buzzfeed report.

Still, many other Democrats are wary.

“It’s not something I believe people should wish for,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe into Russian interference in the presidential election. ""We should undertake our constitutional obligation to take the evidence, follow the evidence. And if there’s another constitutional obligation that follows from that, there is.. They’re allegations that were in a newspaper report, but they’re also allegations that are easily subject to proof.""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said, he wanted to get information and wasn't ""there yet"" on impeachment.

""Will it lead to impeachment? I don’t know, but one thing is for sure this is a critical moment,"" he said.

16,Household debt tops 2008 peak ahead of financial crisis,"Mortgages make up a lower share of household debt and in 2008. (Photo: Michael Dwyer, AP)

U.S. household debt has topped the record level reached in 2008, a milestone for the recovery that shows consumers are borrowing again,

But while the debt doesn’t pose the risks that toppled the financial system nine years ago, there are still some signs of potential trouble, notably high student loan debt and delinquencies.

Debt balances for American households increased $149 billion, or 1.2%, in the first quarter to $12.73 trillion, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Wednesday. That’s modestly above the $12.68 trillion peak in 2008 and 14.1% higher than the bottom in 2013.

But the makeup of that debt is starkly different than it was at the brink of the 2008 financial crisis. While mortgages still comprise the majority of the obligations, they represent a far lower share and the rebound has been led by student and auto debt.

More on student loan debt:

4 ways to pay down student debt (while staying sane)

How to save money on student loan repayments

“The debt and its borrowers look quite different today,” said Donghoon Lee, the New York Fed’s research officer.

Also, household debt represented nearly 100% of personal income in 2008, compared with 80% today, presenting a far lower risk to individual solvency and the broader economy, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.

The latest milestone is “a good thing,” Zandi said. “People need credit to do the things they want to do -- home improvement, start a business. You want credit to flow freely but consistent with people’s ability to repay.”

Related:

In the mid-2000s, lenders too easily doled out all types of loans, but particularly mortgages, fueling housing and credit bubbles that ultimately collapsed. Households shed more than $1.5 trillion in debt, most of it housing-related and partly through foreclosures.

In the first quarter, outstanding mortgage debt increased $147 billion as mortgage originations grew by $491 billion. By comparison, quarterly mortgage originations were averaging about $650 billion during the housing bubble before plunging to less than $300 billion four years ago.

Student loan debt rose by $34 billion to $1.34 trillion and was up from about $500 billion in 2007, trailing only mortgages. Many Americans stayed in school longer or returned to college to beef up their skills when jobs were scarce in the recession.

Auto loan debt increased by $10 billion to $1.17 trillion and has climbed steadily since the downturn amid low interest rates and dealer incentives. And credit card debt fell by $15 billion to $764 billion.

Total delinquency was flat last quarter at 4.8%, the lowest level since before the recession. But there were some areas of concern. Eleven percent of student loan debt was at least 90 days delinquent, a figure the New York Fed said has remained stubbornly high.

And auto loan and credit card debt have edged higher, with auto debt that’s at least 90 days delinquent rising to 7.5% from 7.1% during the first three months of the year. Lenders have responded by tightening credit standards, a development that Zandi said makes him less worried about the risk of an auto loan crisis that traces the housing bust.

“Balances are increasingly shifting towards more creditworthy and older borrowers,” New York Fed officials wrote in a blog post.

4,Are You Face-Blind?,"Have you ever had a friend totally blank you even though you were sure they looked right at your face?

Maybe they didn't actually see you, maybe they secretly hate you, or maybe they have something called prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness.

Prosopagnosia is a cognitive disorder that means some people struggle to recognise faces – sometimes even those of people they know very well (including themselves!).

""You often hear the phrasing 'I'm really bad with names', but when you think about it, being bad with names is actually having difficulty putting a name to a face,"" says Dr Punit Shah, a psychology lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University. ""Everyone has this to some extent, nobody's perfect, but some people seem particularly bad at being able to do this, and that seems to be what prosopagnosia is.""

Around 1 in 50 people in the UK have it. Most cases are developmental, which means people are born with or develop this inability to recognise faces, rather than acquiring it after an accident.

People with face blindness tend to come up with coping mechanisms – relying on someone's voice, their clothes, or something else to work out who they are.

To be properly diagnosed with face blindness involves an in-depth face recognition test. But Shah and his colleagues have come up with a 20 question test that he says provides a good indication of someone's ability to recognise faces. Their test was published today in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.",buzzfeed

9,3 NBA Draft trades we’d like to see now that the order is set | FOX Sports,"Celtics trade the No. 1 pick in a package for an All-Star

The Celtics were active at the trade deadline in talks with both the Bulls for Jimmy Butler and with the Pacers for Paul George, but the asking prices at the time were deemed to be far too steep. The front office in Boston liked what it saw from the team's core players, and the Celtics were clearly right to keep things together, as proven by the fact that the Celtics finished the regular season with the best record in the East.

There's a theory, however, that Danny Ainge is hesitant to use any of his precious assets to continue to build the team as long as LeBron James is at the height of his powers. He's got to slow down at some point, the thinking goes, and there's no point in wasting future draft picks or locking up salary-cap space if the Cavaliers (or whatever team James chooses to play for) continue to run roughshod in the East.

But if Boston is ever going to make a move, the time is now. Isaiah Thomas is 28, and Al Horford will be 31 in less than three weeeks. Just how competitive Boston can be against Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals may go a long way in helping Ainge to make his decision, but a team with title aspirations doesn't need the No. 1 pick in a draft where no transcendent players appear to be on the board.

Go get Jimmy Butler or Paul George, or see if Gordon Hayward might opt into the final year of his deal with Utah to accept a trade to come play with Brad Stevens, his former college coach. One more star would make the Celtics a legitimate title contender, and remember: even if things don't work as planned, Boston gets Brooklyn's 2018 first-round pick too, which could very well end up No. 1 overall for a second straight season.",fox-sports

9,Mark Cuban says Mavericks tried to lose after they were eliminated from playoffs | FOX Sports,"NBA fans are well aware that teams tank to improve their draft lottery position, but it’s a rare moment when they openly admit to it.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban did exactly that on Wednesday’s “Dan Patrick Show.”

“Once we were eliminated from the playoffs, we did everything we could to lose games,” said Cuban, who then explained how his team did it.

“You play all your young players.”

""Once we were eliminated from the #playoffs we did everything possible to lose games.""-@mcuban on the @dallasmavs tanking pic.twitter.com/YRGnncqboE — Dan Patrick Show (@dpshow) May 17, 2017

But it’s not as though Cuban told coach Rick Carlisle and his players to lose games on purpose – that would never work given the competitive nature of NBA players, Cuban said.

“Once a guy walks on the court, they’re going to play their heart out. Particularly the young guys because they have something to prove. Dorian Finney-Smith, Yogi Ferrell, there’s nothing you could say or do to them to say. ‘Don’t play hard or try to lose this game.’ That wouldn’t be right, and I don’t think any NBA team would ever do that.”

So how did it work out? The Mavericks were eliminated from the playoffs April 1 and lost five of their last seven games after that to finish the season 33-49. They had lost four straight and eight of 11 games before that, so the difference wasn’t all that noticeable.

9,Dana White and Luke Rockhold engage in bitter war of words over Twitter | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White and former middleweight champion Luke Rockhold clearly don’t see eye to eye on a number of issues and the tension boiled over in a series of messages exchanged on Twitter.

It all started with White responding to Rockhold over this past weekend at UFC 211 when he admonished the former champion for his criticism about Georges St-Pierre receiving a middleweight title shot while more worthy contenders were waiting in the wings.

White took exception to Rockhold voicing his opinion about possibly competing for an interim title while taking aim at him for not fighting since suffering a first round knockout to Michael Bisping last June.

On Tuesday, Rockhold took to Twitter where he fired back at the UFC president while explaining that he wasn’t saying that he deserved a shot at the title while also blasting his boss for putting St-Pierre in a position to fight for a title in a division where he’s never competed before.

“I never said I deserved a title shot. I said we (middleweights) deserve clarity. We deserve something to fight for,” Rockhold wrote.

“You have to earn your way in this company? Tell me how did GSP earn a middleweight title shot? Think before you run your mouth.”

@danawhite I never said I deserved a title shot. I said we (middleweights) deserve clarity. We deserve something to fight for. — Luke Rockhold (@LukeRockhold) May 16, 2017

@danawhite ""You have to earn your way in this company""? Tell me how did GSP earn a middleweight title shot? Think before you run your mouth — Luke Rockhold (@LukeRockhold) May 16, 2017

The strong words from Rockhold finally prompted a response from White, who fired back at the former champion while also taking a shot at him in the process.

“I usually never respond but GSP never lost his title. Bisping, GSP and the fans wanted it,” White wrote. “Stick to fighting and modeling and leave the matchmaking to us.”

Rockhold didn’t offer another response following White’s message on Twitter.

Clearly these two remain at odds over the status of the middleweight division, although White has recently said that No. 1 contender Yoel Romero will get the next shot at the title after he scrapped plans for the fight with Bisping.

As for Rockhold, he still hasn’t been booked for his next fight as he approaches one year out of action since his last bout in June 2016.",fox-sports
6,Special counsel appointed in Russia probe,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department on Wednesday appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, including potential collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign associates and Russian officials.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to the position in a letter obtained by CNN. Attorney General Jeff Sessions previously recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation due to his role as a prominent campaign adviser and surrogate.

As special counsel, Mueller is ""authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,"" according to the Justice Department order Rosenstein signed.

Mueller's appointment aims to quell the wave of criticism that Trump and his administration have faced since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week in the middle of the FBI's intensifying investigation into contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials.

In a statement, Trump said an investigation will confirm that ""there was no collusion"" between his campaign and Russia.

""As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know -- there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity. I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.""

In a brief statement, Mueller said, ""I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability.""

News of the special counsel announcement was closely held. The White House received a heads-up less than an hour before the news broke at 6 p.m. ET. House Speaker Paul Ryan and key congressional leaders also were not notified.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said the appointment was needed.

""I think it was the right thing to do and I believe they saw it as the right thing to do otherwise they're going to have a fight and it's not worth the fight,"" Feinstein said. ""There (is) mutual suspicion of one side and the other. This clears that up and has a person whose reputation is as good as it gets and he'll be very good.""

White House didn't want special counsel

Calls for a special counsel or prosecutor were rising after The Washington Post and then CNN reported on excerpts of a memo Comey wrote in February, in which Comey wrote that Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Demands intensified from Democrats on Capitol Hill for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel or prosecutor to oversee the case. Republicans on Tuesday night began to join those calls.

Trump was meeting with FBI director candidates when the White House was formally told that a special prosecutor had been named in Russia investigation. The White House counsel informed the president.

""It's still sinking in,"" one administration official said, describing an air of uncertainty in the West Wing. ""We were told about it. Not asked about it.""

White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday dismissed the idea of a special prosecutor.

""There's, frankly, no need for a special prosecutor. We've discussed this before,"" Spicer told reporters. ""You have two Senate committees that are looking into this, the FBI is conducting their own review. And -- and I think if you even look at what Acting Director (Andrew) McCabe said last week, he made it very clear that they have the resources that they need and that the work continues.""

Beyond allegedly asking Comey to quit his investigation into Flynn -- who has been a central focus of the FBI's investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russia -- Trump said in an interview with NBC last week that he considered the ""Russia thing with Trump and Russia' when he decided to fire Comey.

Trump has called the FBI investigation into Russia a ""hoax"" and ""taxpayer funded charade.""

Rushed to Ashcroft's hospital room with Comey

The appointment could be seen as a signal from Rosenstein. His independence was quickly praised as news of his appointment spread, with many recalling his famous refusal to bow to the demands of West Wing officials during the Bush administration.

When George W. Bush's White House chief of staff and White House counsel sought to get an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a warrantless domestic surveillance program that the Justice Department had ruled illegal, Mueller and Comey rushed to the hospital to prevent the Bush officials from taking advantage of Ashcroft.

Comey made it there first, but as Mueller rushed to the hospital he called Ashcroft's security detail and ordered them to prevent the top Bush officials from kicking Comey out of the room.

Mueller later threatened to resign alongside Comey, who was then serving as deputy attorney general, over Bush administration officials' continued attempts to reauthorize the program. They ultimately did not resign as Bush sided with the Justice Department officials.

'Necessary' for 'full confidence' in investigation

Rosenstein said he believes a special counsel ""is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome.""

""In my capacity as acting attorney general, I determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a Special Counsel to assume responsibility for this matter,"" Rosenstein said in a statement, adding that the decision is ""not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.""

""What I have determined is that based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command,"" Rosenstein said.

Mueller was appointed FBI Director by President George W. Bush in 2001 and served until 2013, when Comey took over as head. He will resign from his private law firm WilmerHale to avoid any conflicts of interest, the Justice Department said.

6,Who is Robert Mueller?,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department on Wednesday named Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The former FBI director has a long history with investigations and prosecutions.

Mueller was former FBI director James Comey's predecessor. President Donald Trump fired Comey last week.

The longtime litigator was the second-longest FBI director in history, only behind iconic and controversial director J. Edgar Hoover. Congress passed legislation in 2011 to extend Mueller's term from the usual 10 years, giving him a 12-year tenure.

Mueller oversaw the FBI from September 4, 2001, just days before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, until September 4, 2013.

Mueller is widely seen as a nonpolitical, dogged investigator, respected on both sides of the aisle. The extension of his term passed the Senate 100-0, and he was also initially confirmed in 2001 unanimously, 98-0.

Philip Mudd, a CNN contributor and former deputy director of the FBI's national security branch under Mueller, praised the appointment to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.

""Every American who thinks that this is a moment of turmoil, whether they like the President or not, should breathe easy tonight: Robert Muller is solid ground,"" Mudd said.

""He is not one of the best, Robert Mueller, he is the best I ever saw. Leadership, judgment, decision-making,"" he added. ""There is nobody better at doggedly pursuing a target without being subjected to any pressures from Congress, the President, the media, anybody in the FBI, the attorney general, the deputy attorney general. There is nobody better.""

Atop the FBI, Mueller saw the bureau through a time of tremendous change in a post-9/11 world. His tenure saw the rise of al Qaeda as a threat, the vast expansion of US surveillance capabilities and an increase in the threat from home-grown terrorism. Mueller reflected on the changes in an exit interview with CNN in 2013, saying the intelligence collection capabilities the US built since 9/11 could possibly have stopped part of the attacks.

Mueller also was part of another famous incident with Comey -- a dramatic 2004 dispute over the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program.

Comey was serving as acting attorney general as then-Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized. Comey refused to reauthorize the controversial Bush administration program over concerns about the legality of the surveillance.

The White House counsel and chief of staff rushed to the hospital to attempt to get Ashcroft to sign the reauthorization -- and Comey rushed to stop them, though the program was eventually reauthorized without Justice Department approval. Mueller's notes backed up Comey's account when the incident was revealed three years later, and Mueller joined Comey in threatening to resign in 2004 if the program was not overhauled.

Mueller's FBI stint capped a long career working in law, including breaking ground.

After decorated service in the Marine Corps in Vietnam, Mueller graduated from University of Virginia Law School, according to his FBI biography

He worked for 12 years in the US attorney's offices, serving for some time as chief of the criminal division in the Northern District of California in San Francisco, and also working as an assistant US attorney in Boston.

He worked for a time in the private sector before moving back into government as an assistant to the attorney general in 1989, moving quickly to run the department's criminal division.

As chief of the criminal division, Mueller saw the creation of the agency's first cyber-dedicated unit, putting himself on the leading edge of a field of crime fighting and national security that has only grown more important.

Prior to joining the FBI in 2001, after he left Justice Department headquarters, Mueller served as the US attorney in San Francisco.

After leaving the FBI, Mueller joined private law firm WilmerHale, from which he is resigning to take the special counsel role.

6,Impeachment guide: It would be nasty and complicated,"Washington (CNN) "" We're in impeachment territory now ,"" declared David Gergen, the presidential counselor who should know a thing or two about the subject; he advised both a Republican (Richard Nixon) and Democrat (Bill Clinton), who dealt with impeachment in their respective second terms.

Gergen was talking on CNN Tuesday about the revelation that former FBI Director James Comey wrote contemporaneous memos after conversations in which he alleges President Donald Trump tried to get him to drop an investigation into Trump's then-national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties to Russia.

Impeachment, or as Alexander Hamilton called it in the Federalist #65, "" a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men,"" would be a nasty and partisan affair in the current climate.

Take a step back from the whack-a-mole and unending barrage of scandals and missteps that have beset Trump's young presidency, however, and the idea of impeachment, despite growing calls from Democrats ( CNN's KFile has counted 18 Democrats using the ""I"" word ), seems a long, long way off.

For starters, top Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, have not gone there yet. And that's telling. It would take a unified Democratic Party and a groundswell of defecting Republicans to impeach Trump. There's no evidence we're anywhere close to that.

Consider these points, which we've culled from information put out by the Senate and research papers by the Congressional Research Service as well as news reports from 1974 and 1999:

It's a complicated process

Considering how short the document is, the Constitution takes up quite a bit of space on the matter, spelling things out for the House, the Senate and the Executive in Articles I and II.

In Article I, Section 2:

The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

In Article II, Section 3:

The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

Judgment in Cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

In Article II, Section 4:

The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

In plain English, that means first, there needs to be evidence that Trump committed treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanors . Not just any crimes and misdemeanors, mind you. High ones. For Clinton, he was accused of perjury and obstruction of justice. For Nixon, list was longer and passed through a House committee as part of three articles. Regardless, it is an extremely broad and subjective target and there's been a lot of scholarship about exactly what it means. So even though this country has historically shown a willingness to give its chief executive a lot of latitude, let's assume this Comey thing (or something else) qualifies. What next?

How would it happen?

The full House would authorize one of its committees, usually the judiciary committee, to investigate and consider impeachment, according to an overview from the Congressional Research Service

That committee conducts an investigation and draws up articles of impeachment.

They then vote in that committee on whether to refer some or all of the articles to the full House.

The Clinton impeachment trial on the Senate floor in Washington D.C. on February 12, 1996. Prompted by the Lewinsky sex scandal, the United States Senate acquitted him on February 12, 1999.

If the committee votes to impeach, they prepare a report for the full House, which then debates and votes on the articles. The House can approve some of the articles and not others. In the case of Bill Clinton, for instance, two of four articles were approved by the full house

If the full House votes for impeachment on a simple majority, the approved articles are then referred to the Senate, which conducts a trial. Chief Justice John Roberts would preside, according to the Constitution. Members of the House lead the prosecution and senators are jurors.

Senators then meet in closed session and vote on whether to convict and remove from office. A conviction requires a two-thirds majority. That's 67 senators. Sixty-seven!

Republicans control the House and Senate

Both Nixon, who wasn't actually impeached, and Clinton, who was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, were facing off against a hostile Congress controlled by the opposing party. So was Andrew Johnson, the Democratic vice president who succeeded Abraham Lincoln as president after his assassination and was impeached by the hostile Republicans who controlled Capitol Hill. He was acquitted too. Got that? the Senate is 0-for-2 on convicting presidents from the other political party.

Republicans -- Trump is a Republican, remember -- have a 238-193 majority in the House. That means 20 or more Republicans, depending on who is voting, would have to break ranks to impeach their Republican President.

And that would be the easy part.

Republicans currently have 52 senators, so 19 of them would have to break ranks and vote to convict a Republican president, assuming all Democrats voted to do so.

Nixon, by the way, resigned before impeachment went to a vote in the full House of Representatives. In that case, most of the Republicans on the judiciary committee opposed the articles.

Republicans have not turned on Trump

There is not even a critical mass of Republicans who think there should be a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Exactly zero Republicans have said anything close to supportive of impeachment. Trump is likely to be protected by his Republican allies.

Impeachment is extremely rare

Just 19 people -- two presidents, one senator, one secretary of war and 15 judges -- have been impeached by the House and tried in the Senate. Of those, only eight were convicted. Seven, including both impeached presidents, were acquitted. Charges were dropped against three others after they were either expelled from office or resigned.

Most officials who get to the point of impeachment would rather resign a la Nixon than face a public trial in the Senate. The US also has regular elections. A representative or senator is more likely to be expelled from their respective body by their peers or kept from re-election by the voters.

It takes a long time

The impeachment process takes months and months. There are years of this administration in front of us, but the impeachment process would seem like an eternity in the Trump era if the current pace of news keeps up. The House first voted to consider impeaching Nixon in February 1974. The House judiciary committee didn't vote on an article of impeachment until July 24. Nixon resigned on August 8 of that year before the full House had voted.

Clinton was acquitted by the Senate, although a majority voted against him, on February 13, 1999",cnn
6,Trump reportedly urged Comey to jail reporters,"(CNN) Before President Donald Trump reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the investigation into deposed national security adviser Michael Flynn 's ties to Russia, he also reportedly made a remarkable suggestion about journalists.

""Alone in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump began the discussion by condemning leaks to the news media, saying that Mr. Comey should consider putting reporters in prison for publishing classified information, according to one of Mr. Comey's associates.""

Um, what?

Understandably, the bulk of the coverage in the wake of Schmidt's bombshell has focused on what it means for Trump if he did indeed ask Comey to stop an ongoing investigation. (White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday afternoon of the reported meeting: ""The President's been very clear. This is not an accurate representation of that meeting."")

But, the suggestion from a sitting President of the United States to the FBI Director that journalists be jailed for reporting on classified information is, in and of itself, a stunning statement that goes beyond even Trump's most virulent anti-media statements to date.

Throughout the 2016 campaign and even in the White House, Trump has been outspoken about his distaste for the media. He would regularly refer to the journalists covering the campaign as ""some of the most dishonest people"" he had ever met and insist that the press was deeply biased against him.

Even as recently as Wednesday, at a commencement speech at the Coast Guard Academy, Trump, ripped the media for its alleged bad treatment

""Look at the way I have been treated lately, especially by the media,"" Trump told the graduates. ""No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly. You can't let them get you down, you can't let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams.""

And, his administration hasn't been shy about its desire to crack down on the leaking of classified information.

Trump has repeatedly insisted that the leaks coming from the intelligence community are the real story regarding Flynn and the Russia investigation. In March, he tweeted : ""The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!"" And in February he said this ( via Twitter , again): ""The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ""intelligence"" like candy. Very un-American!""

It's worth noting here that no president was harder on leakers than the man who preceded Trump in the White House. Then-President Barack Obama set records for the number of leak prosecutions. Obama defended that record as the result of a number of holdover prosecutions from the George W. Bush White House.

""Many of the cases that are often lumped into, you know, my ledger, essentially were cases that were brought before we came into office,"" he said in an interview with the Rutgers University student newspaper last year . ""Some of them are serious, where you had purposeful leaks of information that could harm or threaten operations or individuals who were in the field involved with really sensitive national security issues.""

Still, what we are talking about here is not prosecuting leakers but rather the journalists who are on the receiving end of those leaks. And that is something entirely different -- and more dangerous.

""He's had a running war with the media but this, if this were actually to happen, would be a very dark new chapter,"" CNN media reporter Brian Stelter said on CNN's ""New Day Wednesday morning

It seems extremely unlikely that Trump or whomever he appoints as his next FBI director would put much emphasis on the jailing of journalists who report on classified information. And there is a widespread belief in the journalistic (and legal) community that such an effort would be doomed to failure. (Side bar: This Congressional Research Service report from February 2017 suggests it is a bit more of an open question.)

The point is not that this will happen anytime soon -- or, hopefully, ever. The point is that the president of the United States reportedly floated the idea of jailing journalists for reporting classified information in a one-on-one exchange with the then director of the FBI.

The Dow ended 373 points lower Wednesday -- about a 1.8% decline. It's the biggest drop since September.

A key measure of market volatility also spiked. The common ""I word"" in the market lexicon -- inflation -- is now being replaced by whispers of impeachment.

Gold prices have popped over the past week too. The yellow metal often does well when investors are nervous. It's a classic flight to safety bet. The US dollar has also sunk recently against the euro and other currencies. And virtual currency Bitcoin has soared.

Investors had been betting that Trump would cut back on regulations against Wall Street firms put into place by President Obama. Those hopes may now be fading.

CNNMoney's Fear and Greed Index, which looks at seven gauges of market sentiment, slipped to Neutral mode Wednesday. It had been showing signs of Greed previously.

The VIX (VIX), a measure of market volatility that is one of the components of the Fear & Greed Index, spiked nearly 40% Wednesday.

It's a fairly big selloff, but nowhere close to some of the bigger market drops that stocks experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

It also comes just two days after both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. Corporate earnings have been strong. Consumers remain confident as well.

The Dow is still up about 4% so far in 2017 while the S&P 500 is up 5%.

And the Nasdaq has soared 12% -- largely due to strong earnings from five tech giants in the index that just so happen to be the most valuable companies in America -- Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).

Still, there are some indications of investor unease about the situation in Washington. Banks were among the biggest losers Wednesday.

Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell 4%. Goldman Sachs (GS) was down 5%. And Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) each nosedived close to 6%.

Related: Dollar slumps as Trump's latest crisis spooks investors

The market seems to be betting that, at a bare minimum, Trump's economic plans -- tax reform, undoing Obama-era regulations on banks and healthcare and stimulus though a big boost to infrastructure spending -- are dead in the water for some time,

""Trump's agenda already had stalled; now there's the likelihood that issues like tax reform will get crowded out by this political crisis,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist with Horizon Investments, in a report.

Valliere thinks that talk of impeachment is still premature, but that ""this a political earthquake, and the aftershocks will persist for the rest of Trump's presidency.""

Focus on that last part of the quote. ""The rest of Trump's presidency.""

One reason that the markets may not be in full blown panic mode about the latest crisis du jour in Washington is because they may be already anticipating the possibility that Trump will not serve a full term in the White House.

And even if Trump were to quit, be impeached or be removed from office via the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, Vice President Mike Pence might be able to have a better chance of getting some of Trump's proposals through Congress.

""People are still looking ahead to the hopes of tax reform as opposed to whatever the new scandal of the moment on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is,"" said John Norris, managing director with Oakworth Capital Bank.

""And even if there is impeachment, some would argue that you have a smoother political operator with Pence,"" Norris added.

A former FBI boss, Robert Mueller, has been named special counsel to oversee an inquiry into Russia's alleged interference in the US election.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said it was in the public interest to bring in an outsider.

The appointment has been widely praised by politicians from both sides.

Calls for a special prosecutor had mounted since President Donald Trump fired the most recent FBI director, James Comey, last week.

Just over an hour after the news of Mr Mueller's appointment emerged, President Trump predicted the investigation would confirm there had been no collusion.

""A thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,"" he said.

And the House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said he had ""impeccable credentials"".

In his statement announcing the move, Mr Rosenstein said: ""The public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.""

The stakes just rose: analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

In announcing the appointment of a special counsel, Mr Rosenstein cited the ""unusual circumstances"" of the ongoing FBI Russia investigation. That's an understatement.

The circumstances are not just unusual, they are unprecedented. The nation has never had an administration so embattled so early in its term. There have never been such grave allegations of electoral meddling by a foreign power in a US presidential election.

Then again there has never been a president quite like Donald Trump.

Now the Russia story enters a new, more serious phase. Robert Mueller has a sterling reputation in Washington, DC. He worked with Mr Comey when the latter served as deputy attorney general in George W Bush's administration. He understands pressure-cooker politics and knows how to navigate the corridors of power.

He has wide latitude to conduct his investigation and bring criminal charges, if necessary.

While Mr Mueller is technically still part of the justice department and ultimately reports to Mr Trump, his stature is such that he is unlikely to be cowed by the president.

Independent investigations often take on a life of their own and can reach unexpected conclusions. With Mr Mueller in the game, the stakes just went up.

The White House has been engulfed in controversy following a string of controversies including Mr Comey's abrupt dismissal and allegations that Mr Trump asked the ousted FBI chief to drop an inquiry into links between his ex-national security adviser and Russia.

Mr Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced out in February after he misled the vice-president about his conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office.

Rhodri Morgan's time as first minister included two coalitions. In the first, with the Liberal Democrats between 2000 and 2003, Mike German served as deputy first minister.

Lord German called the former Welsh Labour leader a ""strong opponent but a great friend"".

""Wales has lost a great politician and stalwart tonight,"" he said.

Plaid Cymru's Ieuan Wyn Jones, who was deputy first minister to Mr Morgan under the One Wales coalition, said: ""He was very easy to work with, and he was very likeable, extremely loyal and highly knowledgeable.

""It wasn't easy for him to deliver the coalition in sections of his party, but Rhodri stood firm and we agreed a very progressive programme of government.""

Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, himself a former AM who sparred with Mr Morgan in the Senedd chamber, said he was ""a significant politician"" and ""great servant to Wales"".

Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the former first minister ""was much respected across the political spectrum and led Wales with distinction during a crucial period in Welsh history"".

Expressing her deepest sympathy on behalf of the members of the assembly and its staff, the institution's presiding officer Elin Jones said: ""As First Minister of Wales, Rhodri's contribution in helping build our nation and its young democracy was immeasurable.

""Rhodri's ability to communicate with, and to understand, the diverse communities of Wales ultimately won hearts and minds, and was critical in giving the people of Wales the confidence to strengthen and develop the National Assembly.""

'He spoke like no other politician'

By Tomos Livingstone, BBC Wales political correspondent

Rhodri Morgan stabilised Welsh devolution after its rocky first year, and spent nine years as first minister in his own idiosyncratic style.

At a time when sound bites were the norm, he spoke like no other politician - his response to being asked whether he wanted to lead the yet-to-be-created assembly was ""do one-legged ducks swim in a circle?""

In office he pursued a strategy of differentiating his administration from Tony Blair's New Labour government, using the new devolved powers to opt-out from Blairite reforms to health and education.

3,Macron cabinet: Women are half of France's new ministers,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Macron's new sports minister is Laura Flessel, an Olympic fencing champion

French President Emmanuel Macron has unveiled a gender-balanced cabinet in accordance with an earlier pledge, with 11 of 22 posts taken by women.

Sylvie Goulard is defence minister while Olympic fencing champion Laura Flessel is sports minister.

Bruno Le Maire is economy minister, Gérard Collomb is interior minister and François Bayrou is justice minister.

Mr Macron's decision to pluck figures from across the political spectrum has sent the French right into disarray.

Mr Le Maire is a conservative moderate, Mr Collomb is the Socialist mayor of Lyon and Mr Bayrou is a veteran centrist.

Some 170 elected officials from the right were earlier criticised by hundreds of other lawmakers after they signed a statement backing Mr Macron.

One accused Mr Macron of ""blowing up"" the political landscape.

France's new president will hope his team delivers a majority in parliamentary elections next month.

He delivered on his pledge of a cabinet of parity - though only one of the top five posts, that of defence, went to a woman.

Other ministerial appointees include Jean-Yves Le Drian, in charge of defence under President François Hollande, who will become foreign minister. Nicolas Hulot, a well-known environmentalist, becomes ecology minister.

Long-time Macron supporter and campaign manager Richard Ferrand is rewarded with the territorial cohesion portfolio.

Other ministerial appointees include:

Agnès Buzyn - health

Murielle Pénicaud - labour

Mounir Mahjoubi - junior minister for digital affairs

Françoise Nyssen - culture

Jean-Michel Blanquer - national education

Jacques Mézard - agriculture and food

Marlène Schiappa, whose successful blog Maman Works saw her dubbed the ""spokeswoman for working mums"", becomes junior minister for equality between women and men.

As well as the political centre ground, Mr Macron also took in figures from the left.

The announcement was delayed after candidates were background-checked for their tax records and any potential conflicts of interest.

'A slap'

It comes amid consternation among forces of both the left and right at Mr Macron's offer to join him in his political project of bridging the divide.

After he named Republican Edouard Philippe as prime minister on Monday, more than 170 elected conservatives agreed to sign up to the project, some claiming they were witnessing the ""transformation"" of politics.

However, the Republican party rejected Mr Macron's ""outstretched hand"" ahead of upcoming election.

It announced it was expelling Mr Phillipe, along with new economy minister Bruno Le Maire, and Gérald Darmanin, who took responsibility for public accounts.

In response, Mr Le Maire said he had ""chosen to serve"" and said he believed ""France is worth more than all the [political] parties"".

Image copyright AFP Image caption Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has been accused of opportunism by some on the right

Ahead of the June legislative elections, Republican campaign chief François Baroin accused Mr Macron of ""putting a bomb under politics rather than remodelling it"".

The initiative has also been criticised on the left, with defeated Socialist presidential candidate Benoît Hamon among the dissenters.

""Who can think that the left will pull itself together if it is part of a coalition led by a member of the Republican party?"" he said.

Separately, Mr Macron met the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to start talks on an ""ambitious European policy"".

The new president had promised to reform the EU while remaining an ardent supporter.

Mr Tusk told the French leader: ""Europe needs your energy, your imagination and your courage.""",bbc-news
10,Android O release date and beta features,"Android O is the next version of Google’s mega-popular mobile operating system set to release this Summer.

Until then, you can join the open beta at this link. Keep in mind that you'll need to have a Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X or Pixel C to get started

This big Android update for 2017 will continue its beta following the Google IO 2017 presentation and will likely debut in full first on the Google Pixel 2.

Don't have a Google-branded phone? The company announced Project Treble, an initiative that will ensure that Android O comes to many more devices than previous operating system updates.

We’ve already seen a healthy list of new features out of the beta, both visual and performance-based, that are worth getting excited about even if the new version doesn’t make groundbreaking changes like Material Design did in Android Lollipop.

Stay tuned in the months ahead as we uncover many more new features in future beta developments. But for now, follow along as we dive into a list of confirmed features, some of which are available right now in the beta.

If you want to try Android O out for yourself, feel free to follow the instructions in the link below, but be warned that the beta in intended primarily for developers and curious thrill-chasers and as such, shouldn't be used on your daily driver.

Here’s how to install Android O right now

Confirmed Android O features

Picture in Picture (PiP) mode

As is already seen on the iPad and some bespoke third-party launchers for Android, this would natively allow you to have one supported app remain lay on top of another separate app.



This is a minor feature, but one that makes multitasking less of a compromise than split-window mode and more of a relaxed experience. Unfortunately, while settings for PiP do appear in the first developer preview, the feature doesn’t seem to be working as intended just yet.

Faster boot times

While speedy boot times are usually associated with a step-up in hardware. But Google unveiled that Android O will bring those benefits to all phones that run the software.



And it's not just the operating system that becomes faster to load up, but the apps on your phone can start running faster, too.

Restricted background activities

This is a power-saving feature that de-prioritizes app functions running in the background, which in turn means that your battery is going to possibly last much longer than it currently does on Android Nougat.



Paired with likely improvements to the Doze function that intelligently saves battery during down-time, it’s feasible that Android O could help squeeze an extra handful of hours out of your phone.

Notifications

Each new version of Android seems to bring along an update to notifications and O is no exception. Nougat allowed you to take action right within the notification panel and as we’ve seen in the first developer preview, now developers can grant even greater power to users to toggle settings that usually require digging through menu after menu.



Although confirmed, we’ve yet to see this feature in full bloom. The first developer preview shows that the settings have been reconfigured, but these changes seem to be laying the framework for the new tweaks to come down the line.



We’ll likely see Google talk more about this one soon, as it could really make life easier for those who get buried in notifications.

Contextual press-to-hold options

In an e-mail trying to copy an address so that you can paste it into Google Maps? No more, says Android O. By using machine learning, the OS can now recognize which app is best for the string of characters you're working with. Another example included being able to highlight a phone number and pop right into the dialer.

Adaptive app icons

As the name suggests, Google has introduced strict design guidelines for developers to adhere to that will help to create a unified visual style across more apps.



In addition, these new app icons will animate based on user interaction and...have you seen the animation demo? Look up. It looks awesome, no?

Boosted audio performance

The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the first Android phone to come installed with Bluetooth 5, a technology that will widen the bandwidth and raise the speed limit in the wireless pipeline for your content to travel through and thus, enhance the quality of audio content sent wirelessly between your phone and headphones.



And while many devices will follow suit, audio quality on Android is going to get yet another boost thanks to Android O’s native support for LDAC, Sony’s hi-res Bluetooth audio codec.



In the developer options, we’re already seeing tons of options for tweaking the bitrate for audio and we expect more advancements to come down the line. This one could be a big deal, especially for those holding out on buying into the best wireless headphones.

Notification dots

An oldie that's been knocking around for years on iOS and some third-party launchers, this brings an at-a-glance notification bubble to app icons on the homescreen as a native Android feature.

In the notification settings, we noticed that there is a spot that asks if users want to display a badge.

If you have any questions about Android O as the beta presses on, feel free to send me a message on Twitter and I’d be more than happy help out.",techradar
6,Justice Department taps former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel for Russia investigation,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share There is going to be a special prosecutor for the Russia investigation. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) tells us who it is. Buzz60

The Justice Department tapped former FBI director Robert Mueller to be a special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, the department announced Wednesday.

The news comes as President Trump and his administration grapple with the fallout from explosive revelations earlier this week that now-fired FBI director James Comey kept notes of a February meeting indicating Trump asked him to close the agency's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The memo, on the heels of Trump's abrupt firing of Comey last week, fueled accusations by lawmakers of possible obstruction of justice – and calls for an independent prosecutor to oversee the FBI's ongoing counterintelligence probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the presidential campaign.

""I determined that it is on the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Wednesday. ""My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted.""

Based on the ""unique circumstances,"" Rosenstein said, ""the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.""

After the Justice Department's announcement, Trump on Wednesday night denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia and called for a quick end to the investigation.

""As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know – there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,"" Trump said in a short statement. ""I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.""

The new special counsel, Mueller, served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013 under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.

Mueller, who preceded Comey as FBI director, was the longest serving director since J. Edgar Hoover. He served two additional years beyond his 10-year term, to ensure stability during a transition period in President Obama's national security team.

In his special counsel role, Mueller assumes all the powers of a federal prosecutor – including subpoena authority.

""I have determined that a special counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome,"" Rosenstein said. ""Our nation is grounded on the rule of law and the public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly. Special Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation, and I am confident that he will follow the facts, apply the law and reach a just result.""

The authority to appoint a special counsel fell to Rosenstein, after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia case because of his pre-election contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which Sessions did not disclose during his Senate confirmation hearing.

Mueller, who joined law firm WilmerHale in 2014, will resign to avoid any conflicts of interest with firm clients or attorneys, the Justice Department said.

At the White House, administration officials Wednesday evening could be seen racing in and out of West Wing offices, formulating a response to the new development.

White House officials such press secretary Sean Spicer had said as recently as Tuesday there was no need for a special counsel.

Yet key Republicans lawmakers immediately welcomed the announcement. ""Mueller is a great selection. Impeccable credentials. Should be widely accepted,"" tweeted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chair of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform committee.

Mueller is a great selection. Impeccable credentials. Should be widely accepted. — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) May 17, 2017

Democratic senators also welcomed the news. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was Hillary Clinton's running mate in last November's presidential election, called the announcement ""a good move.""

""Now let's get some answers,"" he tweeted.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the appointment ""a good first step.""

""Bob was a fine U.S. attorney, a great FBI director and there’s no better person who could be asked to perform this function,"" she said in a statement. ""He is respected, he is talented and he has the knowledge and ability to do the right thing.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are conducting their own investigations into Russia's interference in the presidential election. The intelligence community has accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks against Democratic political organizations during the elections, and leaking them to websites such as WikiLeaks with the goal of undermining Hillary Clinton's campaign and public confidence in the democratic process.

Mueller's appointment, the Justice Department said Wednesday, was made through the special counsel statute. It was exercised only once before, in 1999, when then-Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Former Missouri Sen. Jack Danforth investigation into FBI handling of government raid on Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas.

Under provisions of the special counsel statute, Rosenstein still maintains some oversight authority in the investigation. But any decision to overrule the appointed counsel requires notification to the chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.

Rosenstein is scheduled to brief senators on Thursday about the decision to fire former FBI director James Comey. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he was now looking forward to hearing about Rosenstein's decision to appoint a special counsel.

Not all lawmakers say they necessarily saw a need for a special counsel. ""I think probably the hysteria was building up and they figured they'd calm it down send some raw meat to the wolf pack,"" Rep. Peter King, R- N.Y., former Homeland Security Committee chairman, told reporters about the reasoning for selecting one. ""If there's gonna be one there's gonna be one, doesn't matter to me but I don't see a need for it.""

And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had opposed the appointment of a special counsel, sent a statement that did not express approval or disapproval of the Justice Department's actions. ""The decision by the Deputy Attorney General to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel confirms that the investigation into Russian intervention into our election will continue, as stated last week by Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe,"" he said. ""The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will also continue its investigation into this matter.""

On the other hand, some Democrats indicated Mueller's appointment might not be enough. ""I respected him as FBI director. I think he did a great job,"" said Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. ""I think people are beginning to understand that this is bigger than Trump – this is about the country.""

Still, Clyburn said he hoped Congress would appoint a separate panel to take on the Russia inquiry. ""To me this does not negate a 9/11-type commission,"" Clyburn said.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said Democrats would go forward with a bill to create an independent commission. ""I think there’s a usefulness for both,"" he said. ""The independent commission is useful for purposes of investigation, a special prosecutor obviously considers whether any crimes were committed. So although their work will, obviously, overlap, they also perform different functions.""

The House earlier Wednesday rejected an attempt by Democrats to force a vote on creating an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The legislation would create a 12-member, bipartisan commission that could interview witnesses, obtain documents, issue subpoenas and receive public testimony to investigate Russia’s attempts to influence the election.

""Director Mueller will still be in the chain of command under the Trump-appointed leadership of the Justice Department,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""He cannot take the place of a truly independent, outside commission that is completely free from the Trump administration’s meddling.""

Pelosi continued, ""The question also remains: will Mueller’s investigation include President Trump’s attempt to intervene in the investigation of Michael Flynn? The American people have a right to the truth, free from the Trump Justice Department’s efforts to silence it.""

As he begins overseeing the wide-ranging Russia inquiry, Mueller ultimately will have to determine whether his successor, the recently dismissed Comey, could be needed as a witness.

Aside from their roles as former FBI directors, Mueller also shares another special connection with Comey.

In 2004, Comey, then deputy attorney general, and FBI director Mueller rushed to the hospital room of ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft to head off White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card who sought Ashcroft’s approval for the renewal of the controversial warrantless wiretap program. When Mueller and Comey threatened to resign, the White House relented.

Mueller's associates such as former FBI Deputy Director John Pistole, who served as his top assistant, praised the choice. “Bob Mueller is an outstanding choice because he is apolitical and follows the rule of law, and follows the evidence wherever it leads, regardless of political outcomes,’’ Pistole said.

Meanwhile, members on Capitol Hill pledged to continue their own investigations into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia.

Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Tx., who is heading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into the matter, said he was not given a heads up before the appointment, but he still expected his investigation to move forward as planned.

""I don't think it will have an effect,"" Conaway told reporters. ""The importance of our investigation, I don't think is diminished in the least.""

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said his panel's investigation would continue but he was happy there was an outside investigator in addition.

""Clearly, all these investigations will overlap, but the one that Mr. Mueller will be overseeing, I think, will probably have the most significance in a lot of ways,” Cummings said, citing “full-weight of the federal government and the justice department.” Mueller’s investigation, he added, would have more resources than the congressional committees.

6,Vulnerable Republicans lying low amid furor over claims about Trump and FBI,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share House Speaker Paul Ryan argues against rush to judgment on President Donald Trump revelations, adding ""we need the facts."" (May 17) AP

WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers in the eye of a gathering storm over President Trump’s Russia ties are surveying the potential for political damage and, at least for now, making no new attempts to distance themselves from the president.

Vulnerable Republicans like Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Darrell Issa of California are among a handful of House Republicans who’ve said they support the appointment of a special commission or prosecutor to investigate Russian interference in the U.S. election and potential collusion with the Trump campaign. Others include Walter Jones of North Carolina, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota and Justin Amash of Michigan.

Even so, Jones was the only Republican to support a procedural vote on Wednesday to actually help clear the way for an independent commission to investigate the Russia issue. Democrats forced the vote following a New York Times story that Trump had pressured former FBI director James Comey to pull back his Russia investigation. Republicans have already voted six times to block consideration of an outside probe, leading House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California to accuse them of “stonewalling.”

Other Republicans in swing districts are avoiding the issue altogether, as their Democratic challengers fire off statements demanding they speak up.

“Allegations that President Trump attempted to force Director Comey to end his investigation into [former national security adviser] General Flynn are gravely serious and indicate yet another attack on our democracy,” said Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat running for the seat currently held by Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. “His silence is unacceptable,” she said.

The offices of Frelinghuysen and Comstock did not respond to a request for comment.

Does Trump help or hurt?

Comstock and dozens of other potentially vulnerable Republicans are trying to forecast the lesser of two potentially damaging alternatives, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan newsletter at the University of Virginia.

“They’re in a really tough spot because, on the one hand, there’s this bad stuff coming out on Trump that makes his numbers worse and hurts Republicans; but on the other hand, if they do act against him they may be hurt too” due to anger among his supporters, said Kondik. They are the same members already under fire in their home districts over an unpopular GOP health care plan.

Even some Democratic leaders say they understand the political calculus their colleagues are making.

“The heart of the issue is 80% of Republicans still support Trump. I’m assuming my colleagues in the House and Senate read the same numbers and realize that parting with him or challenging him is risky politically at this point. The Republican base is still loyal,” Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, told USA TODAY. That’s even as polls show independents are moving away from Trump.

Democrats say an independent commission, similar to the one appointed to study the Sept. 11 terror attacks, is needed as opposed to leaving the work to existing congressional committees with insufficient staff and resources. Republicans led by House Speaker Paul Ryan say they want to get to the bottom of the “facts” in the case, while insisting the current committee structure is appropriate and accusing Democrats of injecting politics into the debate.

The politics of a commission — and its potential ramifications for the GOP — are clear. Additional revelations about Trump’s ties to Russia or his efforts to obstruct an FBI investigation into them would further drag down Trump’s already historically low approval ratings at this point in his presidency. According to the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, just 39% of Americans approve of his performance. Fifty-four percent disapprove.

That, in turn, could compromise all Republicans seeking reelection in 2018. The tension in the Capitol is palpable. One of the most vulnerable Republicans, Issa, reportedly gave the middle finger on Tuesday night to a Politico reporter, which he later denied.

Republican leaders on Wednesday carried on with normal business, holding a news conference on their priorities on tax reform. “Now is the time to gather all the pertinent information,” said Ryan. “We can’t deal with speculation and innuendo and there’s clearly a lot of politics being played.”

Supporting ongoing investigations

That left many vulnerable Republicans following Ryan’s lead in simply demanding more information through existing investigations. “Director Comey should testify publicly before Congress as soon as possible,” tweeted Rep. Leonard Lance, who represents a swing district in New Jersey.

Director Comey should testify publicly before Congress as soon as possible. — L.L. https://t.co/C4jrYnYeei — Rep. Leonard Lance (@RepLanceNJ7) May 16, 2017

Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey took to Facebook with a similar message.

“They need Trump to improve,” said Kondik.

The real risk could come further down the road.

The same outside Democratic groups that mobilized around health care, resulting in a 17% approval rating for a Republican plan to replace Obamacare, are now organizing on the Russia issue. For instance, on Wednesday a coalition of more than 90 groups including veterans, faith and social justice organizations sent a letter to House and Senate leaders demanding an independent, bipartisan commission.

“It is absolutely crucial, for the integrity of the Republic and the very Constitution that every elected official swore to uphold, that we begin truly independent investigations into Russia’s influence on the election, and possible collusion with the Trump team,” said Will Fischer, Iraq War Veteran and Director of Government Relations for VoteVets.

Further, Democrats appear prepared to withhold cooperating on major legislation until Republicans agree to an independent investigation, with many reciting the phrase: “Love of country ahead of party.” And if that agenda stalls, which is now highly likely, even Republicans acknowledge the consequences.

“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” said Ryan. “And that’s what we’ll be judged on in 2018. Did we make people’s lives better. Did we solve problems, did we fix problems people are confronting in their daily lives?”

Meantime Democrats insist that, behind the scenes, Republicans are prepared to make a break with the president, particularly if Comey presents his memos to Congress.

“The Republicans have to make a political calculation along the way, when is it safe enough to say what they have been saying privately, in a public way?"" Durbin said. ""They’re watching it carefully. There will come a moment when they make stark assessments about retaining their majority and how risky it is sticking with Trump.”

“They have to make a calculation and I’ve been here long enough in the House and Senate to know, it gets to be a pretty cold-blooded calculation if they see the bottom falling out,” Durbin said.

“There is a tipping point,” he said.

6,Donald Trump's leak of classified information involved bombs and new batteries,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Donald Trump's move to share highly classified information with Russia didn't necessarily break the law, but one analyst says that doesn't make it any less problematic for America's intelligence agencies, and their overseas partners. (May 16) AP

WASHINGTON — The intelligence finding that President Trump divulged to Russian officials during a meeting last week at the White House involved an advance in bomb making developed by the Islamic State that could be used against commercial aircraft, according to a U.S. official.

Operatives from the Islamic State, or ISIS, have determined how to implant and mask an explosive inside the battery of a laptop computer, increasing the likelihood that a bomb can be slipped past screeners onto an airplane.

The battery with the explosive charge still functions enough to allow airport security officials to power up the laptop, a standard test to determine if the machine is safe, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because officials are not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence matters.

The release of classified information was described in a memo to government agencies after the meeting between Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and was first reported by the Washington Post. Such notices are standard operating procedure after classified material has been divulged, an event that is referred to as ""spillage,"" the official said.

Trump's disclosure of the city where the unfolding plot was being hatched was considered ""code-word"" information, a super-secret classification.

The official — and the White House — played down the value of the information Trump released. It was known to many in the government, and given ISIS’ shrinking footprint, there are only a few cities that it could have come from, the official said. The New York Times reported that Israel was the foreign partner that passed along the intelligence.

Defending disclosure

Trump and his Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, have defended the disclosure of information to the Russians. Trump, in a tweet, pronounced ""an absolute right"" to informing the Russians of the threat. McMaster, meanwhile, told reporters that it ""wholly appropriate,"" and added that Trump wasn't aware of its source.

But a senior congressional staffer confirmed that the information divulged by Trump involved laptop computers and batteries. This official said the disclosure did harm U.S. intelligence collection efforts and that Trump may have tipped the Russians off to other sensitive sources and methods for collecting information. The staff member spoke on condition of anonymity, because staff were not authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters.

In Brussels on Wednesday, U.S. Homeland Security officials and their European counterparts exchanged security information as U.S. officials pressed their plan to ban laptops and tablets from the cabins of trans-Atlantic flights.

The American plan would expand a ban established in March for in-flight laptops and other large electronics for U.S.-bound flights from 10 airports in eight countries in the Middle East and Africa. The expansion involves routes carrying up to 65 million people annually on more than 400 daily flights, according to Homeland Security. The concern, officials stated at the time, was that explosives could be smuggled aboard in those consumer electronic devices.

​The International Air Transport Association, which represents more than 250 airlines in more than 100 countries, estimated the ban would cost more than $1 billion annually in lost time to passengers.

Agencies with a need to know about disclosures such as the one made by Trump made to the Russians are notified of spillage because it can affect their operations. In this case, Homeland Security needed to be notified of the issue as it oversees threats against U.S. interests.

16,Jennifer Lawrence: Not sorry for pole dancing caught on video,"Jennifer Lawrence promoting 'Passengers' in London On Dec. 1, 2016. (Photo: Vianney Le Caer, Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)

Jennifer Lawrence thumbed her nose at the tabloid media and the internet — again — on Wednesday after a blurry video surfaced of the global movie star drunkenly pole-dancing in a bar in Vienna, Austria.

Radar, the online website of the supermarket tab National Enquirer, published what it called the ""bombshell world exclusive"" video early Wednesday, showing a dark nightclub and a woman crawling around on all fours, dancing at a stripper pole, taking off her top and generally carrying on with male onlookers.

It wasn't immediately clear from the video that the woman was Lawrence. But Radar seemed shocked — shocked! — that ""America's sweetheart,"" as it termed the Oscar-winning Lawrence, could be caught wearing only a bra for ""scandalous dancing,” cutting loose ""like a low-rent gogo dancer in a Euro-trash strip club.""

But Lawrence, 26, was not scandalized about her antics on April 27 at the Beverly Hills Club in Vienna, where she has been working on a movie, Red Sparrow, a Cold War thriller in which she plays a ballerina-turned-spy.

Instead, Lawrence was defiant, and witty, a few hours later on her Facebook, thus confirming that the video did indeed depict her.

""Look: Nobody wants to be reminded that they tried to dance on a stripper pole by the internet. It was one of my best friend's birthdays and I dropped my paranoia guard for one second to have fun. I'm not going to apologize, I had a BLAST that night.""

And, P.S., ""that's not a bra it's an Alexander Wang top and I'm not gonna lie, I think my dancing's pretty good. Even with no core strength."" She signed it: ""Jen.""

Few Hollywood stars know better than Lawrence the dark side of the internet: She was the victim of a 2014 online hack in which nude pictures of her (and dozens of other celebrities) were stolen and posted online. She called the theft a ""sex crime.""

So far, at least two men have been convicted and sentenced in connection with the case. But Lawrence rarely posts on social media as a result.

Her cheeky attitude collected some kudos on Twitter.

TEL AVIV, Israel — With President Trump arriving in Israel next week as part of his first overseas trip, Israeli government officials maintained a disciplined silence Wednesday about his disclosure to Russian diplomats of highly classified intelligence obtained by Israel.

Israel has not denied reports that it was the source of the information about an Islamic State plot that Trump shared with Russia. Instead, officials said the leak wouldn't change the long-standing ties between the United States and Israel.

“The security relationship between Israel and our great ally the United States is deep, meaningful and unprecedented in its scope and contribution to our strength,” Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman tweeted. “That is how it has been and that is how it will continue to be.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who viewed President Barack Obama as a poor ally and greeted Trump’s election with barely disguised joy, was left politically exposed by the recent developments.

“Official Israel will not change its tone, but you might see the right-wing turn the pressure up on (Netanyahu),” said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “I don’t think the government wants to have any problems on a first visit, so they are trying to whitewash in public something Trump may well pay a price for further on, beyond what is publicly visible.""

Sallai Meridor, who was Israeli ambassador to the U.S. from 2005 to 2009, said the substance of Israeli-American ties would override whatever damage has been caused by the breach.

“I think Trump can expect a very warm reception here, regardless of the stories,"" Meridor said. ""I think Israelis' basic warm feelings toward America and the Israeli perception that Trump and his administration hold fundamentally pro-Israel positions will guide the visit.""

“It is neither the first nor the last time a head of state blurts out something that shouldn’t be said. But this time may be a bit worse than the others,” Sima Shine, former head of research at Mossad, Israel's vaunted intelligence agency, told USA TODAY.

Shine, currently a senior researcher at Tel Aviv’s Institute of National Security Studies, noted two important aspects of the incident. First, “the degree of detail revealed."" And second, ""that it went to the Russians. They make as if they’re fighting against ISIS, but they are allied to Iran and Hezbollah, who are not our friends, and to the Syrian government. That makes this a worse breach than others of this type.”

Still, “it is not the end of the world,"" she said. ""Relations between the United States and Israel at all levels, including intelligence, are so important to each side, including in the fight against ISIS, ... that I see no real chance future bilateral collaboration will be damaged.”

9,NFL looking into Tom Brady concussion claim by Gisele Bundchen,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In an interview on 'CBS This Morning,' Gisele Bundchen told Charlie Rose that Tom Brady has suffered concussions.

The NFL says it is working with the players union to gather more information from the New England Patriots medical staff and star quarterback Tom Brady, whose supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen, said in a TV interview Brady suffered a concussion last season.

The Patriots never listed Brady on the injury report with a concussion or head injury last season.

“We have reviewed all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants and certified athletic trainer spotters who worked at Patriots' home and away 2016 season games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league office,” the NFL said in a statement.

“There are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms. Today we have been in contact with the NFLPA and will work together to gather more information from the club's medical staff and Mr. Brady. The health and safety of our players is our foremost priority and we want to ensure that all our players have and continue to receive the best care possible.”

MORE COVERAGE:

An NFL Players Association spokesman deferred to a statement earlier Wednesday by executive director DeMaurice Smith, who told CSN Mid-Atlantic the union would “proceed with our process as we normally would for any player” and pointed out steps the NFLPA has taken in recent years to be proactive on player health and safety, especially concussions.

The NFL and NFLPA have a process under the collective-bargaining agreement to investigate possible deviations from concussion protocol. So, this amounts to a routine follow-up – albeit one involving a high-profile player who happened to be the central figure in the controversial Deflategate case.

Bundchen first brought up the claim in an interview with CBS This Morning when asked about her desire for Brady to retire soon.

“I just have to say, as a wife, as you know (the NFL) is not the most, let’s say, unaggressive sport. Football, he had a concussion last year,” she said. “He has concussions pretty much every…I mean we don’t talk about it. But he has concussions and I don’t really think it’s a healthy thing for your body to go through. You know, that kind of aggression all the time, that cannot be healthy for you. I’m planning on having him be healthy and do a lot of fun things when we’re like 100 I hope.”

WASHINGTON — Add Joe Lieberman to the list of potential FBI directors.

The former Connecticut senator and 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee is among four finalists being interviewed by President Trump on Wednesday, a week after his dismissal of previous FBI director James Comey ignited a political firestorm.

The others, according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer: acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma governor and Justice Department spokesman Frank Keating, and former senior FBI official Richard McFeely.

Trump said he hopes to announce a new FBI director by the time he leaves on a foreign trip Friday.

The interviews come a day after news reports about Comey's claim that Trump asked him to drop an FBI investigation into the conduct of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Lieberman nearly became the nation's first Jewish vice president, as he and Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore lost the contested 2000 election to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. A former attorney general in Connecticut, Lieberman won election to the U.S. Senate in 1988 and retired after four terms.

He showed a large independent streak during his Senate years and actually won his last term as an independent after losing the Democratic Party nomination over his support for the Iraq war. Lieberman often backed George W. Bush administration policies in the war on terrorism, and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain considered Lieberman as a running mate.

Late last year, Lieberman public defended David Friedman, Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, over comments that Friedman had made about some Jewish-American leaders.

Lieberman is now senior counsel with Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman — a firm that has represented businessman Donald Trump in defamation suits and other legal battles.

16,"'The Dark Knight's' Joker did not kill Heath Ledger, says sister","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The trailer for the upcoming Spike documentary on the life of actor Heath Ledger has been released. USA TODAY

'I Am Heath Ledger' arrives on Spike TV May 17. (Photo: Karin Catt)

An untimely death, especially a famous one, can color the truth.

I Am Heath Ledger, a new documentary about the actor supported by his family, dispels one common rumor: The Joker did not bring the Australian actor down.

“Honestly, that’s been the biggest thing for us as a family,” says Kate Ledger, Heath’s elder sister, by phone. “He had an amazing sense of humor and certainly playing the Joker, for him it was one big gag. He had so much fun doing that. It was actually the exact opposite. There was no doom and gloom. ... That was a shock to me that people even thought that, really.”

The documentary hits theaters tonight (Wednesday) for one night only in partnership with Fathom Events, and then will air on Spike TV on May 17.

Ledger died on Jan. 22, 2008, at age 28 in New York City from an accidental overdose of prescription medication and sleeping aids. The role of the Joker would win him a posthumous Oscar for his work in The Dark Knight in 2009.

“Like many of us, we read all sorts of insinuations online that Heath Ledger was taken down this dark spiral path to the depths of depression from his role as the Joker — this is the reason why we lost this bright star so early in his life,” says I Am Heath Ledger producer and co-director Derik Murray. “What was incredible, what was really quite amazing is that the truth behind that is so polar opposite.”

I Am Heath Ledger begins during Ledger’s youth, utilizing hours of the actor’s own home videos. The film charts his quick rise in Hollywood. Less than a year after moving to Los Angeles, he booked the lead role in the 1999 hit teen rom-com 10 Things I Hate About You opposite Julia Stiles.

Then Ledger pivoted, turning down opportunities like Spider-Man and making films that would lead him to work like Lords of Dogtown and his Oscar-nominated role in Brokeback Mountain.

“As you see in the documentary, he could have very easily gone down that heartthrob career (path) and done a lot of those roles, and he chose not to right from the very beginning,"" says Kate. ""He wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. He was always in command of what he did. He wouldn’t just do something for the money.”

Kate Ledger says filmmakers have been knocking at her family’s door since her brother’s death, but it was the involvement of executive producer Matt Amato, her brother’s close friend, that gave them trust the documentary would be done right.

Plus, they had Michelle Williams’ blessing. “We wouldn’t have done anything otherwise,” says Kate, revealing little about Ledger’s ex-girlfriend or their child together, Matilda (now 11), though she confirms the family sees both often. “I love them so much and I’m so protective of them that I don’t like to discuss them. Because it’s very private, their life, and I just like to keep it like that,” she says.

Though Ledger’s parents, directors and friends (including Naomi Watts and Ben Harper) appear in the documentary, Williams does not. “She just felt she was not ready to be on camera and be talking about Heath, which we respected,” says Murray.

Today, Kate Ledger says dealing with her brother’s death as the world watched nine years ago was indescribable.

“It’s almost like two separate things. The shock itself was one thing and dealing with it in the public eyes was completely different — I actually can’t put it into words and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to,” says Ledger, who has since set up a scholarship in her brother’s name for emerging Australian talent. “Not too many people have to experience that. It’s hard enough to experience losing a loved one (without) doing it in front of everyone else. It’s horrendous.”

9,The NFL's 10-minute overtime won't be the disaster some fear | FOX Sports,"Indianapolis Colts v San Diego Chargers

Next week at the NFL spring meetings, owners are expected to approve the biggest change to overtime in NFL history -- shortening the extra session from a full 15 minutes to 10. Ostensibly the reasoning is player safety, as if playing 70 minutes instead of 75 is going to provide a major benefit for the players involved in the four or five NFL games per season that ever get past 10 minutes in OT. (If player safety is the aim, get rid of two preseason games: 120 minutes > 5 minutes.)

Though reaction has largely been negative to the expected rule change, I'm less skeptical. It sounds like a worthy plan.

Still, the truth is, until the change is implemented and the first OTs are played, nobody has any idea how it's going to go. We think we know, but conventional wisdom doesn't always hold to form when NFL coaches are involved. Moving the extra-point back didn't lead to a surge of two-point conversion attempts. The kickoff and touchback changes were supposed to encourage fewer returns. Instead, the opposite happened. Remember when the NFL changed the rule that said defenders couldn't push receivers out of bounds while they were in midair? People thought it'd lead to a new era of secondary play (sit back, wait and then bum-rush the WR in midair to force him out). It didn't. Quarterbacks are still getting hurt despite the NFL doing everything but putting a red jersey on them. Teams adapt differently than rules committees believe.

Overall, though, I'm on board with this move, though not without some healthy concerns.",fox-sports
9,Michael Bisping reveals knee injury will delay return but still wants GSP next | FOX Sports,"UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping is holding out hope that he’ll still face Georges St-Pierre in his next fight, but even if that matchup is taken away from him it appears he won’t be returning to the Octagon any time soon.

Bisping responded to UFC president Dana White’s recent comments where he said he was cancelling the matchup with St-Pierre after the former welterweight champion revealed that he wouldn’t be ready to fight until after November.

In St-Pierre’s place, White stated that No. 1 ranked middleweight contender Yoel Romero would get the next shot at Bisping with the date happening much earlier in the year.

Now according to Bisping, the delay to the fight with St-Pierre worked out better for him anyways because he’s dealing with a lingering knee injury that would prevent him from competing in the near future regardless of the opponent.

“I will say this and I’ve said it before, it’s a blessing in disguise cause I can’t fight any time soon,” Bisping said on his “Believe You Me” podcast. “I can’t exercise at all at the moment. I can’t train. My knee is giving me many, many problems. It was doing it in Thailand, it’s still getting no better. I haven’t trained since I’ve been in London cause I’ve been busy most days. I’ve flirted with some weights in the hotel gym, which is not very good shall we say. I haven’t trained and it just isn’t getting better. The back of my knee is incredibly tight. I can’t actually straighten my left leg. I think that’s because all the tendons and ligaments and muscles are super tight and that’s why I can’t straighten it. My surgeon said we had to work on stretching that but it just kind of got extenuated if you will and it’s super tight. I can’t even walk for like five minutes so I need to get back and start getting some treatment on that.

“So long story short what I’m getting at is that I’m not going to be ready to fight any time soon anyways. So that’s another reason why this played out into the perfect scenario for me.”

WARNING EXPLICIT LANGUAGE:

Bisping says while White has made it clear that he’s moving past the proposed matchup with St-Pierre, he still hasn’t spoken to the UFC president or anyone from the promotion to tell him that the fight is officially off.

Regardless of what’s been said, Bisping believes that should still be his next fight because that’s the bout he agreed to take and he still wants to face St-Pierre next.

“Honestly, it’s news to me. I haven’t heard anything about it. I reached out to Georges and he said he hasn’t heard anything official either and I still haven’t heard anything from the UFC or Dana White. I know that a lot of people are complaining about this potential delay with Georges so we’ll see what happens,” Bisping said.

“To clarify, no official word from the UFC. I haven’t heard anything. Georges is still hoping for it. I’m still hoping for it. I’ll say this, I was offered the fight twice. I was offered the fight in October and it never materialized. I was offered the fight in January or February and it did materialize and we had a press conference and we shook hands and we stood there in Las Vegas and we talked a bit of [expletive]. So OK, I haven’t had a bout agreement, but that is the plan. That was the offer and I accepted. I kind of feel once a deal is made we should stick to it, that’s how I feel.”

Without speaking to the UFC, Bisping can’t say exactly why the organization suddenly decided to scrap the matchup with St-Pierre other than needing title fights to headline upcoming pay-per-views this summer.

As much as Bisping sympathizes with their woes, he’s still not going to be ready to fight any time soon so it doesn’t sound like the middleweight title would be up for grabs regardless of whether or not the bout with St-Pierre happens.

“Maybe they need an active champion to fight sooner. I think that’s probably at the top of it,” Bisping said. “I honestly don’t think they’re trying to push pressure on Georges. They need title fights on the pay-per-views, which I understand. I understand the frustration from their side, just like a lot of the middleweight division are kind of frustrated. They need title fights on their pay-per-views and waiting until November is a significant delay so I understand that.

“But as I said, we did have a deal. I have to speak to the UFC and see what’s happening.”

Of course, several middleweight contenders will surely be frustrated to hear about this newest delay in getting the next title fight scheduled.

At the top of the list is Romero, who was declared the No. 1 contender last November when he knocked out former champion Chris Weidman and yet he’s still sitting on the sidelines waiting for Bisping to return.

From the sound of things as bad as Bisping might feel for anyone waiting for a shot at his belt, they will just have to stay patient until he’s ready to fight again.

“Yoel’s been there for a bit now, I understand that,” Bisping said. “Robert Whittaker is there and Gegard [Mousasi] as well but I’ve got a fight booked and until I hear any differently from an official source, I’m expecting to fight GSP.”",fox-sports
9,"25 years ago today, the Cleveland Cavaliers ended Larry Bird's NBA career","As the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers prepare to open the Eastern Conference finals Wednesday night, it’s worth noting that the teams met 25 years ago to the day … and the Cavs slammed the door shut on Larry Bird’s career.

Bird was 35 and beset by back problems that limited him to 45 games — the second-fewest of his career — but still an All-Star for the 12th time in his 13 seasons. Bird averaged 20.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 6.8 assists for a 51-31 Celtics squad that was reloading six seasons after its last championship, still riding its aging big three of Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parrish but infusing new blood with Reggie Lewis, Dee Brown and Rick Fox.

The Cavs were in the middle of their most successful run of the pre-LeBron era: 10 winning seasons in 11 years, and that 1991-92 squad won 66 games including the playoffs, which was a franchise record at the time. The Celtics met them in the second round and despite playing the first three games without Bird — who’d missed an opening-round sweep of Indiana — they pushed the Cavs to seven games, with Bird giving his best performance of the series in Game 6: 16 points and 14 assists in a 122-91 home win.

But Game 7 in Cleveland belonged to the Cavs, 122-104, with Bird limited to 12 points in 33 minutes. Cleveland reached the conference finals for the first time since 1976 — and the last time until 2007 — while Bird added one last chapter to his career by winning gold with the Dream Team that summer, then announcing his retirement.

All in a day’s work. The confidence in the move from Mbappe is a trait that he’s showed all season long. Yes, there’s an offside argument to be made, but sometimes the flag stays down and we get to witness something beautiful. The way he feinted to put Stephane Ruffier on the turf defied explanation. Cool and calm under pressure, Mbappe just slotted it into the open net and Monaco were on their way.

With the 2-0 win on day, Monaco will be set to celebrate their first title since the 1999/2000 season. The club toyed with jinxing themselves after announcing rapper 50 Cent would be on hand for their title-winning celebrations, but managed to avoid looking like they’d put the cart before the horse. Fun fact: Mbappe was just 5 years old when 50 Cent’s “In da Club” came out in 2003.

Hopefully Mbappe is a fan of the oldies.

Almirola suffered a compression fracture of his T5 vertebra in a hard crash Saturday night during the Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway.

The incident, which brought out a caution on Lap 201 of the 267-lap race, began in Turn 1, when a right-front brake rotor appeared to fail on Joey Logano’s Team Penske Ford as he and Danica Patrick were racing for 11th place.

Logano’s Ford veered left into Patrick’s car putting it into the wall. Almirola was about 10 cars behind but was unable to stop and hit Logano at a high rate of speed.

Rescue workers had to cut the roof and windshield off of Almirola’s No. 43 RPM Ford to extricate him from the car. He was airlifted to a local hospital where he spent the night before returning home to Mooresville, N.C. on Sunday.

Earlier this week, Almirola met with doctors to get his injury evaluated.

Friday morning at 11 a.m. at the track, Almirola will meet with the media for an update on his progress and prognosis.

He picked former FBI Director Robert Mueller

Washington (CNN) In announcing the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the presidential election, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he made the move in part because of the ""unique circumstances of this matter.""

By choosing former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve , Rosenstein picked an FBI veteran with broad support on both sides of the aisle and sterling reputation. The move takes Justice Department leadership out of the equation and clears the way for Mueller to have the resources to conduct the investigation.

The code of federal regulations provides that the attorney general will appoint a special counsel when the attorney general ""determines that criminal investigation is warranted and that an investigation by the Justice Department would present a conflict of interest 'or other extraordinary circumstance' and that 'under the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside special counsel.""

Because of the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a campaign ally of President Donald Trump, the decision to name Mueller was made by Rosenstein.

Muller, however is not strictly independent. Rosenstein will still maintain the ability to fire Mueller.

3,US and EU reject expanding laptop ban to flights from Europe,"Image copyright AFP

US and EU officials have decided against a ban on laptops and tablets in cabin baggage on flights from Europe.

But after a four-hour meeting in Brussels to discuss the threats to aviation security, officials said other measures were still being considered.

US officials had previously said they were looking into extending to Europe a ban on electronics on flights from eight mostly Muslim countries.

The measure was introduced over fears a bomb could be concealed in a device.

The meeting was requested by EU officials after recent reports suggested US authorities had new information regarding laptop parts being turned into explosives.

Details of a specific threat have not been made public.

An EU source described the briefing as vitally important.

The authorities had been assured by their US colleagues that the meeting signalled the start of an era of better communication on security issues under President Donald Trump.

The US restrictions, introduced in March, apply to devices ""larger than a smartphone"" from the cabins of flights from Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

The UK issued a similar ban on flights from six countries.

3. HP Laptop 15

Big specs, small cost

Lots of configuration options

Plenty of colors

Limited battery life

Hefty

There's some hefty grunt under the shell of this HP Laptop 15 and there are some great prices available as well. Even with the Intel Pentium processor and 4GB of RAM to start, this laptop will whip through pretty much any day-to-day activity you can throw at it without the juddering performance of even cheaper laptops. Hell, it'll even have a decent crack at playing a few of the less demanding games out there if you equip it with an Intel Core processor.

4. Acer Swift 3

Limited expansion options

From afar, this laptop might be mistaken for a MacBook Air, which tells you a lot about its level of quality. Replete with an all-metal frame, this is probably one of the best-looking laptops for under 500 bucks. There are plenty of ports (old and new), 4GB of RAM and up to 512GB in solid-state storage. The cheapest models have a respectable Intel Core i3 processor, but you can get the more powerful i5 versions if you need that extra kick. Another dig at Apple? Unlike the Air, this laptop sports a fully HD screen.

The best deals on our favorite laptops

We've reviewed loads of laptops over the years: we've seen the good ones, the great ones and the ones to avoid. Sometimes, the best laptops pop up online at some truly deal-tastic prices. In this section, we list the very best laptops out there and the best deals on each one.

1. Dell XPS 13

Dell's latest Ultrabook is simply the best laptop in the world

CPU: Intel Core i3 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB | Screen: 13.3-inch QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) | Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD

Same long-lasting battery

Faster than ever

Still poor webcam position

No Windows Hello

The Dell XPS 13 is, bar none, the best laptop you can buy today. It features a revolutionary design that's astonishingly thin and light. Fitting a 13.3-inch screen into such a small frame means Dell has created a nearly borderless Infinity display. It's a powerful and long lasting machine even by today's Ultrabook standards. The XPS 13 comes outfitted with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors plus lighting, quick storage and memory, all while coming in at a very affordable starting price. For these reasons, it easily takes the top slot as the best Ultrabook and the best overall laptop.

2. Asus Zenbook UX305

This laptop should cost a lot more than it does

CPU: 900MHz Intel Core M3-6Y30 (dual-core, 4MB cache, up to 2.2GHz) | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 8GB DDR3 | Screen: 13.3-inch FHD 1920 x 1080 | Storage: 256GB SSD

Incredibly thin and light

Vibrant, glare-free screen

Excellent inputs

Weak graphics power

This is one of the best value Ultrabooks on the market and has been on our shortlist for a few months already. Its price has gone up marginally because of the exchange rate but with a gorgeous finish, a full HD display and a Core M CPU for under £600, it's the one to beat.

3. Acer Aspire S 13

Proof the MacBook Air is getting old

CPU: Intel Core i3 – i7 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 520 – 620 | RAM: 4GB – 8GB | Screen: 13.3-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) anti-glare IPS touch | Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD

High performance

Decent battery life

Great prices

Shell feels a little cheap

Arguably, the MacBook Air is no more, but the clones never stop coming. Among them is the Acer Aspire S 13. It’s not quite as thin and light as many prominently featured Ultrabooks, nor is it particularly premium. However, the Aspire S 13 packs quite a punch when it comes to performance. USB-C and a full HD display put it just over the edge in beating out the 13-inch Air, and for a much lower cost. Despite the powerful CPU, the Acer Aspire S 13 even manages a battery life of 7 hours and 49 minutes, according to our testing.

4. Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming

Gaming on a budget done right

CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 | Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 – 1050 Ti; Intel HD Graphics 620 | RAM: 8GB – 32GB | Screen: 15.6-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) – UHD (3,840 x 2,160) anti-glare | Storage: 256GB – 512GB SSD; 512GB – 1TB HDD; 8GB SSHD

Stellar battery life

Ports for days

Screen is lacking

It is relatively pricey, but this Inspiron absolutely nails it when it comes to value, especially for hardcore gamers. This is among the strongest laptops housing Nvidia's new, low-end GTX 1050 graphics chips. The latest Intel Core series processors, full HD displays and tons of storage options make the Inspiron 15 Gaming a fine solution for PC gamers on a budget.

5. Lenovo Yoga Book

Is this the netbook of the future – the ultra netbook?

CPU: Quad-core Intel Atom x5 | Graphics: Intel HD 400 | RAM: 4GB | Screen: 10.1-inch (1,920 x 1,200) LED | Storage: 64GB flash

Insanely thin and light

Halo Keyboard surprisingly accurate

Underpowered

Dated microUSB port

Lenovo has crafted a brilliant, forward-thinking device that could very well create a subcategory in computing all of its own. The modest specs hold it back from taking on the big boys in terms of raw power, but the innovative digital touchpad keyboard and drawing surface look like trendsetters to us. The Android version is currently about $100 cheaper than the Windows one (click ""see all prices"" above to see all options).

6. Asus Chromebook Flip

The premium Chromebook is finally affordable

CPU: Intel Pentium 4405Y – Intel Core m3-6Y30 | Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 | RAM: 4GB | Screen: 12.5-inch, FHD (1,920 x 1,080) LED backlit anti-glare | Storage: 32GB – 64GB eMMC

Elegant tablet mode

Tactile keyboard

No out-of-box Android app support

Middling speakers

Before Asus's latest flipping Chromebook came around, pickings were slim when it came to affordable models with full-on Intel Core processors and 1080p displays, not to mention touchscreens, backlit keyboards and USB-C ports. It may use an Intel Pentium chip on the low-end, but the Asus Chromebook Flip is by no means low-end. Compared to what’s offered by the competition, the Asus Chromebook Flip’s value is unparalleled, and that’s without getting into its pristine tablet mode, which blows other hybrids completely out of the water.

7. Microsoft Surface Pro 4

The tablet that can replace your laptop

Larger, sharper screen

Vastly improved Type Cover

Type Cover still sold separately

Tiny battery life improvements

Can a tablet really replace your laptop or home PC? That's still up for debate, but the best tablet trying to make that happen is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – and it does a fine job with the full blown version of Windows 10, an integrated kickstand and optional keyboard attachment. Great for for creative professionals, students and everyday folks alike – it's only the premium price that pushes it down the list, but if you're willing to pay for it, you're getting a lot of power – a lot.

6,"Analysis: For Donald Trump, Robert Mueller offers short-term relief, long term risk","Outgoing FBI director Robert Mueller and James Comey, his successor, in the Rose Garden in 2013 (Photo: PAUL J. RICHARDS, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department's appointment of a special counsel to investigate the growing Russia quagmire has given President Trump short-term relief but long-term risks.

On a day the president watched his support among some Republicans fracture and congressional inquiries gain steam, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller to take over the agency's investigation of Moscow's meddling in last year's election, a controversy that includes questions of collusion by Trump associates.

The appointment calmed escalating demands for an independent inquiry from Democrats. It was also welcomed by some congressional Republicans who had been watching any hopes of major legislative initiatives being sidelined by political scandal. But for Trump, the appointment of a special counsel means that the investigation is likely to last not for months but for years. And Mueller is seen as an experienced and highly respected figure who will follow the inquiry wherever it goes.

A special counsel was ""necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome,"" Rosenstein said in a statement.

Read more:

Trump, who reportedly wasn't consulted about the appointment before it was made, released a three-sentence statement. ""A thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,"" he said. ""I look forward to this matter concluding quickly.""

That's not likely. Special counsels typically aren't quick, and they can be unpredictable.

Just ask Bill and Hillary Clinton, The appointment of Kenneth Starr to investigate an Arkansas land transaction known as Whitewater initially was supported by some Clinton White House aides trying to staunch a political controversy. But it morphed into a broader investigation of President Clinton and his personal misbehavior in the White House. It led ultimately to his 1998 impeachment by the House, although he wasn't convicted by the Senate.

The Trump administration previously had dismissed the need for an independent inquiry. ""There's frankly no need for a special prosecutor,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the other day.

But the appointment came after a cascade of extraordinary disclosures in the space of two weeks: Congressional testimony by former acting attorney general Sally Yates about her warnings to the White House that forced the departure of national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump's decision to fire Comey, saying in an interview the Russia investigation was one reason. And reports that Comey had written contemporaneous memos after Trump in February asked if he could let the Flynn investigation ""go.""

Now the president can't count on the loyalty of officials in his administration to protect him — not Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has been forced to recuse himself from the Russia inquiry because of his own contacts during the campaign with the Russian ambassador, nor whomever Trump names to succeed James Comey to head the FBI.

Mueller isn't beholden to Trump for his job. His conclusions could answer the question of what Trump's campaign did and whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry — an allegation that critics say could amount to an impeachable offense. Arizona Sen. John McCain, a maverick Republican, said Tuesday night it was of ""Watergate size and scale.""

Trump was defiant in a commencement address Wednesday at the Coast Guard Academy, an occasion that presidents typically have used to focus on the graduating class' dedication and the national security challenges they will face. He did some of that but also complained about his own treatment in office.

""Look at the way I've been treated lately, especially by the media,"" he said. ""No politician in history, and I say with surety, has been treated worse, more unfairly."" Other presidents, from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton, have decried their treatment in the news media, though none at this early stage of their tenures.

As of Wednesday, Trump had been president for just 118 days.

6,"7 things to know about Robert Mueller, new special counsel for Russia investigation","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Robert Mueller will oversee the Russia investigation. Here's a look at his background. USA TODAY

Mueller is sworn in on Capitol Hill on June 13, 2013, prior to testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)

WASHINGTON – Robert S. Mueller III, the former FBI director tapped by the Justice Department on Wednesday to be a special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, has spent most of his life in public service.

Mueller, 72, was named to head the FBI one week before the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks – and spent the next 12 years at the helm of the agency, a tenure second in length only to J. Edgar Hoover.

At his confirmation hearings, Mueller vowed that his highest priority would be “to restore the public’s confidence in the FBI.""

Mueller’s arrival to the FBI came after turbulent times that included the agency's deadly confrontation with Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas; the discovery of FBI agent-turned-Russian-spy Robert Hanssen; and the disclosure of documents withheld from lawyers representing convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. By many accounts, Mueller succeeded. When Mueller stepped down as FBI chief in 2013, he was praised by frequent FBI critic Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., who called the New York City native “a great American.”

​Now, he has a new challenge: Overseeing the FBI's ongoing counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia. His appointment comes after revelations earlier this week that the abruptly fired FBI director James Comey kept notes of a February meeting indicating Trump asked him to close the agency's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Those who know him say he's the ideal choice. ""Bob Mueller is an outstanding choice because he is apolitical and follows the rule of law, and follows the evidence wherever it leads, regardless of political outcomes,"" said John Pistole, a former FBI deputy director, under Mueller.

Here are seven things to know about the man who will oversee the probe into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia in last year’s election:

Mueller is known for answering the call to public service

Mueller is an Ivy League-educated lawyer with an elite prep school grounding, who was born in New York City and raised outside of Philadelphia.

He has had several successful stints of public service, including three years as an officer in the Marine Corps. He led a rifle platoon during the Vietnam War, earning several medals, including the Purple Heart.

After earning a law degree he spent a few years in private practice before he began a 12-year stint in U.S. attorney offices. He again went into private practice, only to return to government service, where he was put in charge of the Department of Justice’s criminal division in 1990.

He left for private practice again and returned to become U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California where in 2001 he was tapped to become FBI director.

He headed the FBI longer than anyone since J. Edgar Hoover

After President George W. Bush tapped him for the top law enforcement job in 2001, Mueller served through most of 2013 – going over the usual 10-year limit on FBI directors, which was imposed to prevent reigns as long as Hoover’s 50 years. President Obama said continuity and stability was needed at the FBI at a time when the United States faced ongoing security threats, and leadership changes at the Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency. The Senate unanimously approved the extension of his term. He was succeeded by Comey in September 2013.

Mueller was widely praised as a transformative director of the FBI

Mueller assumed leadership of the FBI just weeks before suicide hijackers slammed commercial airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. During the difficult aftermath, he was widely credited with transforming the bureau from a purely law enforcement agency to a intelligence-driven organization to confront the looming terror threat. It was President George W. Bush's terse, post-9/11 order – ""Don't ever let this happen again'' – that prompted Mueller's make-over of the bureau to an agency designed to thwart, rather than respond to, terror threats.

Former Attorney General John Ashcroft said back in 2013 that Mueller projected an air of “total integrity” that began to restore the FBI’s standing at a very critical time. Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff predicted Mueller would be known as “the most transformative director in the history of the FBI since Hoover.”

For a guy used to high-profile roles, Mueller doesn’t like the spotlight

Though he directed the highest profile law enforcement agency during one of the most momentous times in recent U.S. history, Mueller has eschewed the public spotlight at almost every opportunity. He did not travel with an entourage, rarely sat for media interviews and was famous for logging grueling hours, often starting days before sunrise and leaving well after dark.

“That’s how he survived…because he kept a low profile,” said Pistole, Mueller's former No. 2 who now leads Indiana's Anderson University. “He would let his and the bureau’s work speak for itself.”

Mueller’s ‘House of Cards’ moment as FBI director

Probably the strangest incident that Robert Mueller was part of during his tenure as FBI director occurred on the night of March 4, 2004.

That night Mueller and James Comey, then a deputy to Attorney General John D. Ashcoft, raced, sirens blaring, to the hospital intensive care unit where Ashcroft lay ill.

They had been tipped off that White House Counsel Albert Gonzales and President George W. Bush’s chief of staff, Andrew Card, were on their way to the hospital in an attempt to persuade Ashcroft to reauthorize Bush’s domestic surveillance program, which the Justice Department had just determined was illegal.

Mueller and Comey won the race. Ashcroft, who was able to lift his head and speak, refused to sign the papers that Gonzales and Card brought with them.

Mueller investigated NFL handling of Ray Rice punishment

Even in retirement, Mueller has found his services in steady demand.

The National Football League tapped Mueller in 2014 to conduct an independent investigation into claims that league officials had received and viewed an elevator video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice beating his then-fiancé Janay Palmer at a casino in Atlantic City, N.J. in February of that year.

Mueller was called in after the NFL suspended Rice for two games but before the graphic video surfaced on the celebrity web site TMZ., sparking national outrage and accusations that the NFL was suppressing evidence to protect one if its star players. Once the video was released, NFL Commissioner suspended Rice indefinitely.

After a four-month investigation, Mueller concluded that no one at the NFL headquarters had received or reviewed the tape before the initial punishment against Rice despite an Associated Press report that an unnamed woman at the league office in New York City had acknowledged receipt.

But the former FBI director also said there was “substantial information about the incident that should have put the league on notice of a need to undertake a more thorough investigation” that might have turned up the video earlier.

Mueller’s integrity was tapped again recently for air bag case

Last month, a federal court judge appointed Mueller to serve as “special master” and oversee the disbursement of nearly $1 billion in restitution in the Takata Corp. case involving defective air bags.

Takata pleaded guilty in February to fraud charges. There have been at least 11 deaths and 180 injuries in the United States linked to the defective air bags. The case also involves a recall of 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles in the United States.

U.S. District Judge George Steeh wrote in his order last month that he chose Mueller in part because of the “court’s comfort and trust in his impeccable credentials, his relevant experience in settlement negotiations, his familiarity with the automotive industry in general, and based upon his well-known reputation for integrity.”

Mueller was also named the “settlement master” in 2016 to negotiate settlements in the Volkswagen excess diesel emissions scandal.

4,A Teenager Died After Drinking Too Much Caffeine,"Davis Allen Cripe died in a hospital on April 26 after collapsing in a classroom at Spring Hill High School in Chapin.

On Monday, the Richland County Coroner ruled that he died from a ""caffeine-induced cardiac event causing a probable arrhythmia.""

""Davis, on this particular day within the two hours prior to his death, had consumed a large diet Mountain Dew, a cafe latte from McDonald's, and also some type of energy drink,"" coroner Gary Watts said at a press conference.

Watts could not specify which energy drink Cripe consumed.

""It was so much caffeine at the time of his death that it caused arrhythmia,"" Watts sad, referring to a condition marked by an irregular heartbeat.

Watts told BuzzFeed News that according to eyewitnesses the biggest issue was that Davis ""slammed or chugged the regular-sized energy drink 15 minutes before he passed out.""

""That was the biggest issue, how he consumed that energy drink,"" Watts said.

Davis did not use alcohol or drugs and the autopsy did not reveal any underlying medical conditions that may have played a role in his death, the coroner said.

""This is not an addictive type of situation with him at all,” he added.

Based on his weight, Davis's intake of caffeine exceeded what is considered to be a safe level in that time period of two hours, Watts told BuzzFeed News.",buzzfeed
