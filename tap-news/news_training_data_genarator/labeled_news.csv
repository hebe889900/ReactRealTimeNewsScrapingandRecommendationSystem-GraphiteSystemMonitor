6,4 ways Trump miscalculated the Comey firing,"(CNN) Donald Trump has been president for 110 days. In that time, he has fired an acting attorney general, his national security adviser, dozens of federal prosecutors, including one who was investigating him , and, on Tuesday night, the director of the FBI, James Comey.

While each decision has threatened to kick off a crisis -- one could argue that many Americans are now in a perpetual state of minor alarm -- the decision to sack Comey landed differently.

So what did Trump, who is nothing if not savvy about how the press and public will react to his every utterance, think was going to happen? Because this is surely not how he planned his Wednesday. Based on what we know about his decision-making process, Trump appears to have made four fundamental miscalculations.

1. He thought Democrats would pull their punches

It's no secret that most Democrats, especially Clinton supporters and allies, are not exactly Comey superfans. Many of them, including Clinton herself , believe that she would be president today if he had not delivered his now-infamous letter to Congress on October 28, 2016.

As the administration has repeatedly noted, top Democrats were tough on Comey in the aftermath. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was singled out by the White House -- and Trump, in a tweet -- for his harsh words.

Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, ""I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."" Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

""I'm surprised (Comey's firing) did create a divide since you've had so many Republicans and Democrats repeatedly calling for Director Comey to be gone,"" deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during her Wednesday briefing.

Her remark was meant as a rejoinder to Democratic criticism, but one wonders if she was channeling Trump's very real confusion.

2. He expected Republicans to keep the wagons circled tight

Though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively backed him on Wednesday morning, dismissing Democrats' outrage as mere partisan rancor, and Sens. Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins were supportive, a number of Republicans seemed rattled too.

House Speaker Paul Ryan was silent on the matter for nearly 24 hours before falling in line with McConnell Wednesday evening. And Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, of North Carolina, on Tuesday expressed serious reservations. He wasn't alone.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of director Comey's termination,"" Burr said in a statement. Arizona Sen. John McCain too said he was ""disappointed"" by the firing. Even Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, an early Trump ally, conceded that Comey's ""removal at this particular time will raise questions.""

But it might have been a tweet from Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, no pal of the President, which cut deepest.

I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just can't do it. — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) May 10, 2017

""I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing,"" he wrote. ""I just can't do it.""

3. He outsmarted himself by trying to use Clinton as a shield

Here is Trump, on October 31, 2016, at a rally Grand Rapids, Michigan. Days earlier, Comey revived the Clinton case in a letter to Congress:

""I really disagreed with (Comey in July when he publicly ended the probe), I was not his fan. But I'll tell you what -- what he did, he brought back his reputation. He brought it back. He's got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. But what he did was the right thing.""

Eight days later, Trump defeated Clinton.

But in the memo written by Rosenstein, presented by the White House as Trump's rationale for acting, Comey's rough remarks about Clinton at the July 5 press conference are singled out for criticism.

""Compounding the error (of making his decision not to recommend charges public),"" Rosenstein wrote, ""the Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation.""

Simply stated, the suggestion that Trump's decision was swayed in any way by Comey's less-than-stellar treatment of Clinton doesn't pass the smell test.

4. He involved Jeff Sessions, casting doubt on integrity of the Justice Department

Former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions was among Trump's earliest and most influential backers. He was the first in the Senate to endorse the candidate and remained a trusted adviser and surrogate throughout the campaign. But during the attorney general's confirmation hearings in January, he failed to disclose his past contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

When those conversations were revealed, Sessions responded by recusing himself from any investigation into Russia's meddling in the campaign.

But when it came time to explain Comey's dismissal, there was Sessions -- front and center. In a memo citing Rosenstein and addressed to Trump, the attorney general said he had ""concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI.""",cnn
6,First on CNN: Comey sends farewell letter to friends and agents,"(CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired Tuesday by President Donald Trump, on Wednesday sent a letter to friends and agents. Here is the text of that letter, which was obtained by CNN.

To all:

I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.

I have said to you before that, in times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people, who together make it that rock for America.

It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing. My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.

6,"Comey committed 'atrocities,' Sarah Huckabee Sanders says","Story highlights The press briefing came one day after the abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey

Sarah Huckabee Sanders filled in for press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday

Washington (CNN) FBI Director James Comey committed ""atrocities"" when investigating former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday.

Sanders addressed journalists just one day after President Donald Trump -- citing the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- fired Comey, who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's interference into the 2016 election. Sanders cited Comey's July news conference which he held without notifying his superiors at the Justice Department.

""I think also having a letter like the one that he (Trump) received, and having that conversation (with Rosenstein) that outlines the basic atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in the Department of Justice,"" Sanders said when asked why Trump's position on Comey changed since the campaign.

""Any person of legal mind and authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in the Department of Justice; particularly for somebody like the deputy attorney general who has been part of the Justice Department for 30 years and is such a respected person,"" she added.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump commended Comey for his decision to send a letter to Congress that suggested the FBI was looking into Clinton's email server again. Many Democrats cite Comey's handling of the investigation as a major reason for Clinton's loss.

16,Sean Spicer under fire during crucial week for Trump,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is out of the briefing room this week, and already there is speculation about his future.

A White House official told CNN that officials at the highest levels, including the president, are monitoring Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' performances as she substitutes for Spicer in the briefing room.

The perception, according to multiple sources inside and close to the White House, is that Spicer has been ""benched"" during a critical week, following the president's termination of FBI director James Comey. And the big question, one source said, is whether it's temporary or permanent.

Spicer isn't handling the daily press briefings from Wednesday to Friday while he is fulfilling his Navy Reserve duty at the Pentagon, which the White House says was previously scheduled. A source close to Spicer told CNN that President Trump personally gave him the OK to take leave, and said Spicer will be present at the White House Wednesday night after his duty is done for the day.

But Sanders offered a ""significant contrast"" in the briefing room Wednesday, said another White House official who added Spicer's reserve duty ""couldn't have come at a worse time for him.""

However, another White House official disputed the notion that Spicer had been sidelined, and sources close to the press secretary stressed the importance of his Reserve duties. ""He has taken his Navy duties very seriously in all the time I've known him,"" one source said. ""So if he's on duty, he's on duty, and I wouldn't read more into that in itself.""

Another source close to Spicer added, ""Keep in mind Sean is following military orders, not military suggestions.""

Whatever Spicer's fate, the scrambled effort to address Comey's firing has revealed something significant about this White House, which is that its press secretary is growing increasingly irrelevant.

Already beset by critics who say he has lost his credibility, Spicer may now be losing his authority. His charge is to tell the media, and the public, what the president is thinking. And yet it is becoming increasingly clear that he is either not able to fulfill that task, or choosing not to.

A little more than three hours before Trump fired Comey, Spicer could not say whether his boss still had ""full confidence"" in Comey. ""I have no reason to believe -- I haven't asked him,"" Spicer said at Tuesday afternoon's White House press briefing. ""So I don't -- I have not asked the President since the last time we spoke about this."" Pressed again, Spicer replied, ""I don't want to start speaking on behalf of the President without speaking to him first.""

Later that night, Spicer stood before reporters outside the White House, in the dark, sounding similarly ignorant of his boss's thinking: Had the president spoken with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about Rosenstein's review of Comey, a reporter wanted to know. ""No, I don't believe, I don't know how that sequence went. I don't know,"" Spicer said. When's the last time Trump and Comey spoke? ""I don't know. I don't know,"" he said. ""There's some. I don't know. I don't know.""

Two senior White House officials were sharply critical of the White House press shop's handling of the Comey news Tuesday night. It was an ""embarrassment,"" one official said. ""A disaster,"" said another, who added that the president himself thought it was ""handled poorly.""

The president ""should be mad,"" one official added. This official said sending Sanders into the briefing room was the right call. ""She does a great job,"" the official said.

Spicer is not scheduled to address reporters at all for the remainder of the week. Instead of briefing, he will be at the Pentagon on duty with the Navy Reserve, with which he has served for nearly two decades. That commitment was ""previously scheduled,"" according to White House communications director Mike Dubke.

Already, Sanders has received some praise for her performance from reporters on Twitter. ""Sanders obfuscates same as Spicer,"" The New York Times' Maggie Haberman tweeted. ""Also does it without making deeply personal, petty, condescending.

Politico reporter Josh Dawsey tweeted a similar sentiment: ""Sarah Sanders parries, spins and obfuscates, too. But she's not condescending and seems comfortable at the podium doing it.""

The job of White House press secretary is far more than just the daily press briefing. The press secretary runs the press office, oversees the White House's public statements and press logistics, and manages a team. Even a great briefer could, as a result, be a bad press secretary. But the president's criteria for what he wants in a press secretary may be more limited -- as CNN has previously reported, Trump watches the briefing almost daily.

Spicer's last public appearance on Tuesday night took place outside the White House. Following an interview on the Fox Business Network, he disappeared behind a hedge and huddled with staff in the darkness. He emerged several minutes later to take questions from the reporters standing between him and his office.

""Just turn the lights off,"" he said, according to the Washington Post's account of his impromptu briefing, asking that he not be filmed. ""Turn the lights off. ... Can you just turn that light off?""

He took questions for about ten minutes. On several occasions, he referred the inquiring reporter to the Justice Department. To others, he said he would have to get back to them once he had the full details.

But on several questions, the refrain was simply, ""I don't know.""",cnn
6,Senate intelligence committee subpoenas Michael Flynn,"Washington (CNN) The Senate intelligence committee Wednesday issued a subpoena to former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for documents regarding his interactions with Russian officials.

The subpoena comes after Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, alerted the panel that he would not provide documents in response to their April 28 request.

Flynn's lawyer declined comment to CNN Wednesday evening.

The subpoena also comes as Senate investigators have aggressively moved on their probe after months of groundwork, and just a few days after now-former FBI Director James Comey alerted the leaders of the intelligence panel the FBI was ramping up its own investigation.

Sen. James Lankford, a Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, told Fox News Wednesday evening that the panel had ""subpoenaed a large number of documents.""

6,A 'white hot' Trump stewed over Comey's fate,"(CNN) President Donald Trump kept his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey extraordinarily close to the vest in the 48 hours leading up to the stunning announcement, people close to the White House said, before ultimately concluding that Comey ""was his own man"" and could not be trusted in a role so pivotal to the presidency.

A longtime friend who talked to the President over the weekend described him as ""white hot,"" a mood that set the table for Comey's firing.

Trump did not seek a wide range of viewpoints on Comey, several people familiar with the matter told CNN, unlike his approach on many difficult choices.

Whether sending more troops to Afghanistan or deciding whether to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, the president often embraces opposing positions, but on Comey there was little room for debate inside the West Wing.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus initially warned of risks associated with abruptly dismissing Comey -- including the fallout for Trump's legislative agenda -- but people familiar with the decision said it was unclear how forcefully Priebus argued his point when it became clear the President was insistent on firing Comey.

""He wasn't doing a good job,"" Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office when asked about Comey. ""Very simply, he was not doing a good job.""

Those sparse words were all the President had to say about why he fired Comey, aside from several messages on Twitter. He did not answer two critical questions about Comey's dismissal: Why and why now?

""The President had lost confidence in Director Comey,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday. ""Frankly he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected.""

Several people familiar with the decision say the President grew increasingly frustrated at Comey after his congressional hearing last Wednesday when he testified that he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the election. Even the health care victory in the House one day later couldn't take his mind off Comey, two people close to Trump said.

""He wouldn't hear it (that he should be encouraged),"" the friend said. ""It's Russia. Russia. Trump and Russia."" The President complained, with expletives, about Comey's ""mildly nauseous"" answer and said his answer when pressed on leaks convinced the President he was far less concerned about the leaks than Trump thought he should be.

Communications team kept in dark

One reason the administration underestimated the explosive fallout, several people close to the White House said, because few seasoned political hands were closely involved in the decision. The White House communications team was kept almost entirely out of the loop until Tuesday afternoon.

Several people close to the White House, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, described it as a stunning and dispiriting turn of events when they were called to defend and explain one of the most controversial decisions of Trump's young presidency ""at almost the same time he pulled the trigger.""

More than 24 hours later, the White House was still explaining the timeline of the Comey decision.

Senior administration officials initially insisted on Tuesday the President was following the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein by firing Comey. The White House, by Wednesday, said the President had long been leery of Comey, despite repeatedly saying he had full confidence in him, and finally made a decision he had been mulling all year.

Both explanations were undercut by the president's own letter to Comey, which made clear Russia investigation was at the root of his frustration.

""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation,"" Trump wrote. ""I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.""

The White House declined to produce evidence of the three separate occasions the president referenced.

Asked whether the president regretted not firing Comey immediately upon taking office, Sanders had a quick answer.

""No,"" Sanders said. ""I think the president wanted to give Director Comey a chance.""

Trump has over the course of past couple months several times expressed frustration ""they can't all just make this go away.""

""He was mad at Sessions when he recused. Really mad,"" the friend said. ""Mad at his lawyer and the staff. Mad at you guys on TV. Mad at the committees. Mad at Comey. """,cnn
6,Rod Rosenstein: Trump's unlikely hatchet man,"(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emerged this week as perhaps the most unlikely character in the politically charged drama over the firing of FBI Director James Comey.

Publicly at least, Rosenstein played the role of President Donald Trump's main hatchet man, with the White House pointing repeatedly to his recommendation to terminate Comey as a deciding factor in the president's thinking. It was Rosenstein, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters, who ""brought the recommendation to the president.""

Little in Rosenstein's background suggested such an aggressive or dramatic role.

In more than a quarter-century in government, the Harvard-trained Rosenstein has cultivated an image as a low-key and down-the-middle prosecutor, a political survivor appointed to top jobs by both Democrats and Republicans. ""Straight shooter"" was the innocuous phrase often used to describe him.

First nominated as a United States attorney in Maryland by President George W. Bush, he was so uncontroversial that President Barack Obama kept him on the job. He lasted all eight years of the Obama administration before Trump nominated him for the Justice Department's second-highest post to serve, in effect, as its chief executive officer, and the Senate confirmed him on a 94-6 vote last month in a rare display of near-bipartisanship.

Many senators saw Rosenstein as a sober-minded and independent lawyer who would help steady the Justice Department after the bruising confirmation battle of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose history on race and civil rights became attack points for Democrats. After Sessions' undisclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador forced him to remove himself from any investigation into the Trump campaign's Russia ties, Rosenstein took over the probe.

Rosenstein and Comey had worked together for years, and at his Senate confirmation hearing in March, Rosenstein showed no sign of reservations about Comey's role at the FBI. He mentioned Comey by name twice in saying he would work with him on sensitive political issues.

But barely two weeks into his new job, all that appears to have changed.

There were conflicting accounts about whether Rosenstein acted on his own or at the direction of the White House. But in the end, he sent over a memo to Trump lambasting Comey's judgment in his public handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

The Justice Department said Rosenstein was not available for comment.

Trump fired Comey late Tuesday just hours after receiving Rosenstein's formal recommendation, which attempted to give the firing a somewhat less raw and political veneer.

Rosenstein's key role in the drama surprised a number of his current and former colleagues at the Justice Department, leaving some to wonder whether he acted on his own or felt obliged to carry out Trump's wishes.

""It's not consistent that he walked in here with a hit list and James Comey's name was on the top of it. That's inconsistent with who he is and what everyone says,"" one law enforcement official said. ""This doesn't pass the smell test of Rod Rosenstein.""

His prominence in the firing also threatened to undermine the integrity of the ongoing Russia probe and to further damage relations between the Justice Department and the FBI, where Comey maintains some support.

""The relationship between FBI and Justice before yesterday was already bad, but after this, it's really toxic,"" said a former federal prosecutor who worked with both Rosenstein and Comey.

Rosenstein's part in the firing drew even more scrutiny Tuesday after reports that Comey had gone to him just last week to seek more resources for the FBI's Russia investigation.

""It just seemed really odd that he would be let go right after that,"" said a former senior FBI agent.

Trump administration officials, however, denied that Comey had asked Rosenstein for more resources for the Russia investigation, and they dismissed any suggestion that Rosenstein's recommendation had anything to do with Russia.

""Everybody across the board has unequivocally said this guy is a man of upstanding character,"" said White House Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, ""and essentially the gold standard at the Department of Justice.""

6,General election 2017: Labour manifesto draft leaked,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC political correspondent Chris Mason takes a look at what's in the leaked draft Labour manifesto

A draft of Labour's general election manifesto has been leaked, including plans to nationalise parts of the energy industry and scrap tuition fees.

The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday.

It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal.

Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it ""a shambles"".

According to the draft, Labour would:

Spend an extra £8bn on social care over the next Parliament

Refuse to make ""false promises"" on immigration

Stress that any leader should be ""extremely cautious"" about using Trident nuclear weapons, which leader Jeremy Corbyn opposes

Strengthen trade union rights - including increased unionisation across the workforce and repealing last year's Trade Union Act

Scrap the public sector pay cap and reintroduce national pay bargaining

Ban so-called ""zero hours"" contracts

Increase income tax for the highest earning 5% to raise an extra £6bn for the NHS

Build at least 100,000 council and housing association houses a year

Reserve 4,000 homes for rough sleepers

On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids.

First it would introduce an ""immediate emergency price cap"" of £1,000 a year.

The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee.

The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election.

A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few.""

Analysis by BBC political correspondent Chris Mason

Image copyright Reuters

The publication of a manifesto is meant to be a huge set-piece moment for any party.

A moment that is choreographed, as what could become their governing manual is published with fanfare.

Instead, on the eve of the draft being formally signed off, a series of leaks, which tell their own story, about the divisions and lack of discipline within a party just four weeks from polling day.

Remember, the final document hasn't yet been signed off.

But there is meaty stuff in this, which some people will delight in seeing a big party advocate at a general election.

Others will label it a throwback to a different political era.

Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign.

These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported.

On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called ""bedroom tax"" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21.

The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66.

The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph.

A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed.

""The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk.""

In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.

Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually.

Labour is also promising to meet the 2% Nato pledge.",bbc-news

A cold-calling firm has been fined a record £400,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for making almost 100 million nuisance calls.

Keurboom Communications made unsolicited automated calls relating to road-accident and insurance-policy compensation, the ICO said.

It breached privacy laws by calling people without their consent.

The company has since gone into liquidation but the ICO said it was committed to recovering the fine.

It said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about automated calls from the Bedfordshire-registered company.

Hidden identity

The ICO said Keurboom Communications called some people repeatedly and during unsociable hours.

It also hid its identity so that people would find it harder to complain.

""Keurboom showed scant regard for the rules,"" said Steve Eckersley, head of enforcement at the ICO.

""The unprecedented scale of its campaign and Keurboom's failure to co-operate with our investigation has resulted in the largest fine issued by the Information Commissioner for nuisance calls.""

In October, the Government announced plans to let the ICO fine company directors as well as their businesses.

""Making directors responsible will stop them avoiding fines by putting their company into liquidation,"" the ICO said.

The watchdog said 2016/17 had been its busiest year for nuisance call investigations, with 23 companies fined a total of £1.9m.",bbc-news
3,Austria convicts asylum seeker of Syria war crimes,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The suspect is said to have claimed responsibility for 20 deaths in Homs

An asylum seeker has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a court in Austria after being found guilty of killing 20 people in Syria.

The 27-year-old man was accused of shooting unarmed or wounded soldiers following a battle in the city of Homs.

The man, who has not been named, had denied the charges. He was arrested in western Austria in June.

It is thought to be the first time that a case involving war crimes in Syria have been tried in Austria.

The sentence was handed down by a court in Innsbruck, the Austria Press Agency reports.

Previous reports in local media said the man had told others at a refugee shelter that he had shot dead government soldiers when he was fighting with an Islamist rebel group called the Farouq Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army.

But his lawyers said his account of events was mistranslated and that he was expected to appeal against his conviction.

According to Der Standard, he is a stateless Palestinian who grew up in a refugee camp in Homs.

The suspect was placed under investigation when officials were alerted to his account of events in Syria last year.

Austria is unable to extradite the man to face charges in Syria because of the ongoing civil war there.

Killing injured soldiers is prohibited under the Geneva Convention.

Officials had previously said the actions that he had allegedly described qualified as terrorism and could be prosecuted under international counter-terrorism agreements.",bbc-news
10,Intel and HP to get smart with Cortana-powered devices,"The Build conference is underway in Seattle, and Microsoft is pushing hard with AI and Cortana, with an announcement that both Intel and HP have signed up to produce hardware featuring the digital assistant.

Following in the footsteps of Harman Kardon’s Cortana-powered speaker (Invoke – which is pictured above), HP will also make similar devices, along with Intel – and the latter is promising to knock up reference designs for Cortana-driven devices.

This is according to a TechCrunch report, but other than the actual partnerships and basic intentions of these companies, no details have actually been revealed about the gadgets we might see forthcoming.

We may hear more about HP and Intel’s potential creations as Build progresses, so keep your peepers peeled on TechRadar today and tomorrow.

Smart money

The smart home will potentially be a major market, so it’s little surprise that Microsoft has started to push Cortana into the various IoT gadgets that will furnish said homes.

A big piece of Microsoft’s smart home puzzle was put in place recently with the Creators Update, which brought Cortana support to Windows 10 IoT Core, and thus potentially to all manner of gadgets from smart fridges to thermostats (and indeed the Raspberry Pi 3, for tinkerers building their own smart home stuff).

As for Harman Kardon’s Invoke speaker, that’s expected to be available in the fall. There’s plenty of competition for Microsoft and partners, of course, in terms of Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Move on over Alexa

Also at Build today, Microsoft announced that its Cortana Skills Kit is now in public preview. The kit allows enterprising developers connect their apps and services to Cortana. On stage Microsoft demonstrated a few use cases including ordering pizza through Domino’s, playing music on iHeartRadio and looking up only the most important information on Cat Facts.

What's more, Microsoft promises they will work across platforms including Windows 10, Android and iOS, as well as with standalone Cortana devices like the Invoke.

10,Sprint joins the race to roll out 5G with plans for 2019,"Not wanting to be left behind by the likes of AT&T and Verizon, another major telecom company is making plans to support 5G connectivity.

Sprint announced today that it's made a joint agreement with Qualcomm and SoftBank to build new technologies for a 2.5GHz 5G service.

The carrier plans to have commercially available 5G services and devices ready for the public sometime ""in late 2019,"" but had little else to add, saying that additional details will be provided later by either itself and its partner companies.

5G may be on its way, but it won't be an overnight process. AT&T has not yet given a definitive time frame when to expect a 5G rollout, and Verizon is still prepping a pilot program in a limited number of cities for later this year.

Sprint's jump into 5G technologies also follows just over a week after T-Mobile's announcement to roll out 5G services of its own, which expects to have something commercially available starting in late 2019 and into 2020.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere made claims that his company was the first among competitors to announce plans for ""truly nationwide"" 5G, saying that AT&T and Verizon's current plans-in-development rely too much on limited hotspots instead of wide-spread coverage.

As for Sprint, it's unclear if its plans for ""accelerated wide-scale 5G deployments"" more closely match T-Mobile or AT&T/Verizon's strategy, but one thing is clear: the race to the next cellular standard is on — even if we won't see major results for at least another two years.",techradar

6,Comey's fired. Here's what we know about probes into Trump campaign and Russia,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey raises a ton of questions, including how this will affect the FBI and congressional investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.

Here's what we know — and what we still don't know.

Why did Trump fire Comey?

First, let's start off with the basics.

In recommending Comey's firing, the Justice Department leadership excoriated the FBI director for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of State.

In a letter released by the White House, Trump said he agreed with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and newly-confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Comey ""was not able to effectively lead the bureau."" As Trump told reporters on Wednesday: ""Very simply, he was not doing a good job.""

But wasn't he running the FBI's Russia investigation?

Yes. Comey in March confirmed publicly the FBI was conducting a counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year's election. Trump has repeatedly denied any connections and has dismissed the Russia story as a ""hoax"" from Democrats committed to sabotaging his presidency.

White House aides spent all of Wednesday arguing the timing of the firing had nothing to do with the agency's ongoing investigation.

Where does the FBI's Russia probe stand now?

That's what everyone wants to know.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Russia investigations will ""continue whether Jim Comey is there or not.""

“Any investigation that was happening on Monday, is still happening today. We encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday. “Nobody wants this to be finished and completed more than us.”

But Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., expressed concern on Wednesday that the investigation would continue in full force, confirming reports that Comey had asked for more money for the FBI's probe of Russia's interference in the election days before being fired. “I’m told that as soon as Rosenstein arrived, there was a request for additional resources for the investigation and that a few days afterwards he (Comey) was sacked,"" said Durbin, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Justice Department and FBI.

Durbin said he did not know the details of the request, which The New York Times reported the FBI director made to Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the Russia investigation who also recommended Trump fire Comey. Durbin also said he did not have direct evidence that the request was related to Comey’s firing. But he had a general takeaway: “I think the Comey operation was breathing down the neck of the Trump campaign and their operatives and this was an effort to slow down the investigation.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Comey made no request for additional funding or personnel in meetings with Rosenstein. “No resources — personnel, money or otherwise,’’ Flores said. “That is false.’’

If the FBI doesn't investigate, who could?

Democrats are unifying around the call for a special prosecutor. If Trump were truly upset with Comey about his handling of the Clinton probe, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, he could have fired Comey on his first day in office. Instead, Schumer said, the president waited until Congress and FBI investigations into Russia heated up.

""Given the way the President has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration,"" Schumer said. Without an independent special prosecutor, he added, ""every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.""

How would a special prosecutor be appointed?

Not easily, it turns out.

The responsibility would fall to Rosenstein, who wrote Tuesday’s memo justifying Comey’s firing. While Attorney General Jeff Sessions has legal authority to make the appointment, he has recused himself from investigations relating to the 2016 campaign after his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, came to light.

The post-Watergate independent counsel law that gave Congress the authority to call on the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor lapsed in 1999. And passing a new version is unlikely in a GOP-controlled Congress.

An independent counsel isn’t needed, Sanders said, because Congress is also investigating — and because Rosenstein, who is overseeing the Justice Department’s probe, “is about as independent as it comes.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Schumer said Rosenstein’s role in Comey’s dismissal had cast “serious doubts” on his impartiality. Democrats now say the authority to name a special prosecutor should fall instead to the highest-ranking career civil servant at the Justice Department.

So will Congress take any action, then?

There are five key committees looking at aspects of Russia's involvement in the election.

After the U.S. intelligence community accused Moscow of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks against Democratic political organizations, and leaking the stolen information to websites such as WikiLeaks with the goal of undermining public confidence in the election, congressional panels offered to take up the charge.

So far, though, there have been some hearings, but little definitive progress — at least that's visible to the outside observer.

Here's where things stand:

Senate Intelligence Committee:

The committee hasn’t held open hearings on its Russia probe since it heard from some academic witnesses on Russian “disinformation” efforts on March 30.

On May 5, committee leaders asked four Trump campaign associates — including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign advisers Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone — to provide records of meetings with Russian officials. The committee announced late Wednesday that it sent a subpoena to Flynn for Russia-related documents.

Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday night that he was “troubled by the timing” of Comey’s firing, adding it “confuses an already difficult investigation.” Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said it was “shocking” that Comey was fired “during an active counterintelligence investigation into improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.” He tweeted that the situation ""demands the appointment of a Special Counsel.""

But some members of this investigating panel might not support a special prosecutor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a member of the panel, said Wednesday such an appointment “would probably shut down our ability to do our work because a significant amount of information would now be denied on the basis of an ongoing investigation.” He urged patience in letting the committee continue its work.

Comey has been invited to testify before the committee during a closed hearing next Tuesday.

House Intelligence Committee:

This panel’s effort is stalled, with staff continuing to go through evidence but no hearings scheduled. After Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., recused himself from the probe and handed the matter over to Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, the committee heard from Comey in a May 4 closed session — but that's about it.

Nunes stepped aside after reviewing evidence at the White House he said proved some Trump associates were inadvertently caught up in surveillance by the intelligence community of legitimate foreign agents during the presidential transition. Nunes shared that information with Trump — before informing fellow committee members, prompting calls for his ouster.

With this as a backdrop, the panel's top Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, questioned whether the White House was inappropriately interfering in the probe after Comey’s firing Tuesday. ""The decision by a president whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an attorney general who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” he said.

Conaway spokeswoman Emily Hytha said he has not addressed the Comey firing, adding the committee’s investigation will continue “as planned.”

Senate Judiciary Committee:

This committee, which has been one of the most publicly active in its investigation, hosted two hearings that provided critical information in recent days.

The hearing with Comey appeared to be part of the impetus for his eventual firing. On May 3, Comey said in his appearance before the panel that “hundreds and thousands"" of emails had ended up on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop because of Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin. Comey said Abedin made a ""regular practice"" of forwarding emails to her now-estranged husband.

But it turned out that Comey misspoke. After ProPublica reported Monday night that his testimony was not accurate, the FBI issued a statement the next day to the committee attempting to clear things up. That was just hours before Comey’s firing was announced.

Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Tuesday it was within Trump’s right to fire Comey after the FBI director had lost the public’s trust. Grassley also criticized the way Comey had provided information to the committee. But ranking member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praised the way Comey had worked with the panel, calling a past briefing “comprehensive” and “precise.”

On Monday, Senate Judiciary panel hosted former acting attorney general Sally Yates and former director of national intelligence James Clapper. In that hearing, Yates told lawmakers that she was so concerned that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with the Russian ambassador that she warned the White House counsel he was vulnerable to blackmail and could even face criminal charges. Eighteen days later, Flynn was fired.

House Judiciary Committee:

In a non-binding list of activities the committee adopted for the year, the panel promised to “continue to conduct oversight into allegations of misconduct” by the executive branch. Other than that, there hasn’t been much public movement.

Following Tuesday’s developments, ranking member John Conyers, D-Mich., said Comey’s firing “obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election, and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis.” Yet Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., pointed to the recommendations of the attorney general and deputy attorney general in encouraging Trump to fire Comey. “The FBI is the premier law enforcement agency in the world and it is critical to have a director who holds the trust of the American people,” he said.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee:

Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., sent shockwaves through Washington when the they announced last month that Flynn may have broken the law in relation to payments he accepted from Russia for speaking engagements. They came to that conclusion after the committee viewed classified documents related to Flynn.

Cummings said the White House had refused their requests for documents related to Flynn’s tenure. There is ""no data to support the notion that Flynn complied with the law,” Chaffetz said at the time. A Chaffetz spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Comey’s firing, while Cummings called for “immediate emergency hearings to obtain testimony directly from Attorney General Sessions, the deputy attorney general, and FBI Director Comey” for answers.

“There is now a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department, and President Trump is not being held accountable because House Republicans refuse to work with us to do our job,” Cummings said Tuesday.

16,Fox's bill for Roger Ailes settlements is now $45 million,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share 21st Century Fox is in the spotlight Wednesday as investors focus on the company's quarterly earnings report. Video provided by TheStreet Newslook

The parent company of Fox News Channel, Twenty-First Century Fox, has paid $45 million in settlements related to sexual harassment allegations against former CEO Roger Ailes.

In its quarterly report filed Wednesday with the Securities & Exchange Commission, 21st Century Fox (FOX) listed costs of about $45 million during the nine months before the quarter ended March 31, 2017 for ""settlements of pending and potential litigations following"" Ailes' July 2016 resignation and a sexual harassment case filed against him. That's $10 million more than in its previous quarterly report.

Among those payments: a $20 million settlement in September 2016 of former Fox and Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson's sexual harassment lawsuit she filed against Ailes.

The company, which is controlled by billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, continues to seek to recover from a sexual harassment crisis that resulted in several high-profile departures.

Most recently came last week's resignation of network co-head Bill Shine, who had been mentioned in several lawsuits filed against Fox News for allowing a workplace culture in which sexual harassment and racial discrimination could develop. Shine had taken over as co-president along with Jack Abernethy in August 2016, one month after CEO Roger Ailes stepped down in the wake of accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.

Last month, popular host Bill O'Reilly was dismissed after an internal investigation into charges of sexual harassment.

But the Murdochs say Fox News Channel has powered through, remaining the No. 1 basic cable channel in total day and primetime viewing for 61 consecutive quarters. ""Fox News Channel has delivered its highest-rated quarter ever, ratings strength we expect to continue,"" said Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch in a conference call Wednesday with investment analysts

Fox (FOX) shares dipped nearly 2% in after-hours trading to $27.20 after the company posted mixed third-quarter earnings results Wednesday.

Net income of $799 million fell 5%, with adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents, compared to 44 cents last year.

Revenue rose 4.6% to $7.56 billion, short of forecasts. Analysts had expected net income of $883.75 million, according to those polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, along with adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents and revenue of $7.63 billion.

6,Senate Democrats seek Comey’s testimony amid new questions about his ouster,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the timing and motive behind President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.

WASHINGTON — Former FBI director James Comey has been invited to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee during a closed hearing next Tuesday, as the fallout from his sudden and surprising ouster continued to ripple across the Capitol.

President Trump’s Tuesday decision to fire Comey as he led a counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government had Democrats, and even some Republicans, questioning the president’s motives.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that Comey could personally confirm that he had asked the Justice Department, shortly before his firing, for additional resources to advance the ongoing Russia investigation. Justice Department official dispute such a request.

“Wouldn’t it be a good idea for Director Comey to come in and testify to that issue?’’ Warner said Wednesday.

The Senate’s Democratic leader, Charles Schumer of New York, said reports that Comey met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week to request more resources for the probe ""would make the timing of this firing even more suspect.""

Schumer said Comey must come before the Senate ""in some capacity,"" and he pressed Republicans on Wednesday to convene two private and possibly classified briefings for all senators, where they could separately grill Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation earlier this year. Both Sessions and Rosenstein recommended Comey's dismissal.

“There are a great many outstanding questions about the circumstances of Comey’s dismissal,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor.

Schumer’s request for a classified briefing was a “surprise” and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will need more information about the request before he’s ready to comment on it, said Don Stewart, McConnell's spokesman.

McConnell, in his own remarks opening the Senate for legislative business on Wednesday, accused Democrats of hypocrisy for objecting to Comey’s firing.

McConnell noted that many Democrats were furious with Comey for his handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Some Democrats had previously called for Comey’s resignation after the FBI chief’s public remarks about the Clinton probe, saying his move was at least partly responsible for Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential race.

Comey was removed “for many of the reasons (Democrats) consistently complained about,” McConnell said.

But Schumer and other Democrats expressed deep skepticism about the Trump administration’s statements that Comey was fired for his controversial handling of the Clinton investigation.. They point to Comey's ongoing probe into Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the outcome.

""At a minimum, the decision to fire Comey raises questions about the appropriateness and timing of firing the person in charge of an investigation that could — I won’t say would, but could — implicate the administration,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Senate Judiciary Committee's highest-ranking Democrat.

Comey's ouster prompted Democrats to slow down Senate business and ramp up their calls for a special prosecutor to be appointed for that investigation — a move that McConnell and other Republicans have dismissed as unnecessary. Schumer said Senate Democrats agree that the Justice Department's highest-ranking career civil servant — not Rosenstein — should be responsible for appointing a special prosecutor because ""serious doubt has been cast on Mr. Rosenstein's impartiality.""

McConnell said opening a new probe would “only serve to impede the current work being done” by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Democrats, hoping to pressure Republicans into supporting the appointment of special prosecutor, forced the postponement of several Senate committee hearings by invoking a rule that allows senators to prevent meetings longer than two hours after the Senate convenes.

""We're trying to get the focus on what we consider to be a historic event that happened last night,"" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats are prepared to take steps to force a vote on legislation to create an outside, independent commission if House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., won't call up the bill for a vote. Democrats are working on similar legislation in the Senate.

""If the president has nothing to hide, then he should welcome the creation of a commission providing an independent investigation to remove all doubt of a coverup,"" Pelosi wrote in a letter Wednesday to Democratic colleagues.

At an afternoon visit at a packaging plant in Ohio, Ryan ignored multiple questions shouted by reporters about Comey’s firing and the Russia investigation. “The people in the press, they’re here because they want to hear me talk about tax reform,” he joked at the start of a roundtable discussion with business owners. “I’ll be making statements later about the questions that they all have.”

Comey had been scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence panel on Thursday, but acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will now appear in his place, according to Schumer.

Democrats said Comey should still appear so he can answer questions about the status of the FBI’s probe and its potential connection to his dismissal.

“It’s extremely important that Mr. Comey come to an open hearing in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence as quickly as possible and testify as to the status of the U.S-Russian investigation at the time of his firing,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the panel.

Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., reiterated his concerns about Trump’s decision to fire Comey and said it would complicate but not stop the Senate investigation.

“The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn’t make sense to me,” Burr said of Comey’s ouster.

Vice President Pence, during a visit to the Capitol on Wednesday, defended Comey’s firing. “Right decision, right time,” Pence said as he walked past reporters outside the Senate chamber.

Even as McConnell defended Trump’s decision, several other Senate Republicans raised pointed questions about Comey’s firing.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the timing of the FBI chief’s ouster was “serious cause for concern.” And Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said the administration needed to provide more details about its reasons for the move.

“Given the timing and circumstances of the decision, I believe the White House should provide a fuller explanation regarding the president’s rationale,” Portman said. “The American people must have faith in a strong, independent FBI. I’m concerned about eroding trust in this premier law enforcement agency.”

Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it is “incumbent” upon the White House to pick a new FBI chief who can win bipartisan support.

“It has to be someone who people on both sides of the aisle will have a lot of faith in,” Corker said. “The ball’s in their court right now … to bring forth someone who all quarters will say is the right person at this particular time in our history.”

16,What would it take to get you off your sofa and into a movie theater?,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Movie fans are starting to see better food, heated recliners and buy one, get one ticket sales! Wochit

(Photo: Eric Curtis, Universal CityWalk)

LOS ANGELES — The recent grand unveiling of Universal Cinema after its multimillion-dollar renovation was a true Tinseltown affair.

After cutting the ribbon for the flagship AMC theater near Universal Studios Hollywood, celebrity guests such as Steven Spielberg and Jordan Peele hit the Director's Lounge, which now provides full bar service and gourmet food (fruit smoothies, anyone?). All 18 auditoriums boast Dolby Atmos surround sound and laser projection, viewed from 1,930 new luxury recliners.

It sounds like Hollywood extravagance, but movie theaters nationwide are touting similar state-of-the-art amenities to attract customers in the face of stiff entertainment competition from streaming services and mobile devices.

Box office reached an all-time high of $11.37 billion in 2016, thanks to rising ticket prices, but attendance is essentially flat: 1.33 billion tickets sold last year, up only slightly from 2015's 1.32 billion, according to comScore.

With admissions up a mere .02% from this time last year, and the crucial summer movie season at hand, the need for outreach is clear.

""Theaters are fine-tuning every option they have to make it more appealing and lure moviegoers. They are trying to make that movie night out an experience people will come back to again and again,"" says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. ""Better seats, food options and drink are a big part of that.""

Here are a few of the cutting-edge efforts to get customers off their couches and into theaters.

The theater seat revolution heats up

The most dominant theater trend is comfort. The standard pull-down theater seat is giving way to plush luxury recliners, often with leg rests, cup holders and the ability to transform into a two-person loveseat.

""If you're going to pay $20 for a ticket, (you) want luxury chairs,"" says Bock. ""Theaters are providing the ultimate experience in comfort that people just can't get at home.""

AMC, the country's largest theater chain, has installed luxury recliners in more than 200 of its 600 theaters, with most of these auditoriums entirely upgraded to the premium chairs, says spokesman Ryan Noonan. He says ""a majority"" of the $420 million AMC spent on theater upgrades in 2016 went into this seating.

The chain is even turning up the heat. Noonan tells USA TODAY that AMC will start incorporating luxury seats with personal heaters in pilot locations this summer, ""with more planned in the next few years.""

There's a year-round need for the seat warmers, says Stephen Simons, founder and CEO of industry leader VIP Cinema Seating. ""Funny enough, even in places like Florida, air-conditioned theaters can get cold,"" he says.

Regal Theaters is incorporating ""buttkickers"" into the king-size seats at a dozen of their RPX premium theaters. They feature built-in woofer speakers that vibrate, bringing the viewer into the action.

In addition to power recliners, the 16 iPic theaters nationwide are rolling out double ""pod"" seating, which allows couples to dine privately on built-in tables (with cabinets to stow shoes and bags). The chain is also bringing out double chaise lounge chairs that allow moviegoers to stretch their feet.

The reclined lounges, placed up front, have turned an previously unpopular seating area into prime real estate — and are free from the dreaded neck cricks that traditionally accompany front-row viewing.

""People want the comfort and to be treated like it's still an experience to go to the theater,"" says Dave Andreadakis, chief strategy officer at Kobie Marketing. ""Theaters have done a wonderful job responding to that need with these luxury seats.""

Theater food gets even fancier

AMC is overhauling its food menu this June, a national rollout that includes trendy chicken-and-waffle sandwiches, a spicy Sriracha dog, gourmet popcorn, stone-fired flatbread pizzas (four cheese, pepperoni, barbecue chicken and buffalo chicken) and gluten-free snacks.

""This is a big sign from the industry leader just how important the expanded menu is to theaters,"" says Daniel Loria, editor for the theater trade publication BoxOffice.

Dine-in locations like the Dallas-based Studio Movie Grill have continued to step up their game, adding seared Ahi tuna and blackened chicken pasta to the popular coconut chicken tenders and seasoned edamame at their 26 locations. iPic theaters feature Hollywood chef Phil Rosenthal's gourmet mac and cheese fries during the month of May, part of a rotating gourmet menu.

Theaters are tailoring the food around films. At Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas, the menus change with the blockbusters. The theaters' 27 national locations are currently serving ""I am Froot"" shakes inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, while the Croque Maurice French bistro sandwich earned its spot among the most popular menu items during the run of Beauty and the Beast.

""These expanded concessions give the opportunity for movie theaters to draw customers and increasingly become a one-stop entertainment option for a night out,"" says Loria.

Adult beverages go upscale

Alcohol sales have become the hot concession, with trade publication The Hollywood Reporter calling booze ""the new popcorn"" — the result of 32 states relaxing restrictions on serving alcohol in theaters over the past two years.

The drinks have gone next-level innovative: The Heisenberg Liquor Infusion Tower blew steam into iPic theaters in January, using liquid nitrogen to flavor exotic cocktails with fresh fruits.

Cinépolis USA has seen up to 5% growth year-over-year with alcohol sales, which are expected to make up 28% of its food and beverage sales in 2017. The group unveiled its Cinépolis Rose wine this summer, an extension of its private wine label (slogan: “Sit back. Relax. Escape”).

Seven full-liquor Cinépolis theaters will serve a color-appropriate Wonder Woman blue martini (with red raspberries) around the film's June 2 release, part of the rise of blockbuster-themed cocktails.

AMC theaters will show off The Gauntlet cocktail for Wonder Woman (vodka, grenadine, house-made lemonade and Blue Curacao) and the Banana Hammock for Baywatch (banana rum, pineapple juice, Sprite).

The tentpoles are tied to specially-brewed beer, too. Flix Brewhouse, the brewery cinema chain based in Round Rock, Texas, is selling a Groot-inspired Flora Colossus beer for Guardians 2, a double IPA with plenty of plant hops.

""Alcohol is a new, increasingly visible dimension in the moviegoing experience,"" says Loria. ""It's appealing to adult moviegoers and highly profitable.""

Virtual reality is a moviegoing reality

Ahead of The Mummy (in theaters June 9), there's the Mummy Zero Gravity Stunt VR Experience, which virtually takes participants along with Tom Cruise on the zero-g flight seen in the movie's audacious plane action sequence. It's been a promotional hit at events like South by Southwest festival and CinemaCon, the national convention for theater owners, and will open to the public at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York starting Memorial Day weekend.

Regal Theaters in 15 cities will host kiosks featuring Alien: Covenant In Utero, a new VR experience that gives a terrifying 360-degree view of the birth of the killer creature from director Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant (May 19).

IMAX opened its first standalone VR Experience Centre in L.A. in January, offering immersive VR experiences built around movie franchises such as John Wick and Star Wars. These IMAX VR centers are headed to three cinema complexes (two in New York, one in L.A.) in 2017, with plans for five internationally in the works.

The tie-in is more powerful when the experience features upcoming releases. IMAX is working on VR experiences around future behemoths such as Justice League (in theaters Nov. 17) and Aquaman (Dec. 21, 2018).

""It's the next big. This is truly immersive,"" says Bock. ""Importantly, it's something that excites millennials. Getting them off their phones (and) into theaters is key moving forward.""

Event nights provide a big lift to attendance

With niche specialties ranging from live theater performances (The Met Opera: Live series), a partnership with TCM Classics for movie revivals, sporting events and anniversary releases (Dirty Dancing's 30th), Fathom Events is quietly growing into a serious player.

Fathom put on 131 unique events in theaters in 2016 (up from 2013's 55), seeing revenue grow from $36.4 million to $55.3 million and attendance rise from 2.1 million to 3.6 million.

Already in 2017, Fathom has hosted 14 million-dollar events — matching 2016's total and making Fathom the country's 12th largest distributor, according to comScore.

""It's like 'Holy cow, these numbers are huge.' They are a growing force to be reckoned with,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, who points out that many events are on weeknights, which are slow evenings in theaters. ""It's a niche market, but a powerful one with limited supply and a lot of demand.""

Online ticket sales are following the audience to mobile devices via apps such as industry leader Fandango (70% of its sales are on mobile devices) and Atom Tickets (which allows users to poll friends on movie selections and pre-purchase snacks at the theater).

Fandango is pushing forward with voice-enabled ticket purchasing on every platform (from Facebook Messenger bots to Amazon's Alexa), executives said Tuesday at San Francisco's SuperBot conference.

The platform even offers ""worry-free"" ticketing, which allows for a full refund on advance tickets right up to showtime.

Apps allow assigned seating, taking the unknowns out of the movie equation. ""People want to sit in the seats they want to sit in,"" says Bock.

Of all the theater amenities, Peele finds this the most alluring.

""I like this,"" says the ""app-oriented"" actor and filmmaker ""It's nice to go and not have to jockey for position, so having the seats in advance is key. That and caramel corn, if I can get it.""

The NBA on Wednesday fined Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas $25,000 for ""directing inappropriate language toward a fan,"" during Game 3 in Washington.

NBA executive vice president of basketball operations Kiki VanDeWeghe made the announcement in a news release.

Things got a little heated last night at the game from the bench as well. All 5'7 (5'9 my ass) of Isaiah Thomas told this disrespectful fan, I will fuck you up and you know that.....lol 😂😂 A post shared by 🏀Sport & Travel Explorist✈️ (@thesportytraveler) on May 5, 2017 at 2:21am PDT

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

The incident was recorded by a fan sitting behind the Celtics’ bench and posted to an Instagram account. It appears that Thomas used profane language and challenged a heckling fan to meet him behind the bench.

The series is tied 2-2 with Game 5 on Wednesday night in Boston.

9,Henry Cejudo injured; fight with Sergio Pettis cancelled at UFC 211 | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — The stacked UFC 211 card has taken a late hit.

Former Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo has been forced out of his fight with Sergio Pettis and the bout has been scrapped from the card on Saturday night in Dallas.

The change was announced via “UFC Tonight” on Wednesday following an initial report from MMAFighting.

With the fight card just a few days away, no replacement will be sought for Pettis, who has been pulled from the show without an opponent.

The middleweight matchup between Krzysztof Jotko and David Branch will be bumped up to the main card from the prelims with the bout pitting Jared Gordon against Michel Quinones now moving to the preliminary card on FX kicking off at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday night.

9,Cardinals reportedly will sign QB Blaine Gabbert to a one-year deal | FOX Sports,"The Arizona Cardinals are adding a little insurance at quarterback, reportedly signing Blaine Gabbert to a one-year deal.

Former 49ers' and Jaguars' QB Blaine Gabbert is signing a one-year deal with the Arizona Cardinals, per source. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) May 10, 2017

Blaine Gabbert is expected to sign a 1-year deal with the #Cardinals tomorrow, source said. — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) May 10, 2017

Gabbert started five games last season with the 49ers, completing 57 percent of his passes for 925 yards with five touchdowns and six interceptions in 2016. The 27-year-old is set to join his third team after being taken with the 10 pick in the 2011 draft by the Jaguars.

The Cardinals gave starter Carson Palmer a one-year extension earlier this offseason after throwing for 4,233 yards with 26 touchdowns and 14 interceptions last year. Gabbert likely will compete with Drew Stanton for the backup role in Arizona.

Gabbert won the starting job at the beginning of last season with the 49ers only to be replaced by Colin Kaepernick, who is still unsigned. Gabbert ended the year third on the 49ers’ depth chart behind Kaepernick and Christian Ponder.",fox-sports

9,Eddie Alvarez explains what it took to get past the loss to Conor McGregor | FOX Sports,"Regret is like a disease that can fester, and former lightweight champion Eddie Alvarez understands that concept better than most.

Last November, Alvarez truly believed he was going to dish out a savage beating to Conor McGregor while defending his lightweight title for the first time in one of the biggest UFC events in history.

Instead, Alvarez suffered arguably the most lopsided loss of his entire career as McGregor knocked him down several times over the course of the fight before finishing him in the second round.

Alvarez suffered from Murphy’s Law that night — the idea that what can go wrong, will go wrong — but seven months later as he approaches his next fight at UFC 211 he makes no excuses for what happened in the fight with McGregor.

“I think I got hit with a punch. Media likes to [ask] what happened or trying to make things a little more difficult than what they are,” Alvarez explained when speaking to FOX Sports. “Fighting’s unique, you can prepare a million times, you can know everything that you’re going to do but you get hit with a shot, you get stupid for a little bit, make some bad decisions, things go bad quickly and that’s what happened on November 5.

“I’m over it. I’ve forgiven myself and I’m excited to get back in there and redeem myself.”

Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

With a new fight just days away, Alvarez would prefer to look forward rather than look back, but he knows the loss to McGregor is going to be a big topic of discussion for him this week in Dallas.

No matter what’s being said, Alvarez knows it can’t be any worse than what he already told himself in the aftermath of that fight and that’s probably what helped him finally move past it all.

“I think there was too much nerves involved and never really got a chance to settle into the fight. I enjoy fights the most once them nerves go away and you settle into the fight. That’s when you can have your fun and be creative and just kind of be yourself. I’m looking forward to doing that this weekend,” Alvarez said.

“I’m my own biggest critic so no matter what was being said in the media or being said by fans, I feel the worst when I disappoint myself. I put my heart and soul into it so when I don’t go out there and it doesn’t manifest in the way I prepared for, I’m heartbroken. I used that energy, I used that disappointment to fuel me in this next upcoming bout.”

Alvarez says he was in “bad shape” in the days following the loss to McGregor but he eventually found a way to even turn that defeat into a positive for the rest of his career.

In a strange way, Alvarez says living through the worst possible situation has prepared him to bring the best out in his fight this weekend with Dustin Poirier.

“Having something like your worst nightmare come true it’s liberating. There’s a freedom in it. I feel free. Now I feel I can step inside this cage and I don’t know if I can feel any worse than I’ve already felt. I feel like I can just be myself,” Alvarez said.

“Just be forgetful. It’s in the past. There isn’t much you can do about it and just focus in on the things that you can control. I’ve done that. I’ve focused on the present moment. I’ve focused on what I can control right now and what I can control on Saturday. I have a good feeling.”",fox-sports

6,Comey firing sends shockwaves through FBI rank-and-file,"Washington (CNN) News of James Comey's firing Tuesday night sent shockwaves through the FBI, where the dismissal of the generally well-liked bureau director immediately impacted the thousands of agents nationwide.

The reaction was not universal. Some in the agency resented the political spotlight Comey had brought on the bureau with his public statements at the center of the Russia and Clinton investigation firestorms.

But many felt loyalty to Comey and appreciated his independence to both sides of the political aisle, especially with critical comments President Donald Trump made about the intelligence community during the campaign and early in his presidency, as well as the former director's efforts to streamline administrative processes.

In the wake of the firing, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe sought to reassure agents Wednesday that the bureau would continue to do its work, according to two officials familiar with the call.

McCabe spoke via secure conference call with top officials in the FBI's field office around the country Wednesday afternoon, according to the officials. He spoke briefly and told them to focus on the FBI's mission. McCabe also met with Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon, where White House officials said the President would discuss FBI morale.

One agent called a CNN reporter in tears Tuesday night to say that FBI morale had never been better under Comey -- and that now it had plummeted. Some said they feel like they've lost a family member.

Despite White House claims that Comey had lost the support of his FBI staff, recent former officials disputed the idea that he had anything but respect.

Recently retired assistant director of the national security branch, Michael Steinbach, who oversaw the Russia probe said the claim that the FBI had a morale problem under Comey is ""inaccurate.""

Comey is ""a man of integrity"" who was ""a strong leader in the organization and entirely respected with the rank and file across the FBI,"" Steinbach said. ""Of course in any situation you have a variety of viewpoints and it's fair to say not everyone agreed with him, but his reputation was that of a respected leader in the organization.""

The move will have consequences with agents, though, another former official said.

""It's pretty damaging, and it's demoralizing, and this move I think further separates what should be everybody kind of on the same team,"" said a former FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to sensitivities of the situation. ""It separates the administration from the intelligence community and law enforcement.""

News of the firing came Tuesday evening, and Comey learned of his firing from television as he met with agents in Los Angeles. As the news flashed on TV screens behind him, he joked about it being a prank, then shook agents' hands as he stepped aside to get the news confirmed.

The public embarrassment only compacted the effect on agents, who almost universally agreed the situation was handled inappropriately.

""Nobody could have imagined that it would have been done this way,"" the former official said. ""Not a good situation.""

FBI agents are trained to separate personal feelings and politics from their work, and former officials that spoke with CNN, who are still in touch with active agents, said they had no doubt that would continue to be the case.

But while the impact may not immediately hit the mission of agents, the overall morale of the agency could continue be affected.

""I think it'll have a big morale impact,"" said another former FBI official. ""As a former agent, we were the people in the trenches for Comey, his troops, and I think it's safe to say that the general consensus is he was liked within the bureau. ... The FBI is supposed to be somewhat impenetrable or somewhat immune to the politics, but I think unfortunately this shows that that's not always the case.""

On Wednesday, the White House said that Comey had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file, claiming that contributed to the decision to fire him.

When pressed by a reporter about praise for Comey from rank and file agents at the daily briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the claim.

""We've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things,"" she said. ""In fact the President will be meeting with acting Director (Andrew) McCabe later today to discuss that very thing, the morale of the FBI, as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI people if necessary and appropriate.""

The White House offered no further explanation of why it was sure Comey had lost agents' confidence despite evidence to the contrary.

Who is brought in now to lead the FBI will be a key indicator of how investigations into sensitive areas like the probe into Russian meddling in the US election will proceed, the first official said.

""If it's somebody who is going to not be as independent and will listen to what Trump and Sessions want, maybe they move resources away from the investigation to the Russian activities,"" the official said. ""There's no ability within the FBI for agents to run a rogue investigation, it's just not possible.""",cnn
3,Suspect in California drink-drive crash 'deported 15 times',"Image copyright FAMILY PICTURE Image caption The boy was travelling with his parents when their car was hit

A man charged in a drink-driving crash that seriously injured a California boy had been deported to Mexico 15 times in as many years, US officials say.

Constantino Banda-Acosta, 38, drove his truck through a stop sign and hit a car carrying a family of three on their way home from a trip to Disneyland.

They said they were one block from home when the collision occurred.

The six-year-old boy suffered brain trauma and is said to be in a serious condition.

The suspect fled but was arrested.

The truck hit the rear passenger door of the car on Saturday night in the San Ysidro district of San Diego, close to the US-Mexico border, said the family.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the suspect had been ""repatriated to Mexico at least 15 times since 2002, most recently in January 2017"".

""[ICE] has lodged a detainer against Mr Banda seeking to take him into custody if and when he is released by local authorities to pursue additional immigration enforcement action and/or criminal prosecution,"" a statement quoted by local broadcaster KGTV added.

He was charged with driving under influence, hit-and-run and driving without a licence.

Another man was also arrested in connection with the crash.

The boy is being treated at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego.

His father told CBS8 broadcaster of his son: ""Right now he's got a lot of swelling.

""He can't open one of his eyes, so he's kind of scared about why he can't see.""",bbc-news
3,Brazil's ex-President Lula questioned over corruption,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Julia Carneiro on how things changed for Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva

The former Brazilian President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has given evidence before the country's top anti-corruption judge.

He was closely questioned for five hours by Judge Sergio Moro.

Lula has rejected allegations that he received an flat as a bribe in a corruption scandal linked to the state oil company, Petrobras.

He says the trial is politically motivated and he has denied any wrongdoing.

The hearing in a courthouse in the southern city of Curitiba was closed to the public but throughout the day thousands of his supporters gathered in a square nearby.

Supporters of the investigation in to the former president gathered elsewhere in Curitiba and in the capital, Brasilia.

If Lula is found guilty he faces a prison sentence. If cleared, he has said he'll run again for the presidency.

This is the first of five charges against him.

Known throughout Brazil simply as Lula, he was Brazil's most popular president during his tenure from 2003 to 2010.

A former steel worker turned union leader, he came to office as the first left-wing leader in Brazil in nearly half a century.

Unable to stand for a third consecutive term, he was succeeded by close ally Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached.

Why is he in court?

Lula is facing five charges related to the Car Wash scandal, the nickname for Brazil's biggest ever corruption probe.

This first case, which is being tackled in court on Wednesday, accuses Lula of taking bribes from a construction company that allegedly renovated a beachfront apartment for him.

He is also accused of money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.

What has gone wrong in Brazil?

How important is this?

Lula is typically loved or hated in Brazil.

Wednesday will be the first time Lula and the powerful judge in charge of the Car Wash case, Sergio Moro, come face to face in court.

Lula says Judge Moro is politically-motivated and believes there is a witch-hunt against him.

Mr Moro is expected to hand down his verdict in 45 to 60 days.

Who is judge Sergio Moro?

Gloves off in Curitiba - By the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Brazil

Magazine covers in Brazil this week depict the face-off in epic style: one shows former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and judge Sergio Moro confronting each other in a boxing ring, raising their gloves and boasting muscular torsos in a montage. Another depicts them fiercely looking each other in the eye in superhero masks, announcing ""the first face-to-face confrontation"".

This gives a taste of the huge expectations surrounding Lula's testimony before Judge Moro.

Image copyright AFP / Getty Images Image caption Judge Sergio Moro has become a very famous figure in Brazil

Like a crowd before a boxing match, Brazilians will be split cheering on each contender.

Thousands of Lula's supporters are to rally in the city of Curitiba in his defence. Backers of the Car Wash operation will follow closely to see who has the upper hand.

But Lula won't be speaking to the judge only. He is the front-runner in next year's presidential elections, and his words will doubtless be measured to convey the right message to voters across the country.

Lula could eventually face prison or lose his political rights. But he could still become the next Brazilian president. What happens in the courtroom will help seal his fate.",bbc-news
6,James Comey doesn't quibble with Trump's right to fire him,"To all:

I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all. I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.

I have said to you before that, in times of turbulence, the American people should see the FBI as a rock of competence, honesty, and independence. What makes leaving the FBI hard is the nature and quality of its people, who together make it that rock for America.

Jeremy Lin can probably sympathize with Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones, who last week said he was taunted with racial slurs in Boston. As an Asian American in the NBA, Lin has heard his share of slurs, too.

But Lin, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, said on the Outside Shot podcast with his teammate Randy Foye, that he heard more taunts while playing his college ball at Harvard than he hears in NBA arenas.

""The NBA crowd is a lot better than the college crowd,"" Lin said. ""The college crowd goes crazy. Some of the stuff they say, it's crazy. It's all students and they're all drunk. They were saying all kinds of stuff. I was at Georgetown and there was one dude courtside and he kept looking at me the whole game, saying 'chicken fried rice' and 'beef lo-mein' and 'beef and broccoli' ... the whole game. Then we went to Yale and they were like 'Hey, can you even see the scoreboard with those eyes?' Or, in Vermont, I remember at one point, I had my hands up with the Vermont player was shooting free throws and the coach was like, 'Hey ref you can't let that Oriental do that.'

""When I got to the NBA, I thought, 'This is going to be way worse', but it's it's way better. Everybody is more under control.""

Lin said that the worst situation during his college days came at Cornell, when he said he was called a derogatory name the entire game. He said it affected him in the first half and that he had one of his worst games. One of his teammates told his coaches what was happening, and Lin had a meeting with assistant coach Kenny Blakeney, who shared a story of his own battle with racism while playing at Duke. Lin said that meeting helped.

""That was a turning point for me in dealing with racism,"" Lin said. ""When you go through that, you have to internalize it and motivate yourself to play better. Whatever you do, you can't play out of character. You can't get your charges and make turnovers and foul out of the game. You have to find a way to turn that negative energy into something positive that motivates you. So that was the last time that I ever let racism affect me in a game. Even in the NBA, there are fans who will say small stuff and it's not a big deal. But that motivates me in a different way.""",usa-today
9,Jessica Penne flagged for potential doping violation following biological passport review | FOX Sports,"UFC strawweight Jessica Penne has been notified of a potential doping violation stemming from an out-of-competition drug test administered on March 20.

USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) reported the findings to the UFC on Wednesday.

Penne’s situation is unique because she was tested on March 20 yet went onto fight on April 22 where she lost a decision to Danielle Taylor at UFC Fight Night in Nashville.

The reason for the delay stems from the original testing done on Penne’s sample showed no traces of any banned substances. However, USADA reviewed Penn’s biological passport and due to certain markers the sample was re-tested and a prohibited substance was detected.

A biological passport is a tool WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) defines as a way “to monitor selected biological variables over time that indirectly reveal the effects of doping rather than attempting to detect the doping substance or method itself”. In other words, the passport monitors an athlete’s levels over time for a potential doping violations that may appear outside of the standard drug testing procedures.

Unfortunately the additional testing wasn’t returned ahead of Penne’s fight on April 22.

Penne is afforded an adjudication process that will be handled by USADA and the anti-doping organization will also work with the Tennessee Athletic Commission on the matter as they were overseeing the event in Nashville.

As of now, Penne has been placed on a provisional suspension as she awaits her adjudication process with USADA.",fox-sports
3,Michael Flynn: Documents sought from ex-Trump advisor over Russia inquiry,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Not all Republicans are happy with the Comey firing

A US Senate panel investigating Russian interference in last year's election has issued a formal demand for documents from President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.

Michael Flynn has failed to voluntarily co-operate with the investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee says.

He was forced to resign in February after failing to disclose the content of his talks with Russian diplomats.

Meanwhile, the fallout continues over the firing of the FBI director.

The White House maintained that James Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

But US media reported that he had recently asked the Justice Department for more resources for his Trump-Russia investigation.

Flynn: Documents demanded

The Senate Intelligence Committee said it issued a subpoena after Mr Flynn rejected its request on 28 April to submit documents relevant to the investigation.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

The rare use of a subpoena by senators makes it clear that the committee is forging ahead with its investigation into the alleged Trump-Russia links, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says.

Flynn: No stranger to controversy

Timeline of events

Comey: Fallout continues

Reaction to Mr Comey's firing continued on Wednesday, with a White House spokeswoman saying that President Trump had been considering sacking the FBI director since he was elected.

But critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russian inquiry.

The White House has rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin over last year's election.

The Senate Intelligence Committee invited Mr Comey to testify next week.

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed"".

""It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,"" he added.

Yet thanks to big games from Avery Bradley (29 points, including 21 in the first half) and Al Horford (19 points, six rebounds, seven assists), the Boston Celtics destroyed the Washington Wizards 123-101 in Game 5 to seize a 3-2 series advantage.

(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)

WASHINGTON — Marc-Andre Fleury’s 29-save shutout sparked the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 2-0 win against the Washington Capitals to earn a spot in the Eastern Conference final.

What it means: The Penguins’ quest to be the first Stanley Cup champion to repeat since the Detroit Red Wings did it in 1997 and 1998 is still alive. They now meet the Ottawa Senators in a best-of-seven series, starting on Saturday in Pittsburgh.

Turning point in Game 7: The opening minutes of the game when the Capitals unleashed unwavering offensive pressure. But Fleury and his defense weathered the storm until the Penguins could rediscover their confidence.

Based on how the Capitals dominated the third period of Game 5, and all of Game 6, they might have carried that momentum throughout Game 7 had they been able to push a puck past Fleury in those opening moments.

""We came out like a house on fire (in the opening two minutes) and it sure would have been nice to pop one,” Washington Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen said.

""I think we got through that first little wave there and got to our game and we were much more on our toes,"" Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. ""I thought we still went at them.. I thought we really played the right way with the lead.""

Penguins’ No. 1 star: Fleury played with considerable gusto and confidence. He made a key save against Alex Ovechkin with the score 1-0. Given his eight wins in this postseason, it’s now hard to remember that Fleury was scheduled to be the Pittsburgh backup in the playoffs until Matt Murray was injured in the warm-up of Game 1. By the way, Murray finally came off the injured list to be Fleury’s backup in Game 7.

Game-winning goal: Bryan Rust buried a shot high into the net from the slot after being set up by a perfect feed from Jake Guentzel. Crosby drew the secondary assist. Last season, en route to the Stanley Cup, the Penguins won a Game 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning by a 2-1 verdict. Rust scored both of Pittsburgh’s goals in that Game 7.

Ovechkin mistake: Ovechkin’s failure to clear the puck out of his zone led to Patric Hornqvist scoring Pittsburgh’s second goal, on a backhander, at 4:14 of the third period. Ovechkin’s playoff agony continues.

Not Braden Holtby’s fault: The Capitals goalie also played a strong game, keeping Washington within striking distance with big saves in the third period.

Streak continues: The Penguins have never lost a Game 7 on the road. They are now 6-0 in franchise history. They are 4-0 against Washington in Game 7s.

Streak broken: Washington winger Justin Williams has been called Mr. Game 7 because he was 7-0 in Game 7s. He is now 7-1.

What it means for the Capitals: They haven’t reached the conference final since 1998, and this group might not be the same next season. T.J. Oshie, Williams, Kevin Shattenkirk and Karl Alzner are among the potential unrestricted free agents. The Capitals are 4-11 in Game 7s in franchise history. They were also eliminated from the playoffs by the Penguins last season.

“It’s just extreme disappointment,” Alzner said. “There are times when you know you are not the best team in the playoffs, or playing the best. But we honestly thought we were the best team in the playoffs and showed flashes of it.”",usa-today

At a time of strain between the White House and the media over coverage of the new administration, reporters raised questions Wednesday as to why a photographer from the Russian media, but not the U.S. press, was apparently allowed into an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Russian officials.

The issue surfaced after photos of the meeting, including Trump shaking hands with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and controversial Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, appeared in the Russian media.

The images were taken by a photographer from TASS, the Russian state-owned new agency.

The issue was further inflamed by the presence of Kislyak, who has been at the center of several controversies involving administration officials, including now fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Russian embassy even tweeted a photograph of Trump smiling broadly as he put his arm around the diplomat while shaking his hand in the Oval Office.

Flynn was fired in February for lying to Vice President Mike Pence by denying that he had discussed the issue of U.S. sanctions with Kislyak. Sessions recused himself from any investigations involving the Trump administration and Russia after acknowledging that he had failed to tell senators during his confirmation hearing that he had met previously with he diplomat.

In addition, Kislyak was brought into the Trump Tower in New York in December out of the sight of reporters for a meeting with Flynn and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior advisor, according to The New York Times.

The photos were taken by TASS photographer Alexander Shcherbak and credited to him by the agency, which included a copyright symbol in photo captions in its own news reports of the meeting. The photos were also distributed by the Associated Press, which credits the Russian Foreign Ministry as the source, and Getty Images, which credits TASS.

After the photos began circulating, members of the White House press corps inquired whether the Russian media had been allowed into the closed meetings.

The White House responded, according to a White House pool report, by saying, ""On background, our official photographer and their official photographer were present, that's it.""

Talking Points Memosays TASS Washington bureau chief, Andrei Sitov, told TPM initially that no one from his Washington bureau was present at the meeting, but later revised his comments.

“Apparently the TASS person was admitted at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry as the official photographer for the Russian side,” Sitov told TPM in a later email. “He is permanently assigned to cover FM Lavrov. His pictures from the meeting are available at the Russian FM’s Flickr. I was not even aware of this.”

Frequently the White House press pool is allowed in the room at the start of an official meetings to take photograph and, if possible, to ask the participants questions.

In addition to the photos, TASS provided comments by Lavrov on the Oval Office meeting with Trump, which had followed bilateral talks between him and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Lavrov told TASS that in the meeting with Trump, ""(we) discussed, first and foremost, our cooperation on the international stage.""

""At present, our dialogue is not as politicized as it used to be during Obama’s presidency,"" Lavrov said. ""The Trump administration, including the president himself and the secretary of state, are people of action who are willing to negotiate.""

MONTPELIER, Vt. — Vermont’s Legislature become the first in the nation Wednesday to approve a recreational marijuana legalization bill.

Vermont's bill, which would legalize small amounts of marijuana possession in 2018 and anticipate the possibility of a taxed and regulated legal marijuana market, was approved in the Vermont House of Representatives on Wednesday afternoon by a vote of 79-66. The state Senate already passed the bill, so it will go directly to GOP Gov. Phil Scott.

Eight states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington — and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana following a voter referendum, but no state yet has legalized marijuana solely through the legislative process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Legalization advocates said bills were pending in other state legislatures.

""I think it reflects that Vermont elected officials are more in touch with our constituents than a lot of elected officials in other states,"" said Vermont Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, a member of the Vermont Progressive Party who has worked on marijuana issues for the majority of his political career. ""I think the public is ahead of us, but elected officials tend to be cautious when it comes to change.""

► April 13: Canada announces legislation to legalize marijuana

Wednesday's vote closed a debate over legalization, particularly in the state House. The divisiveness once prompted Senate President Pro Tempore Tim Ashe, a Democrat from Burlington, Vt., to predict that legalization would take a miracle to pass this year.

Advocates hugged and shared high-fives outside the two chambers after the vote.

“Vermont elected officials are more in touch with our constituents than a lot of elected officials in other states.” Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman, Vermont

Earlier in the day, the House Judiciary Committee voted 8-3 to support the limited bill, which was pitched as a compromise between the House and Senate approaches on marijuana.

The proposal incorporates H.170, a House-supported bill that would legalize possession of up to one ounce of marijuana, two mature marijuana plants or four immature marijuana plants for adults older than 21. The effective date was pushed to July 1, 2018.

The bill also sets up a nine-member commission to study the best way to regulate marijuana.

""There's no slam dunk of any kind,"" Rep. Barbara Rachelson, a Burlington Democrat, said about the prospect of a legal marijuana market. ""It just is doing work that could be used next year or in subsequent years.""

The proposal would continue to prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana and the use of marijuana in public places. Employers, landlords, schools and prisons could continue to restrict marijuana use.

""The data indicates that our youth are using marijuana more infrequently, and I don't think we should put that in jeopardy,"" said GOP Rep. Scott Beck of St. Johnsbury, Vt., who voted against the bill.

► March 17: World's first marijuana gym is in (where else?) California

Democratic Rep. Susan Buckholz of Hartford, Vt., said declining marijuana use among the state's high school students, measured at 37% in the latest Vermont Youth Risk Behavior Survey, shows that anti-drug education is working.

“We need to make a move to be treating this as a public health issue for those for whom it is a health issue and letting other people use this substance responsibly,” Buckholz said.

If Scott signs the bill, a new commission would be responsible for drafting a system to tax and regulate marijuana and submitting the plan to the Legislature. The end result would need to be a marijuana regulatory system that ""increases public safety and reduces harm to public health.""

""The administration will be at the table, along with the attorney general and others,"" said Democratic Rep. Maxine Grad of Moretown, Vt., chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee. ""With Massachusetts and Maine starting up in 2018, I think we need to continue this conversation.""

Scott repeatedly has expressed concerns about marijuana and highway safety. He has the choice to sign the bill, veto the bill, or allow it to become law without his signature.

The first-term Republican governor declined to say before Wednesday's House vote whether he would veto the legislation.

""I don't believe this is a priority for Vermont,"" Scott said. ""I believe that what we should be doing is trying to find ways to protect those on our highways, deliver a level of impairment that is consistent throughout the Northeast, as well as to address the edibles for our kids before we move forward with legalization. Having said that, I'm going to review the bill as it's passed.""

3,Michael Flynn: Documents sought from ex-Trump adviser over Russia inquiry,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Not all Republicans are happy with the Comey firing

A US Senate panel investigating Russian interference in last year's election has issued a formal demand for documents from President Donald Trump's former national security adviser.

Michael Flynn has failed to voluntarily co-operate with the investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee says.

He was forced to resign in February after failing to disclose the content of his talks with Russian diplomats.

Meanwhile, the fallout continues over the firing of the FBI director.

The White House maintained that James Comey was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

But US media reported that he had recently asked the Justice Department for more resources for his Trump-Russia investigation.

Flynn: Documents demanded

The Senate Intelligence Committee said it issued a subpoena after Mr Flynn rejected its request on 28 April to submit documents relevant to the investigation.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

The rare use of a subpoena by senators makes it clear that the committee is forging ahead with its investigation into the alleged Trump-Russia links, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington says.

Comey fired: Fallout continues

Reaction to Mr Comey's firing continued on Wednesday, with a White House spokeswoman saying that President Trump had been considering sacking the FBI director since he was elected.

But critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russian inquiry.

The White House has rejected calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin over last year's election.

The Senate Intelligence Committee invited Mr Comey to testify next week.

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed"".

""It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,"" he added.

9,"Dana White scraps plans for Georges St-Pierre vs. Michael Bisping, declares Yoel Romero will get next title shot | FOX Sports","Georges St-Pierre may be coming back to the UFC, but it appears he’s no longer going to face Michael Bisping in his return to the Octagon.

After several delays to the proposed matchup between St-Pierre and Bisping, UFC president Dana White has decided to take the fight off the table and instead give the next title shot to No. 1 ranked middleweight contender Yoel Romero.

White’s frustration over the situation stems from St-Pierre just recently releasing a message where he invited Bisping to pick a date for their fight after October when the matchup was originally supposed to take place in July.

White finally said enough is enough and he’s pushing forward with a new fight between Bisping and Romero later this year.

“I made this GSP fight, we did a press conference. The thing was supposed to happen in July. Michael Bisping is going to have to defend his title now. We’re not waiting for GSP,” White told FOX Sports Australia’s “UFC Fight Week”.

“(Yoel) doesn’t need to voice his opinion on why he needs a title shot. He definitely deserves a title shot. He’s next in line, he’s the No.1 ranked guy in the world.”

The shocking turn of events comes on the heels of numerous contenders at middleweight complaining about St-Pierre getting a shot at the title while Bisping would be sitting out for over a year without defending the belt. St-Pierre is returning to the UFC for the first time in nearly four years but has never competed at middleweight during his career.

Romero was declared the No. 1 contender following his stunning knockout win over former champion Chris Weidman last November, but he stepped aside when the UFC decided to matchup Bisping with St-Pierre.

Now it appears the former Olympic silver medalist will get his shot after all and from the sound of things the bout with Bisping will come together sooner rather than later.

“Georges St-Pierre was coming back. Bisping-St-Pierre — they both wanted that fight. We asked Yoel to step aside, he did. It doesn’t look like that fight is gonna happen now. Georges St-Pierre is saying he will not be ready to compete now until November. Who knows if that’s even the case. It could be next year,” White lamented.

“So we’re not waiting for Georges St-Pierre anymore. We’re moving on with the division, and Yoel Romero will get the next shot.”",fox-sports
6,24 hours of craziness in Trump's Washington,"Even by the often bewildering standards of the Trump administration, the 24 hours following the firing of FBI Director James Comey were baffling, surreal and at times impossible to process.

In the confusing hours when up seemed down and down seemed up, the White House appeared to be defending Hillary Clinton, the FBI chief was among the last to know he was gone, and there was a cameo performance by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his ice skates.

It all started with a bolt from nowhere late Tuesday afternoon. President Donald Trump canned Comey. No one had thought it would come to this, since the FBI director was overseeing an investigation into Russian election meddling and alleged collusion by Trump campaign aides with Moscow. But the President, either dismissive or oblivious to the political damage he could suffer, did it anyway.

But it was the reason that Trump pulled the trapdoor under Comey that made it so difficult to believe. The White House cited a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein upbraiding Comey over his handling of the Clinton email saga.

So Trump went from touring the country calling for the former secretary of state to be thrown in jail to using Comey's treatment of her as a reason to oust him. No wonder Democrats said it didn't pass the smell test.

The looming dismissal of Comey was held close to the vest in the White House -- a factor that later complicated efforts to explain it to the press.

And Comey himself was among the last to know. He was talking to FBI recruits when he learned the cruel plot twist that had claimed his job -- in where else but Hollywood, California -- when someone glanced at the TV tuned to cable news that was at that moment breaking the news of his firing. Comey thought it was a joke sources said, but he called his office to find out the truth.

Back in Washington, things got stranger still. Amazingly for someone who made his name on reality television telling people ""You're fired!"" to their faces, the President is a bit squeamish about swinging the ax in person. So he sent a top aide to deliver Comey's pink slip, presented in a manila folder to the FBI headquarters a few blocks from the White House.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook captured the Washington mood, tweeting: ""Twilight zone.""

CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin was incredulous. ""This is not normal,"" he said.

A little later on, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey laid claim to the ""first person to use the Nixon metaphor"" award.

Ironically enough, just about the only people whose hair wasn't on fire were in the press office of the White House. There was a news volcano erupting in Washington, but press aide Lindsey Waters said there will be no further comment Tuesday night.

Meanwhile, in Yorba Linda, California, resentment was brewing. Then, in a epic tweet, the Nixon Library staff sprang to their namesake's defense: ""FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian.""

While the 37th president's honor was being restored, it was dawning on the White House -- several hours later than for everyone else in Washington -- that there was a problem. One source amazingly told CNN's Dana Bash that the press shop didn't believe that firing Comey would cause such a backlash. After all, Democrats were as mad at him as Republicans, weren't they?

Up on Capitol Hill, lawmakers were forced to make quick calculations about how to respond to Trump's stunning gambit before they were mobbed by prowling reporters.

Washington was so shook up that even pals like Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain weren't on the same page. Graham backed the firing; McCain was troubled by what transpired.

It was all hands to the pumps on the North lawn of the White House. Trump aides fanned out to spin the press. Kellyanne Conway made it on air on CNN with Anderson Cooper, who registered disbelief when she managed to squeeze in a plug for her boss's election triumph in Michigan. ""Late Late Show"" host James Corden later tweeted at the disbelieving newsman: ""Best. EyeRoll. Ever.""

Then, it was time for Comey to come home.

But to do so, the towering and now former, law enforcement supremo had to get to the airport. The sight of his SUV making its way down a California highway with a chasing helicopter beaming live pictures to cable TV added another layer of headscratching scenery.

Back in Washington, Trump's brain trust was trying to play catch up. In the most bizarre of circumstances, White House spokesman Sean Spicer conducted one the most unorthodox gaggles of his career, in the dark at night, dwarfed by a large shrub at the side of the White House North lawn.

For a while, there was time to sleep.

But at 6:27 am ET, there came a Twitter wake-up call. ""When things calm down, they will be thanking me!"" Trump wrote on his favorite social media platform.

But things weren't calming down. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was in town for the best show on Earth, and had some fun over Comey's plight at America's expense. ""Was he fired? You're kidding!"" he deadpanned at the tail end of a photo-op at the State Department.

Down Pennsylvania Avenue, someone was missing from his post. Was it a case of man overboard? No, Spicer hadn't jumped ship, though he could be forgiven from absconding from the press grilling that awaited. He was just doing naval reserve duties at the Pentagon. But his curious timing quickly fanned rumors about whether he was next in line for a Trump takedown.

Before long, there was even more love for the Trump administration from Russia.

In the most surreal moment yet, the Russian embassy tweeted a photo of its ambassador -- and reputed master spy -- Sergey Kislyak, in a grip and grin with the President, who by now had already hosted Lavrov in the Oval Office. Kislyak's interactions with top Trump world associates -- including the attorney general and Trump's own son-in-law before they landed their administration jobs -- have spawned a steady stream of questions now being examined by multiple congressional committees. So the President's appearance with him seemed to either be a case of defiance towards the Beltway crowd, or a misreading of the political damage he risked.

It turned out to be a day for curious photo ops.

Who should be next for the Oval Office treatment but Nixon's former secretary of state Henry Kissinger? The nonagenarian foreign policy expert was pictured seated side-by-side with Trump -- in practically the same spot where he counseled his own scandal tainted boss as the Watergate crisis raged over 40 years ago.

With Spicer away, his deputy Sarah Huckabee Sanders was pressganged into service. Perhaps seeking to stave off the interrogation as long as possible she wished her daughter Scarlett a happy birthday before wading into the fray.

While chaos reined in Washington, there was one more jab from Moscow.

CBS News managed to catch up with Russian President Vladimir Putin at his ice hockey game. ""We have nothing to do with"" the Comey drama, the Russian president confided. But his smile thickened the mystery.

By the end of the day, Washington was just trying to catch a breath, but not before McCain had adjudged the Comey-gate affair as worthy of a spot on the long list of Washington scandals. ""There's more shoes to drop,"" he warned ominously.

But the day had one more touch of farce to come. It emerged that that actor, singer and wrestler known as ""The Rock"" was giving thought to running for president.

""I think that it's a real possibility,"" he told GQ, but almost no one noticed because the prospect of President The Rock was only about the 25th most surreal political thing that had happened of the previous 24 hours.",cnn

WASHINGTON — The disappointment etched into Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin’s face looked as if it could leave scars.

After another unexpected playoff exit by the Capitals, Ovechkin’s line read: no points, minus-2 and a major defensive mistake on Pittsburgh’s second goal in a 2-0 loss to the Penguins.

“I don’t think our urgency was there,” Ovechkin said.

Ovechkin has been with the Capitals since 2005 and he’s never been beyond the second round of the playoffs

He had two goals and three assists in the first six games, but he played arguably his worst game of the series in Game 7.

“Obviously, (the team had) plenty chances to score … make a couple mistakes and it cost us,” Ovechkin said.

His failure to clear the puck out of his zone led directly to a goal by Patric Hornqvist that gave the Penguins a 2-0 lead

MORE:

Ovechkin was minus-5 in the series, and never had a plus game. Washington coach Barry Trotz played Ovechkin 18:22 in Game 7. Six other Washington forwards played more than him.

Trotz said Ovechkin's playing time was close to everyone else's minutes. ""He doesn't kill penalties. That's why. Then you have pop-up lines and what have you. Most of our top guys were in that 18-20 range.""

Ovechkin had been moved to the third line with the idea of getting more production from the bottom six forwards.

""We're trying,"" Ovechkin said. ""We try to do our best.""

Added Washington winger T.J. Oshie: “I think (Ovechkin) had a great postseason. I think last year he had a phenomenal postseason as well. Teams win this time of year. I think Ovi did a great job leading us and I think he did a good job of scoring us goals and bringing us offense, bringing us those big hits. You need all 20 guys to win at this time of year and when guys aren’t playing great the other guys got to pick him up. Someone’s got to carry the torch and tonight we didn’t have that.""",usa-today

Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey is interviewed as the Rockets announce D'Antoni as their new head coach on June 1, 2016 at (Photo: Bill Baptist, NBAE/Getty Images)

HOUSTON – When the Houston Rockets take on the San Antonio Spurs in Game 6 of the Western Conference Semifinals on Thursday at the Toyota Center, the man who built their groundbreaking roster will be nowhere to be found.

Daryl Morey, the 44-year-old general manager whose Rockets trail 3-2 in the series, will be watching on television in an undisclosed location in the back.

“I can’t watch in the bowl,” Morey told USA TODAY Sports during a behind-the-scenes visit with the Rockets between Games 2 and 3. “Not for big games, I’m not in the bowl. I can’t do it. I’m a disaster. I would be the worst coach in history, because I’d be screaming and yelling and I’d get 40 techs. I’m usually by myself (in the back).”

The NBA playoffs are a nerve-wracking time for all involved, with legacies on the line and much more in the balance. But it may be worse for front office executives like Morey, if only because they’re rendered so helpless this time of year.

The coaches get to coach. The players have to play. And Morey, who surrounded James Harden with all those shooters and saw it pay off in the form of a surprising 55-win regular season, is left to his own devices. Literally.

“I went to sleep at 4 last night,” Morey said with a self-effacing chuckle. “Some of it is just nervous energy. You’re re-watching the game and trying to figure out what San Antonio (is doing). They’re…arguably the best coached team ever, so I’m always trying to figure out what they’re going to do next, if I can come up with anything. Luckily, we have a great coaching staff (because) I don’t think of (expletive) that they don’t think of.

“Every possession matters in the playoffs, so if there’s something – and one great strength from (Rockets coach) Mike (D’Antoni) is he takes input from everyone, all the way down to the intern. So if there’s a good idea that comes up, he’s going to use it. He’s not going to care where it comes from.”

Latest NBA playoff coverage:

No matter what happens next, this season has been a renaissance for Morey just as it has been for D’Antoni and Harden. They all faced scrutiny of some sort as recently as last summer, D’Antoni as a coach whose best days were behind him, Harden as a star with limitations who was roundly blamed for the Rockets’ regression. They went from the Western Conference finals in 2015 to a first-round exit less than a year later. But Morey was the one whose very ethos was being questioned – again.

It’s been that way since 2006, when Rockets owner Les Alexander hired a headhunter to find his next general manager and wound up taking a chance on a 33-year-old from the Boston Celtics who had worked his way into the NBA through a consulting firm. Morey, a Northwestern grad who received his MBA from MIT and has long since become the de facto leader of the NBA’s analytics movement, had spent his previous three years as senior vice president of operations and information with the Boston Celtics.

“When I hired Daryl, everybody said, ‘What are you doing hiring an analytic guy?” the 73-year-old Alexander told USA TODAY Sports while seated in his office. “They all thought I was crazy. (Then-general manager Carroll Dawson) was retiring, and (the headhunter) said, ‘Well I have this young guy from the Celtics. He’s a little different. You should interview him.’ So I interviewed him, and – if you talk to anybody, I really like smart people. I fall in love with smart people. Everybody here is smart. If they’re not smart, they don’t last. So he came in, and he was really smart, and I loved the analytical part. I wanted some edge. Everybody can do the same thing, and I wanted an edge. And so I hired him.”

But in all of Morey’s time in Houston, from the end of the Jeff Van Gundy era through the Rick Adelman years and the Kevin McHale tenure that he brought to an end with his firing early last season, we’ve never seen synergy like this between his front office and the coaching staff. Their shared philosophy of taking only three-pointers and layups, once considered so extreme back when D’Antoni was leaning this way with his Seven-Seconds-or-Less Phoenix Suns, is becoming more of a league-wide norm. And with their core of Harden, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson, Clint Capela, and Lou Williams all under contract at least through next season, there’s surely more to come.

It’s enough to make Alexander grin.

“For the last 20 years, I’ve been saying we should play fast, take threes,” Alexander said. “And when things changed last year (with McHale being fired and J.B. Bickerstaff taking over as interim coach five games in), I badly wanted the coach we have now.

“Everybody in town wanted me to hire a young guy. So I was going to ruin James’ career until the young guy learned how to coach? Anything you do, you’re not as good the first day as you are 10 years later. You can’t be. So I didn’t want a guy to learn with James, I thought that was ridiculous. And I loved the way Mike played. And when we met him, he was a great personality, a great fit. “

A decade after finding Morey, Alexander had found an edge – again.

9,Defending champion Penguins find Stanley Cup form against Capitals in Game 7,"Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury (29) and center Sidney Crosby (87) celebrate after defeating the Washington Capitals 2-0 in Game 7. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)

WASHINGTON — For the last period of Game 5, all of Game 6, and the opening two minutes of Game 7, the Pittsburgh Penguins looked like a group of players that had forgotten how they won the Stanley Cup 11 months ago.

Then in the fourth and fifth minute of Game 7, the memory of how to succeed all came back to them.

“That might be the best game that we’ve played in the playoffs to this point,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said after the Penguins downed the Washington Capitals 2-0 in Game 7. “I thought that was the closest thing to the Penguins’ identity that we’ve seen in the playoffs so far.”

After being dominated by the Capitals for four periods in two losses that tied the best-of-seven series 3-3, the Penguins rediscovered the level of composure and efficiency they commanded in last year’s run to the Stanley Cup.

“Obviously a lot of people counted us out after last game, and I can understand it,” Penguins center Matt Cullen said. “We didn't have a good game and they ran all over us. It was a credit to the character in the room to respond the way we did and come out and throw together a good game.""

It was actually an exceptional game. After surviving the Capitals storming of the castle in the opening minutes, the Penguins did a much better job moving the puck out of their zone.

In the third period, when the Capitals were looking to mount a full charge, the Penguins limited Washington to six shots on goal.

MORE:

While all of this was going on, Marc-Andre Fleury, the goalie that likely will be traded this summer, played brilliantly in net, making 29 saves, for his first shutout of the postseason.

“He’s been our best player the whole playoffs,” said Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist, who scored one of Pittsburgh’s goals.

Cullen said Fleury “stole” multiple games in this series. “And kept us in a lot of others,” Cullen said. “We give him a lot of credit. You can’t ask for a better teammate.”

What makes the Game 7 triumph against Washington more impressive is that the Penguins have been undermined by injuries throughout the postseason.

They are still without No. 1 defenseman Kris Letang, and key puck-moving defenseman Trevor Daley was out for Game 7. In this series, they played one game without Sidney Crosby and 23-goal scorer Conor Sheary.

Fleury is only playing because Matt Murray was injured an hour before the playoffs began. He’s healthy now, but good luck getting the job back from Fleury, who has a .927 save percentage in this postseason.

The Capitals were the No. 1 regular-season team. Now, one of the Penguins’ challenges would be to guard against over-confidence. But it seems like this team is too experienced to do that.

The Penguins know they hadn’t played as impressively as they did last season when they won the Stanley Cup. That’s on their mind as they continue their quest to become the first team in the salary cap era to win back-to-back titles.

As a group we know there's another gear,” Cullen said. “And I think we're all just really happy we get a chance to find it in this next series.""",usa-today
6,The White House's explanation for the firing of James Comey is totally unraveling,"(CNN) The White House just can't get its story straight about why President Trump decided to fire FBI Director James Comey.

When the move was initially announced -- just before 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday night -- the White House pointed to a memo written by deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that made the case that Comey had lost support of the organization with his handling of the investigation into the private email server maintained by Hillary Clinton.

""I cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,"" wrote Rosenstein. ""Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.""

From the jump, it seemed odd that Comey's actions in and around the Clinton email server investigation were the impetus for this move. After all, while Trump had been openly critical of the Director's decision not to bring charges against Clinton, he had also heaped praise on Comey when the investigation was re-opened in late October due to the discovery of another trove of emails.

""It took guts for director Comey to make the move that he made,"" Trump said of Comey's decision at an Oct. 31 rally . ""It took a lot of guts.""

JUST WATCHED Trump: Comey was not doing a good job Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Comey was not doing a good job 02:58

Later, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the real reason for Comey's dismissal was the ""atrocities"" he had committed against the chain of command by openly acknowledging in Congressional testimony last week that he had not told the attorney general -- Loretta Lynch at the time -- what he would say on July 5 when he announced his findings in the Clinton case.

JUST WATCHED White House: Comey had missteps and mistakes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH White House: Comey had missteps and mistakes 00:51

So, which is it? And did Trump, who huddled with Rosenstein on Monday, ask the deputy attorney general to write a memo to justify the firing? Or did Rosenstein do it of his own accord without Trump's knowledge? (There are conflicting reports on that coming out of the White House.) And did Trump turn on Comey relatively recently -- maybe starting with his testimony to Congress on May 3 -- or had he been considering getting rid of Comey from the first day of his presidency as Huckabee Sanders said? (There are conflicting reports on that too.)

What the ever-changing stories trying to explain why Trump did what he did suggest is that no one either knows or wants to talk about the real reason that Trump moved on Comey.

And that reason appears to be, according to scads of reporting in CNN and elsewhere, that Trump was angry at Comey -- for not being enough of a company man, for seemingly undercutting his 2016 victory, for dismissing the ideas that President Obama had surveilled him in the campaign, for continuing to push on the Russia investigation when Trump wanted him to spend more time on the number of leaks coming out of the intelligence agencies.

""Several people familiar with the decision say the President grew increasingly frustrated at Comey after his congressional hearing last Wednesday when he testified that he was 'mildly nauseous' over the idea that he helped sway the election.""

JUST WATCHED Comey: 'Nauseous' over election thoughts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comey: 'Nauseous' over election thoughts 01:57

Trump, we know, spends a lot of time talking about and thinking about his 2016 election victory. And nothing makes him angrier than when he believes someone is trying to either lessen or take credit for what he accomplished in that race. That, in Trump's mind, is the one unforgivable sin.

The firing of an FBI director is always going to be a big deal that merits explanation. That the White House has offered so many -- and they all appear to be either contradictory, half true or misinformed -- makes this an even bigger deal.

Why? Because, as of right now, it appears that the president of the United States fired the director of the FBI because he was angry at him for not doing exactly what Trump wanted him to do. And that should be very concerning. To everyone.",cnn
6,Trump: Combative administration 'could be my fault',"Story highlights ""There's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at,"" he said

The President regularly takes to social media to attack political opponents

(CNN) President Donald Trump acknowledged in a new interview that the combative nature of his administration could be his fault -- though he also cites ""a great meanness"" in society that's to blame.

""It could be my fault,"" Trump told Time magazine when asked directly if he feels his administration has been too combative. ""I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.""

Trump did not further elaborate. His administration has notably had a tense and antagonistic relationship with the news media -- going so far at one point to bar journalists from a White House briefing -- and his tenure in office has often been the subject of massive protests across the nation.

The Trump administration has also been marked by internal squabbling.

Trump grew so frustrated last month with the clear tensions between his chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, that he insisted they work out their differences.

6,White House furious after being trolled with Russia Oval Office photos,"Story highlights The White House did not post photos of the meeting

Washington (CNN) The White House did not anticipate that the Russian government would allow its state news agency to post photographs of an Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russia's ambassador to the US, a White House official said.

Photos of Wednesday's meeting, taken by a Russian state news media photographer one day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey amid questions about possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow, were ultimately posted by Russia's news agency, TASS.

The White House did not post photos of the meeting although an official White House photographer was also in the room, the White House said. The State Department did post photos of Lavrov's meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but that was open to the press.

3,Triple talaq: India top court reviews Islamic instant divorce,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shavista Sheikh: 'These words destroy people's lives'

India's Supreme Court has formally opened hearings into a number of petitions challenging the controversial practice of instant divorce in Islam.

The court said it would examine whether the practice known as ""triple talaq"" was fundamental to the religion.

India is one of a handful of countries in the world where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in minutes by saying the word talaq (divorce) three times.

But activists say the practice is ""discriminatory"".

Many Muslim groups have opposed the court's intervention in their religious matters, although the move has the backing of the current Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The sensitive issue is being heard by a multi-faith bench made up of five judges - a Hindu, a Sikh, a Christian, a Zoroastrian and one Muslim.

The bench has combined several petitions from Muslim women and rights groups into one to examine the issue.

The opposing sides have been given three days each to argue their cases, with the court saying the hearing will end by 19 May.

A judgement is expected to be delivered in the coming weeks.

Analysis: Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi

The Indian government has told the court that triple talaq is unconstitutional, against gender justice and the dignity of women.

Muslim organisations that support the practice say it's an issue of faith and personal law, and the courts have no role in reviewing it.

For years now, Muslim women in India have been demanding a ban on a practice they view as reprehensible.

Campaigners say over the years, thousands of women, especially those from poor families, have been discarded by their husbands, many have been rendered destitute with nowhere to go and many have been forced to return to their parental homes or fend for themselves.

Muslims are India's largest minority community with a population of 155 million and their marriages and divorces are governed by the Muslim personal law, ostensibly based on Sharia, or Islamic law.

The law came into force in 1937 and lays out that, in matters of personal dispute, the state shall not interfere.

'Our lives are ruined'

Image caption Shayara Bano has petitioned the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional

Shayara Bano, one of the petitioners challenging the controversial triple talaq, spoke to the BBC last year.

The 35-year-old mother of two was visiting her parents' home in the northern state of Uttarakhand for medical treatment in October 2015 when she received a letter from her husband telling her that he was divorcing her.

Her attempts to reach her husband of 15 years, who lives in the city of Allahabad, have been unsuccessful.

""He's switched off his phone, I have no way of getting in touch with him,"" she told the BBC over phone from her home in the northern state of Uttarakhand. ""I'm worried sick about my children, their lives are getting ruined.""

In February last year, she filed a petition in the Supreme Court, demanding a ban on triple talaq which, she says, allows Muslim men to treat their wives like ""chattels"".

Even though it has been practised for decades, the unilateral instant ""triple talaq"" divorce finds no mention in Sharia or the Koran.

Islamic scholars say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months which allows a couple time for reflection and reconciliation.

Activists say most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but it thrives in India.

In recent years, many Muslim men in India have told their wives they are divorcing them - by letter or telephone, and even by text message.

There have also been instances where Skype, WhatsApp or Facebook have been used for the purpose.",bbc-news
3,White House unaware of deputy lawyer's 'threat to quit over Comey',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption The White House says the decision to sack Mr Comey was based on a memo by Mr Rosenstein.

The White House says it is unaware whether the deputy attorney general threatened to quit after he was blamed for the FBI chief's sacking.

Rod Rosenstein reportedly was on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst to fire James Comey, US media reported.

He detailed Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" in a memo to President Donald Trump, just prior to the firing.

The sacking of Mr Comey has ignited a firestorm of criticism.

Democrats have called for a special prosecutor to take over the probe of alleged links between the Trump election team and Moscow, which Mr Comey was heading.

Mr Rosenstein reportedly made his threat unless the White House conveyed that the decision began with the president, according to US media.

""I'm not aware of his threatening to resign,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.

She maintained that Mr Trump ""very much had been thinking about letting Mr Comey go since 9 November"".

Lawmakers in Washington are reeling after the White House abruptly removed Mr Comey on Tuesday for his handling of the inquiry over Hillary Clinton's emails.

Critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading the Russia inquiry.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year

Senior Democrats have also said they believed Mr Comey had recently asked the justice department for more resources for the FBI Trump-Russia investigation, which they say could have prompted his dismissal.

The White House has rejected the calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin over last year's election.

Acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director, was due to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday on the panel's annual hearing on worldwide threats.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has also invited Mr Comey to testify next week.

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed"".

""I have long believed that a president can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all,"" he wrote.

President Trump defended his actions on Wednesday, saying Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"".

But Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein said she ""understood"" that Mr Comey had asked Mr Rosenstein for more resources for the FBI investigation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump was with Henry Kissinger when he told reporters James Comey was ""not doing a good job"" as FBI chief

Another Democratic Senator, Richard Durbin, told US media be believed the reports to be true, although Justice department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores rejected them as ""totally false"".

Republicans and Democrats vowed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' investigations into the Russia claims would continue.

The Senate Intelligence Committee moved forward by issuing a rare subpoena for documents from Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, after he rejected its request to do so in April.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

6,Fact check: Trump's 'nothing to see here' spin on Comey firing,"James Comey testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, on Capitol Hill. (Photo: Shawn Thew, European Pressphoto Agency)

The Trump administration has offered some “nothing to see here” spin in response to the president’s firing of FBI Director James Comey. But President Trump and White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have twisted some facts to fit that narrative:

Sanders wrongly claimed that former director of national intelligence James Clapper said there was “no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” Clapper said he was not aware of any evidence, but added that he was not privy to the FBI’s ongoing investigation.

Trump misleadingly tweeted that Sen. Chuck Schumer “stated recently” that he had no confidence in Comey. But those comments from Schumer came before the election — not recently.

Trump said that Comey told him “on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.” We don’t know what Comey told Trump, but we do know that Comey said the FBI is investigating “whether there was any coordination between the [Trump] campaign and Russia’s efforts” to influence the election.

It has been quite a start to the week for the Trump administration. On May 8, former acting attorney general Sally Yates told a Senate subcommittee that she provided early warnings to the Trump administration that its national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had provided deceptive information about his conversations with a Russian official. Yates and Clapper talked about how that could have made Flynn, who was later fired, vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.

Then, the following day, the president made the surprise announcement that he had fired the head of the agency that is investigating possible links between Trump campaign associates and Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.

What Clapper Knew, and Didn’t Know

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe program, Sanders said the investigations by the FBI and congressional committees have gone for “almost an entire year,” and that “Clapper and others” have all come to the same conclusion, that there’s “no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

Her comment mirrors Trump’s tweet two days earlier in which the president claimed the former director of national intelligence said “there is ‘no evidence’ of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.”

Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017

That’s not what Clapper said.

Trump’s tweet came in response to an exchange that Clapper had with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on May 8.

Graham asked Clapper about a statement he made in a March 5 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press that “there was no evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials included in an intelligence report that Clapper’s office released on Jan. 6. Here’s what Clapper told host Chuck Todd:

Clapper, March 5: ""We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, 'our,' that’s NSA, FBI and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report."" Todd: ""I understand that. But does it exist?"" Clapper: ""Not to my knowledge.""

Graham asked if that was still accurate.

“It is,” Clapper said.

But saying that one is not aware of evidence of collusion, or that no evidence of collusion was included in the report, is not the same thing as saying there is no evidence of it.

In the Meet the Press interview, Clapper went on to say “at the time, we had no evidence of such collusion.” But he added, “This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left the government.”

At the May 8 hearing, Clapper said he wasn’t even aware of the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives until March 20. He then explained why he would not have known that when he was the director of national intelligence.

Clapper, May 8: ""When the intelligence community obtains information suggesting that a U.S. person is acting on behalf of a foreign power, the standard procedure is to share that information with the lead investigatory body, which of course is the FBI. The bureau then decides whether to look into that information and handles any ensuing investigation if there is one. Given its sensitivity, even the existence of a counterintelligence investigation’s closely held, including at the highest levels. ""During my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director, both Director Mueller and then subsequently Director Comey, on whether, when and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations. This stems from the unique position of the FBI, which straddles both intelligence and law enforcement. And as a consequence, I was not aware of the counterintelligence investigation Director Comey first referred to during his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence on the 20th of March, and that comports with my public statements.""

To be sure, as part of its investigation into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 presidential race, the FBI is investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. As Clapper referenced, Comey made that perfectly clear in a House intelligence committee hearing on March 20. (More on that later.)

Schumer on Comey

After firing Comey, Trump took to Twitter to chastise Democrats who criticized the move, particularly those — such as Sen. Chuck Schumer — who have criticized Comey in the past.

When the president called Schumer to tell him about the firing, Schumer said he told Trump, “you are making a big mistake.” In a press conference after the phone call, Schumer called the firing troubling and speculated that perhaps the FBI investigation “was getting too close to home for the president.”

A few hours later, Trump fired back with a tweet suggesting Schumer was being hypocritical, given that he “stated recently” that he did not have any confidence in Comey.

Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, ""I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer."" Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017

Actually, Schumer’s quote about Comey was not all that recent.

The White House released a link to an article about Schumer saying — on Nov. 2, 2016 — that he had lost confidence in Comey. That was before the election. Specifically, Schumer was upset that Comey announced the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails just two weeks before the election. Although Schumer criticized Comey, he stopped short of calling for his ouster.

We couldn’t find any more recent quotes in which Schumer spoke directly to Comey’s performance. But on NBC’s Meet the Press on March 5, Schumer provided supportive words for the FBI generally and its ability to conduct its investigation into the Trump campaign “without political interference.”

Schumer, March 5: ""The FBI is the premiere investigative agency here in our government. And I believe that they will do their job and get to the bottom of this without political interference.""

That wasn’t a specific vote of confidence for Comey, but Comey was head of the agency at the time.

More important, Schumer’s comment about lacking confidence in Comey was made more than six months ago, and before the election.

In his press conference on May 9, Schumer said, “The first question [about the firing of Comey] the administration has to answer is, ‘Why now?’ If the administration had objections to the way Director Comey handled the Clinton investigation, they had those objections the minute the president got into office. But they didn’t fire him then. Why did it happen today?”

In his letter firing Comey, Trump said he relied on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions’ deputy, Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein’s memo primarily cites Comey’s “handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton emails.” Specifically, Rosenstein took issue with Comey’s decision to hold a press conference on July 5, 2016, to publicly announce that he would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton and her aides.

After that press conference, Trump blasted Comey and the “crooked” FBI for not prosecuting Clinton, but he frequently quoted the critical comments that Comey made about Clinton at his July 5. 2016, press conference. For example, a Trump campaign document on “Hillary’s Lies” contained five quotes from Comey’s press conference.

After Comey announced he had reopened the investigation two weeks before the election, Trump praised the FBI director. At an Oct. 31 campaign rally, he said Comey had “a lot of guts,” and at an Oct. 29 rally he said he had “respect” for Comey’s decision.

In an April 12 interview on Fox News, Trump was asked why he didn’t fire Comey as soon as he became president. Trump criticized Comey for “saving” Clinton from prosecution, but added, “I have confidence in him. We’ll see what happens. It’s going to be interesting.”

At a May 10 press briefing, Sanders was asked when Trump lost confidence in Comey. She told reporters that “one of the big catalysts” came when Comey testified at a May 3 congressional hearing.

“I think one of the big catalysts that we saw was, last week, on Wednesday, Director Comey made a pretty startling revelation that he had essentially taken a stick of dynamite and thrown it into the Department of Justice by going around the chain of command when he decided to take steps without talking to the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when holding a press conference and telling them that he would not let them know what he was going to say,” she said, “and that is simply not allowed.”

It is not accurate to describe Comey’s unilateral decision to hold a press conference last year as a “startling revelation.” It’s old news.

In fact, Comey said at his July 5, 2016, press conference that he did not coordinate it with the Department of Justice. At the time, the department was headed by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who came under criticism for an impromptu meeting with Bill Clinton a few days earlier on the tarmac of an airport in Arizona.

“I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government,” Comey said at the start of last year’s press conference. “They do not know what I am about to say.”

Comey’s decision to disclose his recommendation without first consulting with the Department of Justice was part of what The New York Timesdescribed as “a day of political high drama.”

The New York Times, July 5, 2016: ""White House officials said Mr. Obama also did not know about Mr. Comey’s plans ahead of time. The F.B.I. director said he did not coordinate the statement with the Justice Department or any other agency. 'They do not know what I am about to say,' he declared.""

Comey on FBI’s Russia Probe

In his dismissal letter to Comey, Trump said that the FBI director told him “on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.”

Trump, May 9: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.""

We asked the White House when these three occasions took place and exactly what Comey told Trump. We asked, too, for an explanation of what Trump means when he said he is “not under investigation.”

We received no response to our questions, but at her press briefing, Sanders declined to answer. “I’m not going to get into the specifics of their conversations, but I can tell you that Director Comey relayed that information to the president,” she said.

It would be important to know exactly what Comey told Trump. It’s not clear to us what Trump meant when he said, “I am not under investigation.” We asked the White House, for example, if Comey told Trump that he was not the subject or target of an investigation, which has specific legal meaning in the U.S. criminal code.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Manual:

A “target” is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant. An officer or employee of an organization which is a target is not automatically considered a target even if such officer’s or employee’s conduct contributed to the commission of the crime by the target organization. The same lack of automatic target status holds true for organizations which employ, or employed, an officer or employee who is a target.

A “subject” of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury’s investigation.

There is no evidence that the president is a target or a subject. But there is an active, ongoing investigation of his campaign, as Comey confirmed at a March 20 hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He declined to say, however, “whose conduct we are examining,” citing the ongoing investigation.

Here’s what Comey said in his opening remarks:

Comey, March 20: ""As you know, our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters, but in unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances. ""I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. ""Because it is an open, ongoing investigation and is classified, I cannot say more about what we are doing and whose conduct we are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step in coordination with the Department of Justice of briefing this Congress’ leaders, including the leaders of this committee, in a classified setting in detail about the investigation, but I can’t go into those details here. I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks. I hope you and the American people can understand. The FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases and about the people we are investigating.""

During questioning, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes asked Comey whether the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign was still in its early stages. Comey characterized the length of the investigation, which at that point was less than a year, as “a fairly short period of time.”

“It’s hard to say because I don’t know how much longer it will take,” Comey said. “But we’ve been doing this — this investigation began in late July, so for counterintelligence investigation that’s a fairly short period of time.”

Again, we don’t know what Comey told the president, but there is still an ongoing investigation. We will update this article if we do get more information from the White House or Comey.

3,More states follow Trump's assault on 'sanctuary cities',"In this May 1, 2017, photo, protesters against the Senate Bill 4 sanctuary cities ban rally outside the Texas Department of Insurance building where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has an office in Austin, Texas. (Photo: Jay Janner, AP)

At least 33 states considered laws this year to crack down on “sanctuary cities” — nearly double the number from 2016 — following President Trump’s moves against communities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas already passed laws this year that punish local governments and public universities that enact policies to protect undocumented immigrants, and other states are trying to follow suit.

Last year 18 states considered such laws, compared with only four in 2015, according to he National Conference of State Legislatures.

The rush comes after Trump's repeated warnings on the campaign trail about the dangers caused by ""sanctuary cities"" and his actions since taking office to cut off their federal funding.

""There's more sanctuary activity at the state and local level because of the president's marshaling confidence,"" said Dale Wilcox, executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which has helped state lawmakers craft their bills. ""This is what the president's executive order on sanctuary jurisdictions was meant to hammer home.""

""Sanctuary city"" is not a legal term, but a general description of more than 300 state and local jurisdictions that have some kind of policy that limits their cooperation with federal immigration efforts. Critics say those policies allow dangerous and violent undocumented immigrants to roam free, threatening the safety of their communities. Supporters say the policies are a legal and moral counter to demands from the Trump administration for local officials to conduct immigration enforcement, a federal responsibility.

The Department of Homeland Security has issued several reports to publicly shame sanctuary cities, and the Justice Department has sent letters to at least nine localities threatening to withhold federal grants if they do not fully comply with federal immigration efforts. Homeland Security suspended its reports because they were filled with errors, and a federal court heavily restricted Justice's funding threats, but state efforts continue.

The flurry of state laws this year is similar to 2010, when Arizona passed a law cracking down on undocumented immigrants and a half-dozen states soon followed with their measures. Many of those Arizona-style laws were struck down in the courts.

""Arizona proved to the rest of the country that (its law) was unconstitutional, bad policy and bad for business,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which advocates on behalf of immigrants. ""Now it seems like other states want to repeat that mistake.""

Read more:

After the 2010 wave of laws, the Justice Department under President Barack Obama sued several states in federal court, resulting in many of the measures being struck down. Wilcox pointed out those states can now move forward without worries the federal government will file a lawsuit.

""They know they won't get attacked by the DOJ (Justice Department), like Arizona or Alabama did under Obama,"" Wilcox said.

Kansas state Rep. John Whitmer, a Republican who filed an anti-sanctuary bill this year, said the increase in state legislation is because of the growing number of states and cities adopting sanctuary policies.

Whitmer said his bill, which he doesn't believe will pass, was a direct response to cities like Lawrence, Kan., that have shown a ""flippant disregard for immigration law"" by embracing sanctuary policies.

""This is our way of saying, 'OK, fine, you do it your way, and we'll see to it that you don't do it here,'"" he said.

Warriors forward Kevin Durant doesn't think much of the NBA combine. (Photo: Chris Nicoll, USA TODAY Sports)

Before Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant was an NBA MVP and one of the league’s top talents, he was a scrawny 6-foot-9 scorer from Texas who received snickers from strength coaches because he couldn’t bench press 185 pounds.

So it should come as no surprise that Durant, speaking to ESPN while the Warriors prep for the Western Conference finals, dismissed the NBA draft combine and its importance altogether.

His advice for lottery picks in a situation similar to his 10 years ago?

“Stay your (expletive) home, work out and get better on your own time,” Durant said regarding the trend of elite players skipping the draft combine. Top-projected picks Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson opted not to do drills in Chicago this year. The combine began on Tuesday and wraps up on Sunday.

""I knew nobody in that draft could guard me one-on-one,"" Durant said. ""I knew that for sure. I knew that. And I knew that you don't need to (bench-press) to lift a basketball up. And I knew that this wasn't football, where that stuff matters. I knew as a basketball player, I had a lot of skill, more skill than anybody in the draft. And I knew that if I worked as hard as I could, then that (expletive) wouldn't matter at the end of the day. It still doesn't matter. I was ranked the last person in camp, drills-wise. I was the worst player, and the first player didn't get drafted. That tells you a lot about the significance of that (expletive).

""Now (players aren't attending), but back then, every player was there ... But now, you're getting players to where they realize their power and they're not doing it, and more power to them ... But back then, I wish I would have known the power I had or I probably wouldn't have done it, either.”

Durant was drafted second overall to the Seattle Supersonics in 2007, but he still holds bitterness about the combine based on his experience. The eight-time All-Star also got low marks in the vertical leap, agility drill and three-quarter-court sprint.

""I remember it like it was yesterday,"" Durant said. ""All the strength coaches were laughing at me and (expletive). They were giggling with each other that I couldn't lift 185 pounds, and I was like, 'All right, keep laughing. Keep laughing.' It was a funny thing, because I was the only one that couldn't lift it and I was struggling to lift it. I was embarrassed at that point, but I'm like, 'Give me a basketball, please. Give me a ball.' ""

Durant, to this day, said he’s not a fan of bench pressing.

""I haven't tried. I know I can lift 185, though, now, but I don't bench-press,"" Durant said.",usa-today
6,Trump to appoint 'voter fraud' commission as controversy over FBI firing continues,"President Trump (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)

WASHINGTON – President Trump is expected to appoint a commission on Thursday to study his unproven allegations of voter fraud in last year's presidential election, as he continues to grapple with the fallout from his abrupt and controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey.

Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will be chairman and vice-chairman of the commission, which is expected to be composed largely of state and local election officials from both parties, officials said

""The Commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people's confidence in the integrity of Federal elections – including improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting, and voting suppression,"" the White House said in a statement.

Trump, who lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 2.9 million votes, has claimed that last year's election included up to 3 to 5 million fraudulent voters – but there is no evidence to back this assertion.

Trump plans to sign an executive order creating the commission as Democrats and other critics accuse him of firing Comey to obstruct an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians who tried to influence last year's election.

The president is planning a visit to the FBI headquarters in the coming days to calm the waters, administration officials said. But the unexpected announcement of the new commission – which was not on Trump's public schedule for the day – might be seen as a way to distract from the firestorm unleashed by the Comey firing earlier this week.

Meanwhile, federal and state election officials from both parties have disputed Trump's claims of massive voter fraud. They say there have been few, if any, incidents of people voting when they were not registered – or voting by people who were not American citizens.

""Every election is going to have issues, but I don’t think that three to five million people voting illegally was one of those issues,"" said Thomas Hicks, chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission said in January in USA TODAY.

Election officials have said they worry Trump’s claims could shake the faith of voters, particularly at a time when the FBI and Congress are investigating whether Russia interfered in last year’s presidential election.

For his part, Trump has stood by his claim.

""We'll see after the committee,"" Trump told Time magazine in March.

Trump had originally been expected to sign the executive order creating the voter commission in late January, but it has been consistently been put off.

Already, voting rights advocates are blasting Thursday's expected order.

“In no uncertain terms we condemn the launch of this so-called Presidential Commission on Election Integrity,’’ Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement. “President Trump is trying to create a distraction from actual threats to our democracy, such as ongoing voter suppression and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.’’

Voting rights advocates say the administration should focus on making access to the polls easier instead of unfounded claims of voter fraud. They argue some lawmakers are using the claim to ramp up more restrictive election laws.

States, mostly controlled by Republican legislatures, have adopted more election laws, including voter ID, in recent years. Supporters say they help protect against voter fraud.

Trump's order get support from some Republican lawmakers, who have welcomed a federal investigation into allegations of voter fraud.

“Safeguarding our democracy requires fair and accurate elections,” Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., chairman of the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections, said earlier this year.

9,Joe Maddon has a very unusual explanation for the Cubs' slow start | FOX Sports,"The World Series champion Chicago Cubs are sitting at 17-17 heading into this weekend’s series against the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals. And manager Joe Maddon has an interesting theory behind the slow start.

“I sense sleep deprivation more than anything,” he told reporters Tuesday, via the Chicago Sun-Times. “I think right from the beginning of the year our schedule’s been kind of awkward. Nobody’s really had a chance to settle in.

“I don’t think anybody’s taking anything for granted. On the flip side of that, I’ve always said I love the word ‘expectations,’ and I do. But understand it’s going to be a different path this year. It is. It just has to be.”

Supporting Maddon’s case is that the Cubs have played three Sunday night games already this season, including this past Sunday’s game that went 18 innings.

Fatigue? World Series hangover? Rotation woes? Subpar defense? Whatever the case, it’s worth noting that the Cubs were 26-8 after 34 games last season.

Perhaps they just need to get back home and in their own beds. And they will: After leaving St. Louis, the Cubs will begin a 10-game homestand at Wrigley Field, where they are just 7-9 so far this season.

Philly.com cited NFL sources that said Graham, a second-team All-Pro last season with 5.5 sacks, has stopped attending workouts and is expected to skip OTAs and possibly a mandatory June minicamp if the Eagles don’t renegotiate his contract. CBSSports.com had a different take.

Reports of Brandon Graham contract dispute are unsubstantiated. Am told he's with his family in Detroit and eager for the season to start — Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) May 10, 2017

“This media-on-media crime, I just like being a bystander to it. It’s kind of fun to watch,” Roseman told PFT Live. “I may have a rooting interest in who I’m rooting for.”

Roseman did not, though, put to rest the notion that the 29-year-old Graham may be dissatisfied with a four-year $26 million contract that will pay him $6.5 million in each of its last two seasons.

“That’s a better question for him. I don’t talk about contracts of our players.

3,"In India, instant Islamic divorces — known as 'triple talaq' — face a supreme court challenge","Muslim women in India are challenging a form of instant divorce known as ""triple talaq."" (Photo: Farooq Khan, EPA)

Imagine if getting a divorce only took having to mumble (or email or text) three words to your wife and the whole thing would be over.

Now the practice, which is banned in much of the Islamic world, faces a test in India — home to the world’s third-largest group of Muslims and one of the last places it is permitted — as the nation’s supreme court considers a case seeking to end the custom.

In “triple talaq,” a man only has to say or write the word “talaq” (divorce) to his wife three times, and the marriage is considered to be over.

There have even been instances where Skype, WhatsApp or Facebook have been used for the purpose.

According to the BBC, the case is being heard by a bench of five judges — a Hindu, a Sikh, a Christian, a Zoroastrian and a Muslim. The suit, which is supported by the government of reformist Prime Minister Narenda Modi, is the result of several petitions by rights groups and Muslim women.

Meanwhile, Muslims who support the practice cite the separation of government and religion, the BBC reported, and that the courts have no role in reviewing it.

Also at issue is the plight of the divorced women in a country with almost no safety nets, who either end up back with their parents or facing extreme poverty. According to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, a woman divorced under India’s secular laws is entitled to a third of her ex-husband’s salary while she most often receives nothing following triple talaq.

Mother-of-two Shayara Bano, 35, one of the petitioners challenging the ritual, told the BBC that she was visiting her parents in her home state in October 2015 when she received a letter from her husband telling her that he was divorcing her and cutting off communication.

""He's switched off his phone, I have no way of getting in touch with him,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm worried sick about my children, their lives are getting ruined.""

A women’s rights activist, Zakia Soman, told the Guardian that triple talaq is “a totally unilateral” and one-sided. “The wife need not be present,” she added. “She need not even be aware.”



RELATED STORIES



The custom persists in India, the paper reported, in part because the British, who ruled India until 1947, permitted India’s huge number of religious groups to run their faiths separate from government regulations. After independence, much of the Indian legal system became based on colonial-era practices, meaning that Muslims can be governed by the Islamic laws, known as sharia.

Soman, however, says sharia has no references to talaq. “Triple talaq is totally un-Quranic,” she told the Guardian . “The Quran nowhere has any mention of it. A Muslim marriage is a social contract and the right to divorce is given to both husband and wife.

“The Quran insists that if and when divorce happens it has to be just and fair to both parties,” she added.

Testimony in the case is expected to end on May 19 with a decision coming several weeks later.

6,Comey firing puts Trump's most cherished trait on center stage: Loyalty,"Trump fumed last week when FBI Director James Comey told senators that it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think he tipped the balance in the 2016 campaign. A longtime Trump friend told CNN it made the President ""white hot.""

Another source close to the now-former FBI director said Trump fired Comey because he never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty.

That explanation tracks with the businessman-turned-politician's decades in the private sector, where he wrote and spoke repeatedly about the importance of loyalty, casting the trait as something every leader must demand from their employees.

Comey's firing has put that deep seated Trump desire on center stage, bringing to bear how the President's business history -- and management style -- are influencing the day-to-day operations of his White House.

During a question-and-answer session from The Learning Annex Wealth Expo, Trump was asked for the ""key things"" a boss should look for when hiring someone and building a team.

Trump was blunt.

""The thing that's most important to me is loyalty,"" Trump said. ""You can't hire loyalty. I've had people over the years who I swore were loyal to me, and it turned out that they weren't. Then I've had people that I didn't have the same confidence in and turned out to be extremely loyal. So you never really know.""

He added: ""The thing I really look for though, over the longer term, is loyalty.""

Read the books

This answer, along with the book he wrote with Trump in 2009, led Bill Zanker, the president and founder of The Learning Annex, to write: ""Loyalty is important to Trump and is a wonderful trait to have in business.""

Trump and Zanker worked together on ""Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life,"" their 2009 how-to book on business that is chock full of Trump's musing about loyalty.

""I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. I value loyalty very much,"" they wrote.

""I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well,"" they wrote a few pages after. ""I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times.""

Trump also uses the book to slam people who he views as disloyal, including contestants on his NBC show ""The Apprentice,"" former employees and even former Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.

""Bill Clinton is a great guy with courage, Mario Cuomo is a disloyal guy without courage,"" Trump wrote.

Listen to the former employees

Former Trump employees and campaign aides, who requested anonymity to speak bluntly, told CNN that this isn't just mindless writing from the commander in chief. He truly craves loyalty and has for much of his career, they said.

One adviser said that this need is why Trump brought people like Keith Schiller, his longtime bodyguard and adviser, into the White House. Schiller, the adviser said, has many strengths, including his knowledge of Trump's wants and needs. But it is his unflinching loyalty to the president that cemented his role, they said.

Schiller's fidelity to Trump was on full display Tuesday, when the former New York Police Department detective hand-delivered the letter that informed the FBI the President was canning Comey.

Some of Trump's love of loyalty, another former employee said, stems from Trump's lawyer-turned-mentor, Roy Cohn.

Cohn, who first met Trump in 1973, was known for his toughness and ability to spin even the worst news into something that favored his client.

Cohn first represented Trump when the Justice Department accused the young real estate developer and his father, Fred Trump, of housing discrimination in 1973. Cohn came back with a $100 million countersuit and, two years later, the Trumps settled. That episode cemented Trump's relationship with the controversial figure and led Trump to cribbing some of Cohn's philosophies.

""Sometimes I think that next to loyalty, toughness was the most important thing in the world to him,"" Trump wrote of Cohn in his 1997 text ""The Art of the Deal.""

""He was a truly loyal guy -- it was a matter of honor with him,"" Trump wrote. ""And because he was also very smart, he was a great guy to have on your side.""",cnn

Comey was addressing employees in the FBI's Los Angeles field office when a television screen tuned to Fox News flashed a banner saying he had resigned. He had not, and he took it as a joke. But soon thereafter, CNN on another television monitor nearby reported that he had been fired.

Rosenstein also is unhappy about the fact that White House officials have tried to pin the Comey firing on him, using his reputation as cover for how it was done, the sources said.

Vice President Mike Pence and deputy White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday repeatedly cited Rosenstein's memo on Comey recommending the FBI director's removal, leveraging his reputation and bipartisan Senate confirmation vote

WASHINGTON – In his first appearance as acting FBI director, Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel Thursday that the abrupt dismissal of Director James Comey has not impeded the bureau's ongoing inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government.

""Simply put, you cannot not stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,'' McCabe assured the Senate Intelligence Committee. McCabe was appointed to lead the bureau following President Trump's abrupt firing of Comey on Tuesday.

In firing Comey, President Trump said he appreciated the former director's three separate assurances that he was not under FBI investigation.

Yet McCabe declined to respond to a question about whether Comey did indeed assure Trump that he was not a target of bureau's ongoing counterintelligence probe. The acting director said he was not in a position to comment or whether such communications occurred.

Senators appeared concerned about whether the White House might try to interfere with the investigation in Comey's absence.

Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., the panel's top Democrat, asked McCabe if he would promise to alert the panel if the White House seeks to ""quash the (Russia) investigation.""

The acting director replied: ""I absolutely do.""

Warner, meanwhile, called Comey's dismissal a ""shocking development.""

""The timing of Director Comey’s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling... For many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president’s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable.''

The Senate panel, which is conducting a separate congressional inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, announced late Wednesday that it sent a subpoena to Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn for information about his communications with Russian officials that might be relevant to the panel’s inquiry.

Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and vice chairman Warner said that Flynn had declined an earlier request to provide the records voluntarily.

""The committee first requested these documents in an April 28, 2017 letter to... Flynn, but he declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the committee’s request,'' the panel leaders said.

Flynn was fired by President Donald Trump in February, after news reports revealed that the former Army lieutenant general lied to administration officials about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the inauguration.

Flynn and other former Trump advisers Paul Manafort, Carter Page and Roger Stone also are subjects of the FBI inquiry, the Senate Intelligence inquiry and a separate review by the House Intelligence Committee.

While Flynn's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the subpoena, he has previously offered to provide testimony to the FBI and to the congressional panels in exchange for immunity against prosecution. But his request was denied by lawmakers and federal investigators, who say it is too early to consider such an offer.

Earlier this week, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates told a separate Senate panel that she was so troubled that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his December conversations with the Russian ambassador that she warned the White House counsel that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail and could even face criminal charges.

At separate Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, strongly suggested that Comey had indeed recently briefed its members that Trump was not a target of the FBI's inquiry.

Lawmakers are prohibited from revealing the contents of classified briefings, but he urged that the FBI make the status of its investigation public.

""Mr. Comey did brief (ranking committee Democrat) Feinstein and me on who the targets of the various investigations are,'' Grassley said. ""It would not be appropriate for me to reveal those details before the professionals conducting the investigations are ready. I will not answer any questions about who are targets of the ongoing Russia investigations.

""But I will say this: Shortly after Director Comey briefed us, I tweeted that he should be transparent,"" Grassley continued. ""Now Mr. Comey is no longer the FBI director, but the FBI...should confirm to the public whether it is or is not investigating the President. Because it has failed to make this clear, speculation has run rampant.""

6,Poll: Unemployed Americans were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton,"This Sept. 26, 2016 file photo shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. (Photo: David Goldman, AP)

Unemployed Americans were more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election -- but they were almost just as likely not to vote at all, according to a new survey out Wednesday.

Per the survey, released by Express Employment Professionals, 35% of unemployed people voted for Hillary Clinton while 25% voted for Donald Trump. Another 34% said they didn’t vote at all.

Still, they had mixed views on the Trump administration and policy issues.

39% said the administration would have “positive impact” on creating jobs, while 35% said it would have a “negative impact” on jobs

57% were in favor of appealing the Affordable Care Act, while 43% were not

58% said it would be easier to find a job if there was less illegal immigration, and 42% did not

“While Democrats and Republicans seem to be polarized, the views of the unemployed appears to be much more mixed,” Bob Funk of Express Employee Professionals said in a statement. “Despite the political commentary, political opinion is not as black and white—or red and blue—as we are often led to believe.”

The survey was conducted from March 14 to April 6 and surveyed 1,500 adults who were 18 or older and were unemployed but capable of working. People who were retired, choose to stay home or can’t work because of long-term disability weren’t included in the survey.

Mercury, sweet Mercury. Gentle and flighty, Mercury is the most unassuming body in our solar system. This oft-forgotten wallflower is only slightly bigger than the Earth’s moon and, with hardly any atmosphere, resembles our faithful satellite more closely than any planet in our solar system. She’s shy, difficult to spot, and, unlike the other planets, is no frills and all business. Also, she can whip around the sun in a mere 88 days because she refuses to waste time on nonsense and melodramatics.

HOWEVER. She is still a planet and therefore has a penchant for #drama of the most devastating kind. We know this because of how much we get screwed whenever Mercury decides to throw herself into retrograde*. Mercury is that kid on the playground who instigates shit and gets away with it because she’s cute and innocent. Tiny madam, we are onto you.

*When a planet goes into retrograde, it appears that they’re moving in the opposite direction of their natural orbit. (It is, of course, an illusion based on how the planet and Earth are moving in relation to the sun.) While all planets retrograde, astrologically speaking, Mercury’s retrograde motion seems to fuck the most shit up.",buzzfeed

9,Derek Jeter pens a heartfelt thank you to New York ahead of jersey retirement | FOX Sports,"The New York Yankees will retire Derek Jeter’s legendary No. 2 jersey Sunday and enshrine him into Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. But before 55,000 fans say thank you to Jeter, the lifelong Yankee decided to thank them — and the entire city.

Jeter, whose 20th and final season in pinstripes came in 2014, write a touching tribute on The Players’ Tribune. Calling himself a ‘kid who grew up in the Midwest’ and a ‘homebody at heart,’ Jeter thanked New York City for taking him in and helping to make him great.

From his post:

“Thank you, New York, for asking a lot of me. For challenging me. For giving this kid a place to grow up. I wasn’t born a New Yorker — you asked me to earn it. I wasn’t born a Yankee, but you made me into one.

Everyone comes to this city with dreams of being No. 1. You showed me that being No. 2 was more than enough.

Today I’m no longer that kid. I’ve hung up my uniform, and I know this much for a fact: I wouldn’t be the person I am today without you. Because the truth is, no matter where you go in the world, when a place feels like home, as New York does to me, you never really leave.

It will always be with you.”

Jeter finished his career with five World Series rings, a World Series MVP Award, five Gold Gloves and 3,465 hits — just to name a few of his notable achievements. And on Sunday he will get the ultimate honor from the franchise that drafted him sixth overall in 1992.

6,New acting FBI director contradicts White House on Comey,"(CNN) Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe disputed Thursday the White House's assertion that FBI employees had lost faith in James Comey, saying the former FBI chief had ""broad support"" within the agency.

""I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard. I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity,"" McCabe told members of the Senate intelligence committee.

He said Comey enjoyed ""broad support within the FBI and still does to this day."" He added, ""The majority, the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey.""

On Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said that the President ""and the rest of the FBI"" had lost confidence in Comey. She said the White House had heard from ""countless"" members of the FBI to that effect.

McCabe also said there has been no effort to impede the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the election, but vowed to inform a Senate panel if the White House tried to intervene.

McCabe was testifying on Capitol Hill two days after President Donald Trump fired his predecessor amid reports he was infuriated about the bureau's probe into whether his campaign aides colluded with Moscow. McCabe said nothing could prevent the FBI from ""doing the right thing"" but promised to tell the Senate intelligence committee if any attempt was made to thwart the investigation.

Amid reports that Comey had asked for more resources for the Russia investigation, McCabe testified that he believed the bureau had adequate resources to complete the job. He was asked by Republican Sen. Marco Rubio whether the dismissal of Comey had ""in any way impeded, interrupted, stopped or negatively impacted"" the investigation.

""As you know, senator, the work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstance, any decisions, so there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date,"" McCabe told members of the Senate intelligence committee. ""Simply put, sir, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.""

In an earlier question from ranking Democrat Mark Warner, he vowed ""absolutely"" to inform the committee if Trump's White house did take steps to interfere.

The man who stepped into Comey's shoes is getting a public baptism of fire. The acting FBI director is a part of a hearing testifying in place of his former boss, who had been due to appear before his dismissal.

He is seated alongside other top intelligence chiefs for a hearing on global threats to the United States and its allies but is likely to face questions, particularly from Democratic senators, about what he knows about Comey's firing and about the integrity of the bureau's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the last year's election and whether any of Trump's campaign aides may have cooperated with Moscow.

McCabe refuted reports, highlighted by the White House that there was a widespread loss of confidence among the rank and file in Comey's leadership.

""No sir, that is not accurate,"" he told Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich.

Burr, a North Carolina Republican, opened the event by asking the panel's members to focus on the original topic of the hearing -- discussing ""World Wide Threats"" -- a request Warner said would be difficult to accommodate.

""It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today,"" the Virginia senator said in his opening remarks. ""The President's firing of FBI Director Comey Tuesday night was a shocking development. The timing of Director Comey's dismissal to me and to many members of the committee on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling.""

McCabe took part in a private meeting with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, after deputy White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the President would talk to him about morale at the bureau following Comey's departure.

Burr has also expressed concern about Comey's firing.

""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination,"" Burr tweeted.

""His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.""

Alongside McCabe at the witness table on Thursday will be Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Admiral Michael Rogers, who heads the National Security Agency, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Robert Cardillo, who runs the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

British actor Geoffrey Bayldon has died at the age of 93, his agency has confirmed.

He was best known for playing the lead role in TV series Catweazle, and the Crowman in Worzel Gummidge.

The actor's film credits include To Sir With Love and The Pink Panther Strikes Again, as well as big-screen versions of Porridge and Steptoe and Son.

He famously turned down the lead role in Doctor Who twice, but did eventually make an appearance on the show in 1979.

Image caption Bayldon's TV credits include Heartbeat, Casualty and My Family

Bayldon was born in Leeds on 7 January 1924.

After studying at the Hull College of Architecture, he began acting and trained at the Old Vic Theatre School.

He went on to star in a whole host of films and TV shows - including playing Q in 1967's Casino Royale, which was loosely based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel.

But it was his roles in Catweazle, which ran for two years from 1970, and Worzel Gummidge, which ran from 1979-81, that were his most famous.

Bayldon also made appearances in TV series including Z-Cars, The Avengers and The Tomorrow People and, more recently, Heartbeat, Casualty and My Family.

10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar

The NFL has denied Cleveland Browns receiver Josh Gordon’s recent reinstatement petition, but he may apply again this fall, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the league had made no announcement about Gordon, who hasn’t played since the 2014 season while banished under the NFL’s substance-abuse policy.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell conditionally reinstated Gordon, 26, last year and said he’d be eligible to return after serving a four-game suspension to start the season. But Gordon checked into rehab days before the suspension was set to end.

There’s little question about Gordon’s talent when he’s on the field. He had 87 catches for 1,646 yards and nine touchdowns in 2013. But he has played in just five regular-season games since – all late in 2014, when he caught 24 passes for 303 yards.

John Cena has grappled with Dwayne Johnson in the ring before, and now he, too, is wrestling Hollywood for a place in mainstream pop culture.

Cena stars alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a pair of soldiers who get pinned down by an Iraqi sniper in the war movie The Wall (in theaters nationwide Friday). It’s a more serious effort than what the 16-time WWE champion has been doing lately — guesting on The Today Show, hosting the Kids’ Choice Awards — though it falls right into Cena’s mindset as a cross-platform entertainer.

“You have to constantly tell a new and interesting story,” says Cena, 40, who had two scene-stealing comedic turns in 2015 as Amy Schumer’s musclehead boyfriend in Trainwreck and a tattooed drug dealer opposite Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in Sisters. “It's just luck, shaking hands and preparation, and then you have to take a little bit of a risk and you see what happens.”

The flattop-wearing, all-American Cena’s social media game is as rock solid as his biceps (with 43.8 million Facebook likes and 9.5 million Twitter followers), and he gets a huge reaction whenever he returns to the ring. But how does Cena compare to someone like Johnson, the charismatic Fast and Furious franchise star and reigning Sexiest Man Alive?

""The Rock is the gold standard when it comes to a wrestler creating a career out of whole cloth,” says comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Cena, though, “absolutely” has the potential of being a strong box-office draw. “The path he’s taking is really smart: show a funnier side so people can get past his intimidating exterior.”

John Cena (right) had a scene-stealing role opposite Amy Schumer in the comedy 'Trainwreck.' (Photo: Universal Pictures)

Like Johnson, Cena dipped his toes first into action-movie waters in the mid-2000s, with The Marine and 12 Rounds, but “I didn’t like it. Doing the last film, I remember saying, ‘Well, I’m never doing movies again.’ ” He came around in the 2010s with a very different role, playing an imaginary dad in three Fred: The Movie comedies for Nickelodeon. “It was like, ‘Hey, you don’t have to be this tough impenetrable force of an action star. You can be a goofball.’ ”

In addition to Trainwreck and Sisters, embracing his quirkier side has led Cena to voicing a nut-addicted pachyderm in Wonderful Pistachios commercials and the title pacifist bull of the upcoming animated film Ferdinand (in theaters Dec. 15); reprising his role as an intimidating stepfather with Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in Daddy’s Home 2 (Nov. 10); and playing a father worried about his teenage daughter losing her virginity in The Pact, which begins filming soon in Atlanta.

“You become a movie star by finding what you’re great at and just doing that for as long as you can,” says writer Dave Schilling, who covers wrestling for the news site Bleacher Report and film for BirthMoviesDeath.com. Cena’s “look, his haircut, everything about him is very straight man-y. It engenders a lot of humor putting him in weird situations.”

Because Johnson’s popularity is “lightning in a bottle,” it would be difficult for Cena to completely replicate his success, Dergarabedian adds. But, “you get enough John Cena fans following his career, plug him into different movies and he draws a whole new crowd to the multiplex based on his star power.”

3,FBI acting boss Andrew McCabe stands by Russia probe,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Andrew McCabe said the FBI had full faith in James Comey

The FBI investigation into alleged links between Russia and the Donald Trump election team will carry on unimpeded by the sacking of its head, James Comey, his successor has said.

The firing has sparked a storm of criticism but Acting Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate committee it had not affected the work of the FBI.

And he vowed to speak up if there were any political interference in future.

Critics accuse Mr Trump of firing Mr Comey for leading the Russia inquiry.

There are reports the ex-FBI boss had asked for more resources to conduct the probe and Democrats in the US Senate have formally requested details from the Justice Department on any additional funding he requested.

Some Democratic senators say they believed the reports to be true, although a Justice Department spokeswoman rejected them as ""totally false"".

Democrats have also called for a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation.

But the White House maintains Mr Comey was fired because his competence had come into question over the way he handled the case of Democratic Party election candidate Hillary Clinton's emails, and that he had lost the confidence of his staff.

Mr McCabe contradicted this by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee the Mr Comey had the support of the rank and file.

In other developments:

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed""

The president is ""very likely"" to visit the FBI headquarters in the next few days, says the White House

FBI staff speaking to Politico have contradicted White House statements that Mr Comey had lost the faith of the agency

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was reportedly on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst for firing Mr Comey, US media reported.

He detailed Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" in a memo to President Trump, just prior to the firing.

Mr Rosenstein reportedly made his threat unless the White House conveyed that the decision began with the president, according to US media.

""I'm not aware of his threatening to resign,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.

She maintained that Mr Trump ""very much had been thinking about letting Mr Comey go since 9 November"".

Rosenstein's way out - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Rod Rosenstein brought a reputation for even-handedness and probity with him to the job of deputy attorney general. Two weeks later, that reputation is being put to the test.

Such is life in the Trump White House, where every appointee and aide is just one tweet, event or press conference away from the maelstrom.

On Tuesday night, as the administration press shop scrambled to explain the president's surprise decision to sack his FBI director, Trump supporters leaned hard on Mr Rosenstein's credentials to paint the move as a nonpartisan decision based on Mr Comey's overall job performance.

The deputy attorney general reportedly balked at the characterisation that he was the driving force behind Mr Comey's dismissal, however.

Mr Rosenstein's threat to resign is different than actually packing bags, of course, and his fate at this point is still tethered firmly to the president he chose to serve.

There is a way out, though. Due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal on the matter, it's Mr Rosenstein's call whether to appoint a special counsel to head the Justice Department's Russia investigation. It may be the one card he can play to sidestep the growing frenzy that spins around him.

President Trump defended his actions on Wednesday, saying Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"".

Republicans and Democrats vowed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' investigations into the Russia claims would continue.

The Senate Intelligence Committee moved forward by issuing a rare subpoena for documents from Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, after he rejected its request to do so in April.

Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Donald Trump's inauguration in January.

His links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team.

9,Ex-Giants WR Victor Cruz reportedly will visit with Tom Coughlin's Jaguars | FOX Sports,"Then-Giants coach Tom Coughlin took a chance on Victor Cruz back when the wide receiver was an undrafted free agent in 2010. It paid off with two 1,000-yard receiving seasons, touchdown salsa dances and a Super Bowl trophy before injuries took their toll and left Cruz in the position where he’s hoping to get another break from Coughlin, who is now the Jaguars’ president of football operations.

Coughlin seems willing to help, as he’s reportedly bringing Cruz in for a free-agent visit later this month.

Apparently, a little miscommunication here: Victor Cruz's #Jaguars visit is actually May 23-24. He's expected to work out for them, too. https://t.co/4e7gaYFSCX — Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) May 11, 2017

The Jaguars are fairly set at wide receiver with Allen Robinson, Allen Hurns and Marqise Lee, but there may be room for a veteran hand such as Cruz if he can stay healthy. He missed only one game last season but played in just six total the previous two years. He made a name for himself with 82 catches for 1,536 yards in the Giants’ 2011 Super Bowl season before posting 1,092 and 998 receiving yards in the next two years before injuries hit and moved him down the depth chart.

16,Who coined 'prime the pump'? Definitely not Donald Trump,"The expression ""prime the pump"" has been used in economics since the Great Depression.

But President Trump claims he coined it the other day.

He bought it up in an interview with The Economist after he was asked whether his tax reform proposal might increase the federal deficit.

""We have to prime the pump,"" he said, meaning stimulate the economy.

""Have you heard that expression used before?,"" he continued. ""Because I haven't heard it. I mean, I just ... I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It's what you have to do.""

But the term is most often associated with 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes, a giant of the field and a favorite of liberals who favored government spending.

Keynes, generally thought of as the intellectual father of the New Deal, wrote and spoke of the need for government to spend money on projects during times of economic weakness to get the economy moving again.

Trump is also an advocate of spending on public works like highways and airports. But in this case he was advocating tax cuts to spur spending, and thus ""prime the pump"" to greater economic growth.

Related: Trump: I might release tax returns -- when I'm out of office

Merriam-Webster traces the phrase itself to Sir Walter Scott in 1819, though he wasn't talking about economics. The dictionary company, which has made a habit of fact-checking the president, corrected him Thursday.

The phrase 'priming the pump' dates to the early 19th century. — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) May 11, 2017

The economic sense dates to a Wall Street Journal article in 1933, according to Merriam-Webster. President Franklin D. Roosevelt used it in a 1937 speech.

Keynes did not actually use the term ""prime the pump"" or ""pump priming"" in his seminal work, ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money"" in 1936, but the term is widely associated with him nonetheless. Google lists more than 21,000 entries that include both his name and ""prime the pump.""

Related: Donald Trump thinks he invented the phrase 'priming the pump.' That's telling.

""Certainly, Keynes is associated with the idea, but it doesn't mean he used that exact phrase,"" said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster.

For that matter, the phrase didn't first occur to Trump a couple of days ago.

""Sometimes you have to prime the pump,"" he told Time magazine in December, speaking of infrastructure spending and tax cuts. And he used the phrase three times in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in March, even stopping to make sure his interviewer got the drift.

""You know what I mean by 'prime the pump'?"" he said. ""In order to get this going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that'll be going, we're going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that'll happen.""",cnn

6,Will Supreme Court rescue Trump's immigration travel ban?,"Protesters marched in outside the federal appeals court in Richmond Monday during a hearing on President Trump's immigration travel ban. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

WASHINGTON — As President Trump's effort to ban some travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries heads to yet another federal appeals court next week, the federal government's lawyers can't be blamed for looking further ahead — to the Supreme Court.

Nearly all the judges who have heard the administration claim the right to restrict immigration from countries it deems as security risks have said the travel ban discriminates against immigrants based on their religion. As proof, they have cited statements Trump made during the election campaign.

The 4th Circuit and 9th Circuit appeals courts now considering the case are likely to agree, based on their makeup — both have a majority of judges nominated by Democratic presidents. But the Supreme Court may be another story.

Chief Justice John Roberts is a strong proponent of executive authority, particularly in foreign affairs. Justice Samuel Alito has spent his entire career working for the government. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in a 2015 immigration case that a ""legitimate and bona fide"" reason for denying entry to the United States is sufficient. Justice Neil Gorsuch is a stickler for the written text of statutes — and banning Muslims isn't mentioned in Trump's executive order.

""The court is also generally reluctant, and the conservatives more so, to invalidate a facially valid act because it was done for a bad motive,"" says Douglas Laycock, an expert on religious liberty at the University of Virginia Law School. ""I would expect them to be especially reluctant to question a president’s motives on the basis of his campaign statements and the statements of unpaid advisers.""

Trump's chances of winning in court have been improved following an overall rewrite of his first executive order. Now it exempts thousands of foreign nationals who hold valid visas or green cards. It eliminates Iraq from the original list of affected countries, leaving Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It lasts for 90 days, not indefinitely, as had been the case for Syria. It contains no preference for religious minorities, while the original had favored Christians. And it includes a waiver process for those claiming undue hardship.

Still, last Monday's two-hour hearing before 13 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit sounded grim for the administration. And next Monday's oral argument before a three-judge 9th Circuit panel may not go much better. That makes it likely the government will appeal to the Supreme Court.

Protests like this one outside Monday's travel ban hearing in Richmond are likely to be much larger if the case gets to the Supreme Court. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

It's not clear when, or even if, the court would hear the case. If the appeals courts are in agreement, the high court could stay out of it. If four justices vote to hear it — the required number — it likely would await an early fall oral argument. And the longer it takes, the harder it may be for the government to claim any irreparable harm, which hurts its argument that a 90-day hiatus would help.

“The odds for the government are much better before the Supreme Court,"" says Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor with expertise in national security. But he says, ""I don't think it's obvious at all that he wins 5-4.""

Read more:

Vladeck says Justice Clarence Thomas could be a sticking point, though he generally is the most conservative member of the court. He has written in the past that the First Amendment's prohibition on government-established religion is not so much an individual right as it is a constraint on the federal government. If so, he could rule the ban unconstitutional even though it mostly affects foreigners without constitutional rights.

And Kennedy's vote is by no means assured. His 2015 opinion leaves him room to decide that the travel ban's stated aim — protecting against potential terrorism — isn't a ""bona fide"" reason because of Trump's previously stated intention to ban Muslims.

But if the bona fide standard is met, he wrote, ""courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the constitutional interests of citizens."" He added, ""this reasoning has particular force in the area of national security.""

Then there's the matter of Kennedy's potential retirement. Many of his former clerks say he is considering whether to leave the court this year, at age 80, or stay on at least one more year. Most of the judges on Trump's list of potential replacements likely would support the ban, just as many analysts expect Gorsuch to do.

“He is the last jurist that I would expect to even entertain the notion that this is a Muslim ban,"" says Jonathan Turley, a constitutional scholar at George Washington University Law School. ""If the order is not expressly a ban on Muslims, he’s unlikely to treat it that way.”

In the end, Laycock says, ""the ultimate question in this case — which no judge will mention but every judge is thinking about — is whether this president gets the same deference as all other presidents.""

That will depend on how the courts balance Trump's words against his actions. Says Turley: “Few justices relish the idea of venturing into the mind of Donald Trump.”

9,5 reasons the Washington Capitals were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins (again) | FOX Sports,"The stars

Have we seen Alex Ovechkin play his final game in a Capitals uniform? It seems a bit crazy to think about but it's not entirely out of the question.

That's thanks, in large part, to the way that he played in this series. Ovechkin fell out of favor with head coach Barry Trotz and was dropped from the top line to the third line following Game 4 in favor of Andre Burakovsky. Burakovsky played well to start the series and immediately took advantage of his increased role on the first line.

Ovechkin, however, scored just twice in the series and didn't show up like the Capitals needed him to or like you'd expect one of the greatest pure scorers of this generation to.

Ovechkin was especially bad in Game 7, when he was on the ice for both Penguins goals and was partially at fault for both of them.

On the first, Ovechkin was caught puck-watching and didn't backcheck in time to put a body on eventual goal-scorer Bryan Rust following a turnover. On the second, Ovechkin had a failed, lazy zone clear attempt that allowed the Penguins to regain possession and go up 2-0. These two defensive failures clearly didn't sit well with Trotz, who said, ""emotionally,"" he didn't want to comment on Ovi's performance following Game 7. (We'll get to that later.)

T.J. Oshie was another star winger that had a disappointing showing for Washington. He scored just once in the series and flubbed a golden chance that would have tied the game in the series finale.

On the flip side, the Penguins got strong performances from their star forwards. Evgeni Malkin was great, tallying seven points in seven games. Despite missing nearly two full games in the series, Sidney Crosby had seven points as well. Phil Kessel added three goals and five points. But it was emerging youngster Jake Guentzel who topped all Pens players in points, finishing with eight in the series.

The Capitals may have looked better on paper, but it was the Pittsburgh's headliners who were better about getting out there and making a difference on the ice.",fox-sports

6,Hepatitis C infections tripled in five years,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share You’ve likely heard of hepatitis C, a disease intravenous drug users have contracted from using needles unsafely. But hepatitis is much more complex. Time

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say testing for Hepatitis C is so limited. Confirmed cases may be less than a tenth of actual ones. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Injection opioid use among young people was the biggest contributor to a near tripling of new hepatitis C infections between 2010 to 2015, federal data out Thursday show,

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said confirmed hepatitis C cases rose from 850 in 2010 to 2,436 in 2015. The disease has few symptoms and testing is so limited, however, that CDC estimates about 34,000 people had hepatitis C in 2015.

Nearly 20,000 U. S. deaths in 2015 were attributable to hepatitis C,

The hepatitis C virus causes inflammation of the liver. If left untreated, it can cause liver cancer or scarring of the liver. It can lead to liver failure. Acute hepatitis C, which begins within six months of exposure, can move into a long-lasting stage, chronic hepatitis C.

The trend isn't only destroying families, it's devastating state health care budgets. Sky high hepatitis C drug costs have led states to restrict coverage of drugs to treat it. Free needle exchanges, which minimize the sharing of needles that transmit the disease, also face challenges with funding and opposition among those who believe it encourages drug use.

Louisiana health secretary Rebekah Gee is exploring ways to obtain a generic form of a drug to fight hepatitis C to treat the 73,000 people in her state who now have the disease. At current prices, her state's Medicaid program can only afford to treat about 300 patients a year.

""The harm that it will cause to not be able to treat this disease is only going to multiply the longer we wait,"" Gee said Thursday.

The national trend has alarming effects in already-struggling parts of the United States. Last summer, CDC reported that widespread drug abuse led hepatitis C diagnoses in young women to rise nearly 10 times faster in Kentucky than across the country.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share What is hepatitis C? It’s a viral infection that can be fatal, without treatment. And it’s rampant in the Greater Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky area. But treatment costs around $80,000. Terry DeMio

Meanwhile in that state, the proportion of babies born to infected moms surged 124% to one in 63.

Daniel Raymond, policy director for the national Harm Reduction Coalition, said the best way to stop the spread of hepatitis C is through needle exchange programs. That’s because hepatitis C is commonly spread when injection drug users share their needles and other equipment. In addition, people who are pricked with discarded, contaminated needles or emergency responders who are poked can get the disease.

“Needle exchange is our first line of defense against the spread of hepatitis C and HIV among people who inject,” Raymond said. “It’s also our best on-ramp to healthcare and treatment for this population.”

But even Raymond is concerned about the rampant spread of the disease.

“Nobody can say that the warning signs weren’t there,” he said, “but the big question is, can the start-up and set-up of syringe exchange programs outpace the spread of hepatitis C?”

In general, Raymond said he’s seeing greater acceptance of needle exchange in some states, including Kentucky, North Carolina and West Virginia. But, he said, “I think there’s a broader sense of urgency that’s missing.”

The Northern Kentucky Health Department has one syringe access program, at its rural Grant County health clinic site. The effort to provide more exchanges has stalled in the more populated Campbell, Boone and Kenton counties. Hepatitis C rates continue to rise, even since 2014, when Northern Kentucky’s rate beat the nation’s by nearly 20 percentage points.

Dr. Lynne Saddler, district director of the Northern Kentucky Health Department, noted that the region is seeing hepatitis C primarily in young adults, with the biggest age range for infection being 25 to 34.

""Actions to reverse these trends must be intensified. We need to continue to improve access to testing and treatment for hepatitis C,” Saddler said. “We need to educate people about risk factors, and be permitted to offer programs, like syringe exchange, to reduce the transmission of this disease.”

New hepatitis C virus infections are increasing fastest among young people, with the highest overall number of new infections among those 20 to 29 years old.

It's baby boomers who are the hardest hit by the disease, however. About 75% of the 3.5 million Americans already living with hepatitis C were born between 1945 and 1965. The increase young people is also putting their babies at risk.

Hepatitis C treatment not only cures the vast majority of people living with the virus, but also prevents transmission to their partners and children. That presents a strong economic argument for paying the price of current treatments, says former Obama administration health official Jonathan Gruber,

""How can we afford not to save people's lives at $84,000?"" says Gruber, now an economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""If you can’t afford to give a drug that saves their life, what is health care for?""

State Medicaid budgets are already straining to meet rising health costs and additional enrollees, even in states such as Georgia that didn't expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Gee says she been forced to cut most mental health treatment services in the Medicaid program.

""I can’t spent the $760 million (drug makers) Gilead and Merck want to charge me,"" said Gee. ""We just can’t do it.""

Hotel heir Conrad Hilton, younger brother of Paris Hilton, has been released on bail after his arrest on grand theft auto and violating a restraining order, but his strange behavior in court helped send him to a psychiatric hospital.

Hilton, 23, was supposed to be arraigned on Wednesday after he was arrested in the Hollywood Hills on May 6 for allegedly violating an ex-girlfriend's restraining order and stealing her father's Bentley. He had been in the Los Angeles County jail since his arrest.

But when he was brought into court on Wednesday, clad in a jail outfit designed to prevent self-harm, Hilton seemed agitated and disturbed, according to an Associated Press video from the courtroom camera pool in Los Angeles Superior Court.

His attorney, celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro, tried to block the camera's view of his client and the microphone did not pick up everything Hilton said, but reporters in the courtroom heard several outbursts from him, including a homophobic slur, according to TMZ and E! Online. Hilton also winked at the court camera.

Shapiro declined to comment in an email to USA TODAY on Thursday.

The judge is heard telling Hilton his arraignment is postponed until June 29 and he will be released on $90,000 bail to the custody his father, Rick Hilton, who was in the courtroom with his wife, Kathy, and another son, Barron.

But Conrad Hilton was directed to check into a psychiatric clinic as a condition of his release, on the video. If he leaves the clinic before his June 29 court date, he'd be taken back into custody, the judge is heard warning him. TMZ and E! Online reported Hilton was going to The Menninger Clinic in Houston.

When Hilton is asked if he understands what's happening to him, he responded, ""Yes, your honor...I'm sorry for disrespecting this entire courtroom and this state and I didn't have sex with hookers,"" according to the video.

This is the latest incident in the troubled socialite's history of run-ins with the law. In 2015, he agreed to plead guilty to assaulting flight attendants on a July 2014 flight from London to Los Angeles during which authorities say he called other passengers ""peasants"" and threatened to kill crew members. He was sentenced to 750 hours of community services and three years of probation.

Later in 2015, Hilton turned himself into police in Riverside County, Calif., after he allegedly led police on a high-speed chase before crashing near Palm Springs in August 2014. Hilton suffered serious injuries and firefighters had to extract him from his BMW.

Vice President Pence said Thursday that the reign of terror carried out by the Islamic State militant group should be labeled ""genocide"" against Christians.

""I believe that ISIS is guilty of nothing short of genocide against people of the Christian faith, and it is time for the world to call it by name,"" Pence said at a speech to the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians, hosted by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

""In Iraq at the hands of extremists, we have actually seen monasteries demolished, priests and monks beheaded, and the two-millennia-old Christian tradition in Mosul virtually extinguished overnight,"" Pence said. ""In Syria, we see ancient communities burned to the ground, we see believers tortured for confessing Christ and women and children sold into the most terrible form of human slavery.""

Pence said that radical Islamic terror groups also persecute members of other non-Christian faiths and even Muslims who do not share their version of Islam.

But ""the practitioners of terror harbor a special hatred for the followers of Christ, and none more so than the barbarians known as ISIS,"" he said.

""Know today with assurance that President Trump sees these crimes for what they are: vile acts of persecution animated by hatred for the gospel of Christ,"" he said.

""Since the founding of our nation, America has stood for the proposition that the right to believe and the right to act on one's beliefs is the right of all people at all times,"" the vice president said. ""Protecting and promoting religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of the Trump administration.

Trump has been criticized for his willingness to embrace dictators who abuse human rights, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Coptic Christians in Egypt have long been persecuted, and in April, ISIS claimed credit for bombing two Coptic Christian churches in the country.

The Rev. Franklin Graham, who organized the summit to bring attention to Christians persecuted worldwide, shrugged off that criticism in an interview. ""We are a democracy but not all the world is going to be able to embrace democracy. You just have to deal with the leaders who are there and work with them,"" Graham said.

""You want to try to persuade leaders that have a different opinion,"" Graham said. ""You want to try to persuade them to your point of view."" Trump, Graham said, may be uniquely able to pursue that kind of persuasion because of his skills as a communicator and a negotiator.

6,Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein meets Senate intelligence leaders,"Story highlights Rosenstein was involved in the firing earlier this week of FBI Director James Comey

Rosenstein has also expressed frustration at how the White House handled the Comey dismissal

Washington (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with leaders of the Senate intelligence committee on Capitol Hill Thursday.

Rosenstein was involved in the firing earlier this week of FBI Director James Comey, but intelligence Chairman Richard Burr told reporters Comey did not come up in the meeting.

Rosenstein declined to answer shouted questions after the 45-minute meeting of whether he chose to write the memo that the White House has used as justification for firing Comey.

Burr said after their meeting that it was not his call on whether Rosenstein should be removed from overseeing the Russia investigation because of the Comey fiasco.

""We don't have the luxury of choosing who we work with,"" Burr said after their meeting.

6,Trump: I planned to fire Comey regardless of Justice Department recommendation,"President Trump talks to reporters during a meeting with Henry Kissinger in the Oval Office on May 10, 2017. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)

WASHINGTON – President Trump said Thursday he planned to fire FBI Director James Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt.

That contradicts the White House's assertions – and a termination letter Trump sent Comey – that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

In a letter released by the White House, the Justice Department's leadership excoriated Comey's handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, in particular, his unusual decision to hold a press conference in July announcing he would not charge the Democratic candidate – only to later publicly reopen the probe just 11 days before the November election.

Trump and his aides are scrambling to get past the furor over his dismissal of the FBI director who headed up an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election.

Democrats have already decried the timing of Comey's firing as a way to short-circuit the ongoing counterintelligence probe. Yet Trump told NBC that ""there's no good time"" to fire an FBI director.

Trump also repeated his claim that Comey told him – three times – he was not under investigation. Those conversations, he said, took place twice over the phone, and once at a dinner that the president said Comey requested so that he could argue to keep his job.

“I actually asked him,"" Trump said. ""I said, 'If it's possible would you let me know am I under investigation?' (Comey) said, `You are not under investigation.'""

But Andrew McCabe, the acting FBI director, would not confirm those assurances to a Senate hearing earlier on Thursday. McCabe said he was not in a position to comment on whether such communications occurred, but when pressed, added that FBI leaders outlining the scope of ongoing investigations would not be ""standard practice.""

In the interview, Trump went on to attack Comey personally, using terms not usually lobbed at senior law enforcement officials. Trump described Comey as a ""show boat"" and a ""grandstander"" who led the FBI into ""turmoil."" The White House has maintained Comey lost the confidence of the bureau after his handling of the Clinton probe.

McCabe, however, told Congress that Comey enjoyed broad support within the ranks of the FBI before his dismissal.

“The vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,” McCabe told the Senate intelligence committee. Agents' support for the former director continues ""to this day,"" he added.

9,Take a tour of Ford Performance's state-of-the-art Tech Trailer | FOX Sports,"NASCAR is an ever-changing sport, and with a constant look toward the future comes a variety of technological enhancements.

In 2017, Ford Performance has advanced how they communicate as a company with their state-of-the-art Tech Trailer, which serves as the at-track headquarters as a resource and data hub for Blue Oval teams each race weekend.

The Tech Trailer helps Ford teams receive the latest information from practice, qualifying and the race by providing an incredibly faster method of data delivery.

Ford has gone to Victory Lane in the Monster Energy Series on five occasions so far this season, including Ricky Stenhouse Jr.’s first career Cup win at Talladega Superspeedway.

“I would say that technology is here as much as any other form of motorsports, maybe in a different way, but the amount of engineering that goes into these cars, the amount of data, and the amount of analysis that is used grows more and more every day, and it takes a lot to keep up with it and stay ahead,” said Mark Rushbrook, Ford Performance Motorsports Engineering Manager.

Before the Tech Trailer that debuted last October at Dover International Speedway, Travis Geisler, Team Penske’s NASCAR competition director, says that communication was certainly an issue.

“I can tell you before the trailer was there the struggle that we had with networks and sharing information, getting the technology that’s available into the hands of the guys who actually need to apply it and make the car better, was really a battle for us,” Geisler admitted. “This is something that everybody discussed as a priority. Ford stepped up and made the Tech Trailer happen and it’s something that we’re able to realize the gains from every weekend.”

During a recent interview with FOXSports.com, Tony Gibson, crew chief for Kurt Busch and the 2017 Daytona 500-winning No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing team, indicated just how much emphasis Ford Performance puts on them to work together as one manufacturer.

“Ford Performance does a really good job of making us work together and be one big group of racers,” Gibson said. “We’ve never really had that before with other manufacturers, so it’s really nice to have a company like Ford Performance to help guide us and make us feel more friendly to one another.”

As Ford Performance has changed the way teams communicate with each other at the track, take an inside look at the Tech Trailer below.

3,Why India is going bananas over birth control for monkeys,"A rescued rhesus macaque monkey eats ice cream to beat the heat at the Asha Foundation and animal shelter at Hathijan village near, Ahmedabad, India. (Photo: Sam Panthaky, AFP/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI — On a typical afternoon in a posh neighborhood here, a troop of rhesus macaque monkeys climb the wall of an apartment building to the rooftop water tanks with a specific goal.

Swinging like circus performers until one of the water pipes snaps off, the monkeys rush to drink the spraying water.

“It happens quite often,” said homeowner Shakun Chandhok, who called a plumber after a servant used a stick to drive off the monkeys. “They used to jump into the balcony and come into the kitchen and open the fridge, just like any human being does.”

The orange or gray monkeys, which weigh 12 to 17 pounds, have become one of the most dreaded pests in India, biting around 1,000 people a day nationwide and overrunning cities like New Delhi. The monkey problem has become so overwhelming that officials are searching for ways to use birth control on the animals.

In the fruit-growing state of Himachal Pradesh, monkeys have increased more than fivefold in the past decade, according the government. The animals create up to $300 million in crop losses and diverted labor every year, the farmer’s group Kheti Bachao Andolan said.

“Wherever they go, panic spreads,” said primatologist Iqbal Malik, who runs a nonprofit called Vatavaran, which is Hindi for environment. “Residents warn each other to close all doors and windows. Any houses which get raided by monkeys (are left) in shambles — eatables on the floor, crockery broken, taps open, wires cut, plants mauled.”

Himachal Pradesh formed a task force this month to cull the animals, which officials recently declared vermin. In the neighboring state of Uttarakhand, scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India will test an injectable contraceptive that has been used on white-tailed deer and wild horses in the United States.

“What our simulation and modeling indicate is that we need to control reproduction by more than 70% of the adult female population for a very long time, eight to 10 years,” to seriously impact monkey populations, said Qamar Qureshi, a senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute involved with the injectable contraceptives program.

City and state governments have tried numerous methods to control the monkey troubles. Since the monkeys are associated with the Hindu god Hanuman, mass culling has never been attempted. Officials have tried surgical sterilization. They’ve also employed monkey trainers to bring in tame langurs — a larger, more dominant species — to scare off the macaques.

Delhi officials even hired people to impersonate langurs to keep rogue macaques out of parliament. But the impersonators couldn’t keep them out of the building for long.

Himachal Pradesh spent around $1 million to set up eight sterilization centers. Officials pay trappers a bonus of nearly $10 a head for capturing the animals. Over the past 10 years, the state has sterilized more than 125,000 monkeys.

The cost and difficulty of sterilization has prompted persistent calls for trying oral contraceptives, a proposal first suggested in 2013. Qureshi said that plan failed because it's difficult to ensure the female monkeys consume the correct dosage, plus concerns that the drugs might hurt other species.

“Using oral contraceptives is a far-fetched dream at present,” he said. “It’s very difficult to implement in the field. We’re not talking about zoo conditions, where you can feed monkeys in controlled conditions.”

Injections are more practical, and in theory could be administered more quickly, but still present challenges. A single dose lasts only one year, and after that booster shots are necessary. At nearly $100 a dose, that's too costly for widespread use in the United States, let alone in India.

Surgical sterilization is much cheaper, easier to monitor and permanent, said Mewa Singh, a primatologist at the University of Mysore. But catching and releasing the monkeys is also costly.

Adding to the multiplying monkey population in urban centers from New Delhi in the north to Chennai in the south: People feed them at temples and parks, believing them to be holy.

“In South India, we’ve been monitoring the (macaque) population for the past 25 years,” he said. “The population has come down by 66%. But the complaint is the same. There are hundreds of thousands of monkeys, and they’re damaging the crops.”

9,John Wall surprised by Celtics’ fans vulgar chant directed at Kelly Oubre Jr. | FOX Sports,"Washington Wizards forward Kelly Oubre Jr. assumed Celtics fans would let him hear it for his altercation with Kelly Olynyk earlier in the series, but what Boston fans had in store for Oubre was so vulgar that it caught Wizards star John Wall off guard Wednesday night.

Fans at TD Garden initially chanted “We want Oubre!” but the crowd changed its tune later in the game, screaming “[Expletive] you, Oubre!” loud enough that it could be heard on the TNT broadcast.

Wall said after the Celtics’ 123-101 win that the vulgarity took him by surprise.

“We told [Oubre] what to expect from the crowd. We didn’t think it would be those type of words,” Wall told reporters, via ESPN. “But all you can do is go out there and play basketball. We’re his brothers. We stick behind him.”

Oubre was given a one-game suspension after he leveled Olynyk for setting an illegal screen in Game 3. Oubre tried to downplay what he heard from the fans Wednesday.

“Um, I still hear my name ringing in my head because that’s all I heard when I was on the court, but I was just going out there to play,” Oubre told reporters, via The Washington Post.

Oubre finished with 13 points on 5-of-10 shooting in 20 minutes Wednesday night. The Wizards hope to extend the series, which is heading back to Washington with the Celtics up 3-2.",fox-sports
9,"The Capitals and Alex Ovechkin are hapless losers, but don't call them chokers (maybe) | FOX Sports","Alex Ovechkin didn’t trip on his shoelaces. He didn’t whiff on shots or pull a McNabb on the blue line. His Washington Capitals didn’t get embarrassed or booed off the ice (though the former might have been deserved) at the end of Wednesday’s inevitable Game 7 home loss to the perennial Caps-killing Pittsburgh Penguins.

Maybe they did choke under the weight of three decades of postseason failure. Or maybe the story behind the latest and greatest playoff collapse for the NHL’s most underachieving franchise was far less grandiose: shoddy goaltending and how-did-that-miss offensive opportunities, including Ovechkin’s own sweet-spot slap shot that was destined for the back of the net until it somehow got deflected by the shaft of Marc-André Fleury’s stick.

No matter. Reasons and rationality are irrelevant in a time like this. The Caps choked. Ovi isn’t clutch. Blow ’em up.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports

In zero-sum games, that’s the easy and obvious reaction. Forget that with a few different bounces of the puck, the Washington Capitals advance to the Eastern Conference Finals and are favored to win the Stanley Cup. The Ovechkin referendum and talk of blowing up the team become a distant memory. They’ve gotten over the hump and all the misery is behind them.

Except that it’s not and now the franchise and its Hall of Famer player are in crisis, all because they got outscored in the final 32 minutes of its season. Just like that. Less than 24 hours ago, the sky was the limit for the Washington Capitals. Now, the limit has been firmly established as the Eastern Conference Semifinals and it might take a complete teardown to move the line.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports

It’s certainly possible, even plausible, the Caps choked it away like they have so many times before – collapsing under the weight of the ghosts of the Easter Epic, Pittsburgh blowouts and the dozen other bad playoff losses. It’s not like we’d ever know. You can’t blindly assign labels based on results, not when those results can be so arbitrary. Win and the Caps conquered decades of turmoil. Lose and it’s a total collapse. No in between. No room for nuance.

The “choke” or “clutch” idea exists merely as confirmation bias, added after the fact. They lost, so they choked. But did they? Just because the final score read 2-0, we don’t know their muscles were tight or that they overthought every scoring opportunity. Are you sure the pressure affected how they set up the power play or if Braden Holtby’s rough night was due to nerves instead of simply having an ill-timed off night?

What is a choke? Nerves failing you at the biggest moment. What is clutch? Coming through in that moment. Both are nebulous, indefinable concepts that no number can capture or declare. There’s no stat that reveals an athlete’s ability to come through when the situation is the toughest. They’re both feelings that lead to actions. A clutch athlete lives for the pressure situation and revels in the excitement around it. They excel when the only other option is defeat – think Tiger Woods, Tom Brady, David Ortiz and Serena Williams.

Of course, there’s no way to know for sure. Maybe those athlete are puddles of nerves in the big moments and somehow they come through anyway. They’re certainly talented enough to compensate for it. Maybe, but it doubt it. When Tiger hit that putt on No. 18 in the 2008 U.S. Open, NBC’s Dan Hicks shouted “expect anything different?” and no one did. When Brady led the Patriots on a game-winning touchdown on the first drive of overtime in the Super Bowl, it felt predestined. When Serena is down a set and a break and all looks lost, that’s when she seems to play her best.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports

But because being clutch is still subject to the percentages and expected failures in sports, there’s no legitimate way to definitively place such a label on an athlete. Even if Ortiz was the most clutch player in baseball history, he’d still get out half the time in big spots. Brady lost two Super Bowls in the final minutes. Serena has dropped two of her last four Grand Slam finals. And Tiger is showing that clutch can only go so far; without the talent to back it up it’s a worthless trait.

Then there’s the flip side. Those deemed chokers can still succeed too. You can drill a birdie putt on the 18th hole of the Masters. (It’s how Phil Mickelson won his first major.) There are still Super Bowls to win even if your performances in the biggest games aren’t up to your usual standards. (Peyton Manning has two rings.) The Stanley Cup is attainable even if you do your best to give it away (about halfway through Game 7, the Caps and Penguins were tied – it’s not hard to imagine a scenario where one of the Caps shots got past Fleury and today we’re talking about Ovechkin being close to cementing his legacy). You can overcome shaky nerves and fail with steely ones.

None of these things are mutually exclusive. In sports, where series, careers and reputations can hinge on missing a pitch by a half-inch, being slightly out of position on a power-play pass or letting one stray thought creep into your mind when the ball is in the air for a serve, the little things can be the difference between turning the Washington Capitals from a Stanley Cup favorite to a team many agree is in need of a complete demolition in a matter of two-and-a-half hours.

(USA TODAY Sports Images) Amber Searls-USA TODAY Sports

Ovechkin isn’t deserving of all the blame but shouldn’t be absolved of it either. Okay, he averages more points both in elimination games and in the playoffs against the Penguins than he does in the regular season. Great. I can play numbers too. Ovechkin’s teams have a playoff winning percentage that’s vastly worse than their regular-season winning percentage. Here’s another: No player with as many MVP awards has ever failed to win a Stanley Cup. And not only has Ovi failed to hoist the Cup, he hasn’t even come within eight wins of it, as his Caps have never advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. Which one matters more?

So call him what you want. Superstar. Choker. MVP. Disappointment. Victim of circumstance. There’s only one title that matters for Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals: Playoff losers, yet again.",fox-sports
9,Cardinals release former Pro Bowl LB Daryl Washington after his reinstatement | FOX Sports,"Former Pro Bowl linebacker Daryl Washington was reinstated by the league last month, more than three years after he played his last NFL game for the Arizona Cardinals, but the team released him Thursday.

We have released LB Daryl Washington. More info: https://t.co/pv1wdhqP3N pic.twitter.com/MBMq0G1yOI — Arizona Cardinals (@AZCardinals) May 11, 2017

Washington, 30, was suspended multiple times for violating the league’s substance abuse policy and had legal problems, too, serving 10 months of probation in 2014 for assaulting his former girlfriend.

On Monday, the Cardinals met with Washington for the first time since his suspension. At one time, he was one of the most dynamic inside linebackers in the league, racking up nine sacks during his 2012 Pro Bowl season. But Cardinals president and owner Michael Bidwell told SiriusXM’s Mad Dog Sports Radio this week that he wanted to know where he was at off the field.

“This is the first time we’ve dealt with a situation like this. I will speak generally: We need to know that this isn’t going to happen again, that he’s accepted responsibility for what happened and what he had done. … professionally that they’re going to be good to go moving forward and that we’re comfortable having him around.”

Washington said all the right things in his statement after being reinstated, but apparently it wasn’t enough.

“I’m honored and humbled to be back in the National Football League,” the linebacker said in an April statement. “These last three years have been the most difficult of my life without the game I love so much. That said, I’ve used this time to make tremendous strides as a man and have grown into a proud husband, father and contributing member of my community.

“Physically I’m in the best shape of my life and have maintained a strenuous six-day-per-week workout plan for over a year in anticipation of this day and next season. I understand the physical and mental demands that it takes to be an All-Pro linebacker in this league, and I fully intend to play at that level this season.”

9,Demian Maia doesn't have 'any doubt' that a win at UFC 211 should earn him a title shot | FOX Sports,"DALLAS — By all accounts, Demian Maia should already be fighting for the UFC welterweight title.

The veteran submission specialist has won six fights in a row including a lopsided victory over Gunnar Nelson as well as tapping out former interim champion Carlos Condit as well as Matt Brown in recent performances.

Still, Maia hasn’t earned his shot at the gold and instead he’s facing a very tough opponent this weekend at UFC 211 when he takes on Jorge Masvidal in Dallas.

Admittedly, Maia was a little frustrated that he had to fight yet another top ranked welterweight rather than earning his title shot, but he couldn’t deviate his focus or risk Masvidal getting a win over him.

“At first of course [I was disappointed] but after I said OK, let’s fight so I just cleared my mind and that’s the fight,” Maia told FOX Sports on Wednesday. “Like every other fight, it’s the most important fight of my life. Every fight is the most important fight of your life.”

Maia knows that Masvidal offers an interesting opposition with his fast hands, dangerous boxing and quick takedown defense.

Current welterweight champion Tyron Woodley has even commented that Masvidal’s style could present a lot of problems for Maia’s grappling heavy game where he attempts to drag his opponents to the mat before applying his world class Brazilian jiu-jitsu arsenal.

Still, Maia is just as confident now against Masvidal as he’s been in all his recent fights because he knows he doesn’t need much time with any opponent on the ground to show why he’s arguably the most dangerous submission artist in the UFC.

“Every fight of course is different but pretty much he’s a very good striker with takedown defense. At this level, everybody’s like that. Almost every fight that I have fought, they were really good strikers with takedown defense,” Maia said about Masvidal “So I don’t think it’s different but I just feel when you get inside the Octagon, you’re really going to feel your opponent.

“My goal is to [submit him]. My mindset is to do that. Of course, he’s a really tough opponent, very well rounded, very good boxer, but in my mind I want to go in there and do the same as the last fights.”

Maia understands there are no guarantees that a title shot will await him with a win on Saturday night, but he also knows there’s no logic against him challenging for the belt if he gets past Masvidal at UFC 211.

“I don’t have any doubt about that,” Maia said about getting his title shot with a win over Masvidal.

US President Donald Trump has insisted he is not under investigation, as he dismissed the FBI director he fired as a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"".

Mr Trump also revealed to NBC News it was his decision to sack James Comey.

Mr Comey was leading an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Moscow.

Mr Trump has dismissed the probe as a ""charade"", a claim directly contradicted by Mr Comey's successor.

In his first interview since firing the FBI director, Mr Trump told NBC News he had asked Mr Comey whether he was under investigation.

""I said, if it's possible would you let me know, 'Am I under investigation?' He said: 'You are not under investigation.'""

""I know I'm not under investigation,"" Mr Trump told the interviewer.

The president also appeared to undercut the initial White House explanation that he fired Mr Comey on the recommendation of top justice officials.

""He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. The FBI has been in turmoil. I was going to fire Comey. My decision,"" Mr Trump said.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

The White House has depicted the Russia inquiry as ""probably one of the smallest things"" that the FBI has ""got going on their plate"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump was with Henry Kissinger when he told reporters James Comey was ""not doing a good job"" as FBI chief

But acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that it was ""a highly significant investigation"".

In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.

""I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,"" Mr McCabe said.

The acting FBI director vowed not to update the White House on the status of the investigation and to notify the Senate panel of any attempt to interfere with the inquiry.

Republican committee chairman Richard Burr asked Mr McCabe if he had ever heard Mr Comey tell Mr Trump the president was not the subject of investigation.

Mr McCabe said he could not comment on an ongoing inquiry.

There are reports the ex-FBI boss had asked for more resources to conduct the probe and Democrats in the US Senate have formally requested details from the Justice Department on any additional funding he requested.

Some Democratic senators say they believed the reports to be true; a Justice Department spokeswoman rejected them as ""totally false"".

Democrats are also calling for a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation.

In other developments:

In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey said he would not ""spend time on the decision or the way it was executed""

The president is ""very likely"" to visit the FBI headquarters in the next few days, says the White House

Mr Comey reportedly refused to preview his Senate testimony to top Trump aides, Reuters reports

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was reportedly on the verge of resigning after the White House cast him as the prime catalyst for firing Mr Comey, US media reported.

He detailed Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" in a memo to President Trump, just prior to the firing.

Mr Rosenstein demanded the White House make clear the decision was the president's, according to US media.

""I'm not aware of his threatening to resign,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC's programme Good Morning America on Thursday.

Rosenstein's way out - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Rod Rosenstein brought a reputation for even-handedness and probity with him to the job of deputy attorney general. Two weeks later, that reputation is being put to the test.

Such is life in the Trump White House, where every appointee and aide is just one tweet, event or press conference away from the maelstrom.

On Tuesday night, as the administration press shop scrambled to explain the president's surprise decision to sack his FBI director, Trump supporters leaned hard on Mr Rosenstein's credentials to paint the move as a nonpartisan decision based on Mr Comey's overall job performance.

The deputy attorney general reportedly balked at the characterisation that he was the driving force behind Mr Comey's dismissal, however.

Mr Rosenstein's threat to resign is different than actually packing bags, of course, and his fate at this point is still tethered firmly to the president he chose to serve.

There is a way out, though. Due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal on the matter, it's Mr Rosenstein's call whether to appoint a special counsel to head the Justice Department's Russia investigation. It may be the one card he can play to sidestep the growing frenzy that spins around him.

6,About the claim FBI rank-and-file had lost faith in Comey ...,"Story highlights Andrew McCabe's comments were far more about him defending a friend

Sticking up for Comey is actually the least politically expedient thing that McCabe could do

Washington (CNN) One of the main reasons that President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday night was because the rank-and-file workers at the bureau simply didn't like Comey and, more importantly, didn't feel like they could trust him.

That was the line of argument coming from the White House on Wednesday via deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

""The President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey,"" she said at the daily press briefing . ""The DOJ lost confidence in Director Comey. Bipartisan members of Congress made it clear that they had lost confidence in Director Comey. And, most importantly, the rank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director.""

Then, later, she added: ""We've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with acting Director (Andrew) McCabe later today to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the FBI -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the FBI if he feels that that's necessary and appropriate.""

During an interview with NBC on Thursday, Trump doubled down on the idea that Comey wasn't liked within the FBI. ""He's a show boat, he's a grand stander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" Trump told Lester Holt.

6,Deputy AG Rosenstein says he's 'not quitting',"Story highlights Rosenstein was involved in the firing earlier this week of FBI Director James Comey

Rosenstein has also expressed frustration at how the White House handled the Comey dismissal

Washington (CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein denies he threatened to quit his post amid the firing of FBI Director James Comey and does not plan to resign.

After a meeting with Senate intelligence committee leaders on Capitol Hill Thursday, Rosenstein was asked by a Sinclair Broadcast Group reporter whether he threatened to quit.

""No,"" Rosenstein said, adding he is ""not quitting.""

Rosenstein was involved in the firing earlier this week of Comey, having met with President Donald Trump and writing a memo on Comey's actions as FBI director.

Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr told reporters Comey did not come up in the meeting.

Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers might look similar to those we’ve seen from the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, however, it doesn’t need a tracker. Rather than setting up light boxes IR cameras, sensors in the headset work in tandem with the motion controllers to deliver precise sub-millimeter control and responsive tracking of movement in the user’s field of view.

It’s a far simpler setup we appreciate and given the lower hardware requirements of Microsoft’s Mixed Reality platform, we might actually be able take to a friend’s house and share.

Unfortunately, Microsoft decided not to demo the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers on stage, so we won't get a good look at how well they work until we get some hands on time with them.

What’s even, more impressive about this whole setup is the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers on stage with Acer Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display will come bundled together for just $399 (about £310, AU$540) – and the bundle is available for pre-order right now.

Microsoft also announced Acer and HP Mixed reality headsets on their own are also up for pre-order on the Microsoft Store for $299 (about £230, AU$400) and $329 (about £250, AU$440), respectively.

LaVar Ball has a preordained message for Kobe Bryant: Mentoring his NBA-bound son, Lonzo, is unnecessary.

Never mind the fact that the five-time champion has mentored NBA stars Isaiah Thomas, Russell Westbrook and James Harden, to name a few.

“I don’t need no advice from Kobe Bryant.”

That’s the latest soundbite from basketball’s most polarizing father figure, adding to the long list of quotable statements that most recently included saying Michael Jordan is “not Lonzo Ball” when it came to selling his eye-popping $495 sneakers.

MORE NBA NEWS:

“I don’t need advice from Kobe Bryant. ‘Zo’s got to play his game,” LaVar said on ESPN Radio 710 LA.

""If they're at practice and he sees something, and Lonzo listens to him or whatever, he's good. ... But it's just not, 'OK, I'm talking to Kobe, so now I'm going to be good.' If Kobe sees something that 'Zo is doing, then go from there. But I'm not trying to pattern after nobody.""

Both LaVar and Lonzo have expressed interest in being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Bryant, who retired last season after an illustrious NBA career — all in Los Angeles — has said he’s an “open book” to Lakers and NBA players.

9,3 reasons behind the Cubs' lackluster start (and how to fix them) | FOX Sports,"This time last year, the Chicago Cubs were showing that they were a team of destiny. They started 24-6, had the best ERA in baseball, and had two MVP candidates raking at the plate.

The start to the 2017 season has been a bit different.

After nearly being no-hit by German Marquez on Wednesday (he's a real pitcher, I assure you), the Cubs fell to 17-17 on the year. After losing five of six, they sit in fourth place in the National League Central, behind the Cardinals, Brewers and Reds.

It's easy to claim that a World Series hangover is the culprit of the Cubs' early-season malaise.

""The reality is we can't take anything for granted and right now, I feel like we do,"" catcher Miguel Montero said this week.

9,49ers deny report that they're trying to trade NaVorro Bowman | FOX Sports,"The San Francisco 49ers have a lot of issues on defense, so it’d be a surprise to see them shopping one of their best players on that side of the ball. However, on Thursday, a report surfaced from The Ringer that the Niners are open to dealing NaVorro Bowman, their stud linebacker.

Yes, Bowman has dealt with injuries in the past three years, but the 49ers have little reason to trade their starting inside linebacker. Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch issued a joint statement denying the report, saying they’re looking forward to Bowman’s future contributions.

Joint statement from #49ers General Manager @JohnLynch49ers and Head Coach Kyle Shanahan pic.twitter.com/PPml2EQAcQ — Bob Lange (@49ersPR) May 11, 2017

Bowman played just four games last season before tearing his Achilles, the second significant injury he’s suffered in the past three years. He hasn’t been the same player since tearing his ACL in January 2014, which forced him to miss all of the following season.

The 49ers did draft Reuben Foster, but he’ll be a running mate with Bowman, not a replacement. Having those two at inside linebacker will give the 49ers a formidable duo, which should improve their abysmal run defense from a year ago.

Not to mention, the 49ers have Bowman under contract through 2022 after signing him to a four-year extension last offseason. It seems pretty unlikely that the 49ers would trade their stud linebacker just one year into his contract.",fox-sports
6,Is Roger Stone making good on a 40-year-old grudge?,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book "" Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success "" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Though many individuals likely contributed to the President's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, one notable one may have been Roger Stone, a 64-year-old close friend of Donald Trump and central figure in the FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia.

In the middle of the Watergate scandal, Stone, who engaged in dirty tricks during Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign, was discovered to have hired a Republican operative to infiltrate the George McGovern campaign and was subsequently fired from his job. After the President's resignation, Stone remained an ardent Nixon apologist and loyalist. He even had the man's face tattooed on his back and devoted his life to ruthless, anything-goes politics (or political consulting, as you may know it). Stone's motto was and continues to be: ""Admit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack."" And anyone who has watched Trump closely over the years would think it was his personal slogan, too.

Stone was introduced to Trump in the 1980s by the notorious Roy Cohn. Then a Manhattan lawyer who represented several reputed mobsters, Cohn had become infamous in the 1950s as the chief inquisitor during Joe McCarthy's ""Red Scare"" hearings in the United States Senate. After McCarthy's inquisition was shut down, Cohn began a new life as a political and legal fixer. He became a mentor to Stone and Trump and taught both men how to manipulate the media and bully opponents. After he died, they carried on in his spirit.

In Cohn's absence, Stone became Trump's main adviser for many political efforts, beginning with a flirtation with a run for the White House in 1987 (Trump even gave a speech in New Hampshire). But as much as Trump may have appreciated Stone's extreme pugnaciousness, he also had his reservations. Stone traffics in conspiracy theories and misogyny (see his disgraceful comments about Hillary Clinton) and has repeatedly suggested that leading political figures should be killed or kill themselves.

In 2015, Trump called Stone a "" loser "" and made a show of separating himself from him. Then, in the spring of 2016, Trump seemed to embrace him again. ""Roger is never too far away from Trump,"" a source told Dylan Byers of CNN Politics. ""He's always talking to Donald."" Yet another source said, ""Roger and Trump always wind up finding their way back to each other.""

In the White House, Trump has continued to answer calls from old friends, and Stone seems to be among them. Days ago, the DailyCaller published a story with the headline, ""Roger Stone still talks with President Trump."" Reporter Kerry Picket wrote, ""Republican political operative Roger Stone says he still communicates with President Donald Trump, and the last conversation he had was relatively recent.""

Both CNN and Politico are now reporting that Stone has been among those urging Trump to fire Comey. And the President's longtime friend would have reason to want Comey fired. Stone is at the center of the controversy over Russia's attempt to influence the 2016 election -- after tweeting a message that predicted trouble for Clinton campaign official John Podesta, whose hacked emails were then published by WikiLeaks. Stone also hinted at an ""October surprise"" that would be devastating to Clinton and said he had communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

More recently, as he was subject to more scrutiny, Stone called the FBI probe into his activities "" a witch hunt ."" In taking on the FBI directly, Stone employed his longstanding strategy of always staying on the offensive. Operatives who use this method view every conflict as a matter of survival, which justifies the use of any weapon that might be at hand. Thus, an opponent can be labeled a criminal, and crowds can be exhorted with chants of ""lock her up."" No tactic is too low if you are fighting for your life.

Trump has adopted a similar approach to dealing with those who oppose him. His violent rhetoric about protesters -- ""I'd like to punch him in the face"" -- at his campaign stops and his indulgence of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones of InfoWars, a radical right-wing radio show host, showed that he, too, was comfortable doing whatever was required to get what he wanted.

In addition to their aggression, Trump and Stone also share a preference for defying convention. One reliable way to do this involves making statements that are too shocking to believe. Thus, we have Stone responding to Comey's firing with the comment it's "" about time "" and then Trump taking to Twitter to say, ""Have not spoken to Roger in a long time -- had nothing to do with my decision."" Stone later took to Twitter as well, saying that while he hadn't ""urged"" the President to dismiss Comey, he supported his decision ""100%.""

Understanding this ruthless Stone/Trump approach makes it easier to recognize what may have happened with Comey. Since the FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia was hitting close to home, both Trump and Stone stood to benefit from Comey's dismissal. And given their 30-year history of working together to further their objectives by any means necessary, this decision fits well within an existing paradigm.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

With Comey's firing, we now have a new demonstration of the lengths to which these men will go to thwart their opponents. Under Stone's apparent influence, Trump has sacrificed the integrity of the presidency and thrown the nation into a political crisis that may eventually rival the one provoked by Nixon's abuse of presidential power. As CNN contributor Jeffrey Toobin noted, Stone subscribes to "" Nixonian hardball ,"" which includes using what others consider unethical methods in order to win.

He and Trump have brought this style of play back to the White House.",cnn
6,Donald Trump insisted Comey exonerated him. Not exactly...,"(CNN) President Donald Trump reiterated Thursday that deposed FBI director James Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation for his campaign's ties to Russian intelligence officials.

""He told me that ... and I've heard that from others,"" Trump told NBC's Lester Holt.

The President added that Comey told him he was not under investigation once during a ""very nice dinner"" and two other times over the phone. That's consistent with the letter Trump sent Comey informing him that he had been fired; ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,"" Trump wrote.

There have been a whole lot of reasons to be skeptical of Trump's assertion that Comey just kept telling him he was not being investigated.

1. The FBI investigation is focused in part, at the moment, on Trump campaign associates like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former foreign policy aide Carter Page. ""At the moment"" is the key thing there. This is an ongoing investigation, meaning that the FBI continues to work on it. That Trump isn't currently under investigation doesn't necessarily, therefore, tell us as much as he wants us to think it tells us.

9,Anderson Silva officially out of UFC 212 in Brazil | FOX Sports,"Former middleweight champion Anderson Silva has officially been pulled from UFC 212 in Brazil on June 3.

Silva was expected to face former “Ultimate Fighter” winner Kelvin Gastelum on the card, but Gastelum was yanked from the matchup after he returned a positive drug test for marijuana following his last bout against Vitor Belfort in March.

Silva had previously announced earlier this week that he was bringing his training camp to an end with no new opponent on the horizon for the upcoming show in Rio de Janeiro.

UFC officials confirmed on Thursday that Silva will not stay on the card after no deal could be reached to find him a new opponent.

“Following the April 6 removal of Kelvin Gastelum from his UFC 212 bout against Anderson Silva, UFC officials attempted to find a replacement to meet Silva on June 3. However, an opponent was not secured to face the former middleweight champion on short notice, prompting his removal from the card at Jeunesse Arena in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,” UFC officials wrote in a statement on Thursday.

Silva last competed at UFC 208 in February where he earned a decision victory over Derek Brunson.

There’s no word yet on when Silva will fight again, although he had recently threatened that without an interim title on the line for his next bout, he may consider retirement.

UFC president Dana White quickly shot down that idea by saying no interim title would be introduced in the middleweight division.

It’s unclear at this time when or if Silva will be booked for his next matchup.",fox-sports
9,Carl Long cleared to compete in first Cup race since 2009 | FOX Sports,"One of the strangest stories ever in NASCAR has taken yet another surprising turn.

Carl Long, the owner/driver of a low-budget team in what is now the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, was kicked out of the Cup garage in 2009 because the engine in his car for the Sprint Showdown last-chance all-star qualifying race at Charlotte Motor Speedway was deemed by NASCAR officials to be 0.17 cubic inches too big.

Long was fined $200,000 for the offense, at the time the largest fine in NASCAR history.

Because Long was unable to repay the fine, he was banished from the Cup garage, although he was still permitted to race in the NASCAR XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series, which he did intermittently.

Long has not raced in the Cup Series since the oversized engine incident.

That may change this weekend.

NASCAR confirmed on Thursday that Long has cleared to race in the Cup Series. “We do know that he has satisfied all necessary requirements to compete,” a NASCAR representative told FOXSports.com.

Apparently, Long will attempt to enter Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 at Kansas Speedway.

6,Trump orders 'voter fraud' commission as FBI firing fallout lingers,"President Trump boards Air Force One before his departure from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on May 4, 2017. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)

WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to set up a commission to study his unproven allegations of voter fraud in last year's presidential election, as he continues to grapple with the fallout from his abrupt and controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey.

The commission will be chaired by Vice President Pence, who will be joined by up to 15 other members. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will serve as the commission's vice chair, according to White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders.

""The Commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people's confidence in the integrity of Federal elections — including improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting, and voting suppression,"" the White House said in a statement.

Trump, who lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 2.9 million votes, has claimed that last year's election included up to 3 million to 5 million fraudulent voters — but there is no evidence to back this assertion.

Trump's executive order creating the commission comes as Democrats and other critics accuse him of firing Comey to obstruct an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians who tried to influence last year's election.

The president is planning a visit to the FBI headquarters in the coming days to calm the waters, administration officials said. But the unexpected announcement of the new commission — which was not on Trump's public schedule for the day — might be seen as a way to distract from the firestorm unleashed by the Comey firing earlier this week.

Meanwhile, federal and state election officials from both parties have disputed Trump's claims of massive voter fraud. They say there have been few, if any, incidents of people voting when they were not registered – or voting by people who were not American citizens.

""Every election is going to have issues, but I don’t think that three to five million people voting illegally was one of those issues,"" said Thomas Hicks, chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission said in January in USA TODAY.

Election officials have said they worry Trump’s claims could shake the faith of voters, particularly at a time when the FBI and Congress are investigating whether Russia interfered in last year’s presidential election.

For his part, Trump has stood by his claim.

""We'll see after the committee,"" Trump told Time magazine in March.

Trump had originally been expected to sign the executive order creating the voter commission in late January, but it has been consistently been put off.

Already, voting rights advocates are blasting Thursday's expected order.

“In no uncertain terms we condemn the launch of this so-called Presidential Commission on Election Integrity,’’ Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement. “President Trump is trying to create a distraction from actual threats to our democracy, such as ongoing voter suppression and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.’’

Voting rights advocates say the administration should focus on making access to the polls easier instead of unfounded claims of voter fraud. They argue some lawmakers are using the claim to ramp up more restrictive election laws.

States, mostly controlled by Republican legislatures, have adopted more election laws, including voter ID, in recent years. Supporters say they help protect against voter fraud.

Trump's order could get support from some Republican lawmakers, who have welcomed a federal investigation into allegations of voter fraud.

“Safeguarding our democracy requires fair and accurate elections,” Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., chairman of the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections, said earlier this year.

6,White House: Removing Comey will help bring Russia investigation to end,"Story highlights Trump fired Comey Tuesday

The FBI is investigating possible Trump campaign connections to Russia's election hacking

(CNN) The White House said Thursday that removing FBI Director James Comey from his post may hasten the agency's investigation into Russian meddling.

""We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,"" said deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders, referring to the FBI's probe into Moscow's interference in last year's election. ""And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.""

The statement was a surprising admission from the White House that Comey's sudden dismissal on Tuesday may have an effect on the Russia probe. Officials have insisted the removal came because of Comey's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, and was unrelated to his oversight of the look into Russia's election hacking and possible ties between Trump advisers and Russian operatives.

Sanders said Thursday that Trump would ""love nothing more for this investigation to continue to its completion.""

But Trump himself has cast doubt on the investigation, suggesting any question of ties between his campaign and Russia are a ""hoax.""

6,Many Trump backers are 'totally OK' with Comey firing,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is under fire again, this time for his firing of former FBI Director James Comey . But many of his supporters aren't joining the outcry.

CNN spoke to voters across the country, most of them Trump backers, and while some of them expressed surprise at Comey's ouster, few said it changed their image of the leader of the free world.

Here's what they had to say:

Jake Lee, business owner

Lee, 46, of West Hollywood, California, said he believes Trump made ""the right decision"" in axing Comey.

""As far as the Comey thing goes, I think he gave him plenty of chances. I think what became the last straw was when he (Comey) made that statement about the classified emails showing up on (Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin's and her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner's) laptop. You can't have rules for the elitist ruling class and not have those rules apply to everybody else. I think in my opinion that was part of (Trump's) decision. The guy likes to run a tight ship.""

As for concerns that Comey's firing could affect the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia, Lee doesn't see it as an issue.

""You know, I think (Trump's) a lot smarter than that. If he were to fire him and then later ... the news got out that he was actually involved with Russia -- which I don't believe so -- that would be even worse. The cover-up would be worse than the actual crime, and I don't think that he would put himself in that situation. The guy, in my opinion, is super smart.""

Willie Standley, clothing store owner

Standley, 53, of York, Pennsylvania, says he has no issue with Comey's firing, although he was surprised by it and wonders what effect his ouster will have on the investigation into Trump's Russia ties. He also thinks the matter has become entirely too political.

""I think we should take the politics out of it. Get a special investigation to go out there and get the truth to go ahead and serve America, not the politicians.

""When a person is in office they should have people around them that are going to go ahead and support what they stand for. I own my own business, and if someone went ahead and undermined me and my business, I would fire them too.""

Standley, however, would like to see a special investigation into the firing.

""There should be a special investigation. Trump is not right. Something is definitely not right because the timing and everything is not good. It's not good at all. Something smells with Trump. I don't have blind loyalty -- no way -- because ... I don't trust politicians. And that's part of why I voted for (Trump) because he wasn't a politician. But once he stepped in there doing the things that he's done ... he's going at it like a politician, not a businessman.""

So, after the ordeal, is Standley still happy he cast his vote for Trump?

""I would say it's early on, but no. But I still think he's going to be better than Hillary would have been. Time will tell. ... ""He is serving himself and not the people.""

Leo Palis, graphic designer

Palis, 59, of Miami, is a Hillary Clinton supporter and says Comey ""had it coming. ... I do believe Comey was the reason why Hillary lost the election. You can't blame the guy 100% but he was a major piece of that loss, so I don't feel any sympathy for the guy.

""If Trump said he was doing a bad job, maybe he was doing a good job because of all these Russian connections and who knows what was going on and is going on inside the White House. Sooner or later, it's going to explode. It's only a matter of time.

""The people of the United States will know what's going on with Russia. Russia has been the enemy since Day One, and the fact that (Trump) sympathizes with them from the beginning, it tells you something about what is going on. And he is a liar, so you can't trust him, and someone has to do the job. Comey was on it, but he got fired ... so hopefully it falls into someone else's hands who can finish up the job.""

Dane Roche, project manager

Roche, 25, of Greeley, Colorado, says he didn't vote for Trump so much as he voted against Clinton. Overall, he said, he's frustrated and feels the country is too divided -- and that the media is exacerbating that division.

As for the Comey firing, Roche said it was unexpected.

""I wouldn't say it's the best way to do it, but I don't get to choose. ... I was surprised but not surprised. Nothing surprises me anymore.""

Asked whether he still supports Trump, he said the Comey firing didn't move the needle for him, and he remains pleased that Clinton is not head of state.

""There are too many things going on right now. Politics are a s**t show.""

John Corry, real estate broker

Corry, of Chicago, said he might have been surprised by Comey's firing a couple of years ago, but not now.

""Nothing surprises me anymore, particularly after what just happened in the election. ... There is no normal or status quo anymore, as much as the Democrats and Republicans try and cram it down our throats.""

""The situation with Comey is interesting because if you go back seven months the Democrats wanted to lynch him. He had all these fireable offenses. ... ""Do I think he got a raw deal? Probably, but that's the nature of politics.""

The situation hasn't affected his opinion of Trump, although he does wonder why liberals don't see that their aversion to Trump is not so different from conservatives' feelings toward Barack Obama during his presidency.

""What's frustrating to me is that the left still doesn't get it, six months later. This isn't about Trump. It's about the vote. ... If you look at what happened with Obama, there was just as much pushback (to his actions), so the hypocrisy is right before everyone's eyes.""

""(Trump's) erratic and sophomoric at times ... but I'm supportive in regards to hoping that he is able to steer the country in a better direction fiscally and constitutionally. I'm hopeful.""

Evelio Medina, chamber president

Medina, 53, of Miami, is a big Trump supporter who helped organize the Deplorables Inauguration Ball in Washington D.C. earlier this year.

""I'm totally OK with the firing, not necessarily how it went down. I wish it had been a little more elegant,"" said the president and CEO of the Downtown Miami & Brickell Chamber of Commerce. ""Trump is unorthodox. I don't always have to agree with his form and fashion, but he's always gonna do it his way, just like the (Frank Sinatra) song.""

""It was essential to bring back the role of the FBI. (Comey) took liberties he never should have. ... He became political, and once you became political you can win and you can lose. Comey lost,"" he said. ""The Democrats haven't accepted that they lost the election. ... They hated Comey, and now they love Comey.""

Asked if he was concerned Comey's firing could have any affect on federal investigations into White House ties to Russia, Medina told CNN he feels the Russia issue is overblown.

""It became sexy all the sudden. I haven't seen any evidence of Russian collusion. Russia didn't pick me up, drive me to the polls and tell me which way to vote.""

Everett Stoner, retired meat cutter

Stoner, 80, is originally from Detroit but has lived in Greeley, Colorado, with his wife of 40 years for almost a decade. The Army veteran voted for Trump and thinks he's doing a good job, but he conceded no politician is perfect.

In regard to firing Comey, Trump was ""well within his rights and should've done it a long time ago. ... We need new blood."" He doesn't care for Comey because he thinks the former FBI director protected Clinton, which amounted, in his opinion, to Comey ""acting as a judge, not an investigator.""

He also appreciated the unexpected nature of Trump's announcement: ""Trump doesn't broadcast what he's gonna do; he just does it, and I like that.""

Bob Ruscoe, liquidator

Ruscoe, 57, of West Palm Beach, Florida, says he still feels in the dark about the Comey firing.

""There's a lot going on that I don't know about, so it's hard to make an opinion on something when you're only getting what they want us to know. I'm just like, 'Wow, sounds like how Washington works.' You know, there's a lot of stuff going on we'll never know about in history.""

As for the possible ramifications on the Russia investigation, Ruscoe said, ""I don't know what's going on. Stuff looks a whole lot different from where I'm looking at it then what it actually is ... I don't think we may ever know the actual truth.""",cnn

10,iPhone 8 leaked images show an all glass design,"This might be our best look yet at the iPhone 8 – or at least renders of it, based on leaked CAD blueprints.

The images show the phone from all angles, and highlight a metal frame and a shiny glass back, making for a marked departure from the metal-backed iPhone 7.

There’s also a vertically aligned dual-lens camera, in place of the horizontally aligned one on the iPhone 7 Plus. This has been rumored before and it’s thought that the change could somehow be needed to help with rumored augmented reality functions of the phone.

Image 1 of 3 Image 2 of 3 Image 3 of 3

Big screen, small body

The port and button placement largely seems similar to what’s gone before though, with two speaker grilles and a Lightning port on the bottom edge, a power button on the right edge and volume buttons on the left.

Apparently the iPhone 8 pictured here has dimensions of 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm, which would make it slightly bigger in all dimensions than the 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm iPhone 7, but smaller (though still slightly thicker) than the iPhone 7 Plus.

Despite that it will probably have a bigger screen than either, with many current rumors pointing to a 5.8-inch display, achieved by removing the home button and having an all-screen front, as you can also see in these images.

The source of this leak theorizes that the fingerprint scanner could instead be built either into the display itself, as has been rumored a number of times, or into the Apple logo on the back.

These images largely line up with a dummy unit we saw previously. That too was supposedly based on leaked designs, so the source diagrams could be the same.

These latest images were sourced for MySmartPrice by @OnLeaks, who is one of the more reputable leakers in the business, but they themselves aren’t certain that this will be the iPhone 8’s final form, as Apple has apparently been working on a number of prototypes, so this could end up being an unused design.

We might not know for sure until September, when the iPhone 8 is expected to be officially announced.",techradar
10,Would you let a robot perform your eye surgery? One just passed clinical trials,"The idea of having your eyes operated on is a pretty terrifying proposal at the best of times, but throw robot surgeons into the mix and it suddenly feels very James Bond. But robot optical surgery is now a very real possibility thanks to the University of Oxford in the UK.

For the first time a robot has passed clinical trials to perform highly delicate retinal surgery, meaning it could soon become a fixture in hospital wards. The robot, named R2D2 (yes, really) outperformed its human counterparts in the control group.

The reason that a robot is proving so effective in this field is the microscopic level of movement needed to perform the surgery, well outside the capabilities of even the most competent surgeon.

Talking to the BBC about the Robotic Retinal Dissection Device (R2D2), the program’s director Dr Robert MacLaren said: “Current technology with laser scanners and microscopes allows us to monitor retinal diseases at the microscopic level, but the things we see are beyond the physiological limit of what the human hand can operate on.

""With a robotic system, we open up a whole new chapter of eye operations that currently cannot be performed.”

Slow and steady

In order to operate on a retina, an incision 10 microns deep at the back of the eye is necessary. For reference, a human hair averages at about 60 microns. As precise as human surgeons are, even the pulse of their heart is enough to move their hand more than 10 microns.

The clinical trial took the form of 12 retina membrane removal operations, 6 by human surgeons, 6 by R2D2. In the group operated on by the human surgeons, there were five micro-hemorrhages (minor bleeds) and two retinal touches, which we feel a bit queasy just writing. In comparison, R2D2 only had two micro-hemorrhages and one retinal touch.

If it helps set your mind at ease, the robot is still controlled by a human surgeon so it isn’t deciding where and when to cut, yet.

9,Why Mitchell Trubisky drove his grandma's 1997 Toyota to Bears minicamp | FOX Sports,"Mitchell Trubisky has yet to sign an NFL contract, which will eventually make him a millionaire. Even when he does sign on the dotted line, though, he’ll probably still drive the same old car he always has.

The rookie currently drives a 1997 Toyota Camry with more than 170,000 miles on it. When he was drafted by the Bears, general manager Ryan Pace made him promise to drive the Camry all the way from Chapel Hill to Lake Forest for rookie minicamp.

On Thursday, Trubisky arrived, sticking to his word.

Ryan Pace made Tru promise he'd drive his car, formerly grandma's car, to Halas Hall. The kid kept his promise. pic.twitter.com/Lxil2nJkiB — Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) May 11, 2017

It’s amazing that a car that old with nearly 200,000 miles could make it from North Carolina to Illinois, but it made it. The Camry used to belong to his grandmother, and he’s kept it in the family ever since he received it from her. Why?

“I’m a very simple person,” Trubisky said, via CBS Chicago. “That’s who I’ve always been, that’s how I was raised, to be conservative and stick to who I am. That’s who I’m going to be.”

This is similar to Kirk Cousins driving his family’s old van, and Alfred Morris still pushing the car he bought for $2 from his pastor as a college junior. Perhaps there’s just something about being comfortable in an old ride.

Eventually, Trubisky will have to buy a new ride, just don’t expect that to happen any time soon.",fox-sports
9,Stipe Miocic: 'Keep doubting me' and 'I'm going to keep shutting you up' | FOX Sports,"Stipe Miocic knows all the facts about the heavyweight title.

He’s heard how no champion in UFC history has ever defended the belt more than two times and that includes a laundry list of legends like Hall of Famers Mark Coleman and Randy Couture.

Still, defying the odds is something Miocic does best and that’s why he truly believes he’s the one who will break through that glass ceiling to defend the heavyweight title on more than two occasions.

“Keep doubting me, please. I love it. I’m going to keep shutting you up,” Miocic told FOX Sports ahead of his fight against Junior dos Santos at UFC 211.

“Just keep telling me that I’m not good and I’m not going to win and I’ll keep shutting you up.”

Part of Miocic’s confidence actually stems from his first fight with dos Santos back in 2014.

On that night, dos Santos earned a hard fought decision over Miocic, which was only the second time the Cleveland, OH native has suffered a defeat in his career. As heartbreaking as it was to suffer that loss, Miocic also believes that fight was the turning point in his career that eventually brought him to the championship.

It might sound strange but Miocic is actually grateful to dos Santos for what happened in their first fight because it gave him everything he needed to know he could hang with the best of the best in the UFC before one day becoming king.

“I’m at where I’m at because of that fight. I want to thank him for that fight,” Miocic said. “Because that’s where I’m at today because of him. I put myself in that position. He’s an animal. He’s a former champ and he’s going to stay a former champ because I’m going to stay champ. Fighting him changed everything. I made a comment to my coach actually that night, I said if we fought tomorrow, I’d beat him. Because I knew what I did wrong and I knew what I had to do.

“Things changed. Come see May 13, see what happens.”

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports

The grueling war with dos Santos was also the first time Miocic had prepared for five rounds much less actually gone that far into a fight so it was a learning experience for the future.

Since that time, Miocic has earned four consecutive knockouts including his title fight victory over Fabricio Werdum as well as his first defense against Alistair Overeem this past September at UFC 203.

But it was all predicated on that 25-minute battle with dos Santos that not only showed Miocic he belonged amongst the best fighters in the world, but it forced him to get that much better so he would never suffer through another loss like that again.

“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. It showed me that I have everything I need to be champion. I’m getting more and more amped thinking about it and thanking him,” Miocic said. “It’s going to be a lot different on May 13, I’ll tell you right now. I am a completely different person. I feel like nobody gives me the props, which is fine, I love it. I love being the underdog.

“I always feel like I’m the underdog. I feel like I’m the underdog in this fight cause he beat me the last time and everyone thinks he had a good fight against Ben Rothwell. Good for him. Nothing’s going to change. Make me the underdog. I love shutting people up.”

Miocic has faced his fair share of naysayers over the years, but he’s also heard dos Santos talk about dominating this rematch after already holding a win over him from nearly three years ago.

In fact, dos Santos has predicted that he will finish Miocic inside two rounds, which earned a smirk and then a grimace from the reigning and defending heavyweight champion when he heard that news.

In response, Miocic won’t be as brash as to call his shot when he’ll put dos Santos away, but he promises the judges can take the rest of the night off once the main event starts on Saturday night.

“It’s not going the distance. He knows it, I know it and I’m the one that’s winning. I’m walking out with the belt still wrapped around my waist,” Miocic said.

“You’ll find out when I have my hand raised May 13. But I’m winning. I’m walking out with that belt still around my waist. I’ll tell you that right now. That’s going to happen for damn sure.”",fox-sports
6,No one can save Trump from himself,"(CNN) So maybe a few times in your life you have screamed at the television set. And then what? You flip the channel, and get on with your life.

Ah, unless you're the current President of the United States. Because he probably watches way more TV than you do, and when he sees something he doesn't like, he doesn't flip. He stews. He calls his friends and complains. He tweets.

And then he acts, because he can.

According to a source with knowledge, Trump told friends he was increasingly concerned that FBI Director James Comey had grown ""out of control"" and was ""pursuing his own agenda."" Comey's testimony last week, this source says, ""pushed him to the edge.""

So he acted out, and decided to fire Comey, in a childish, impetuous -- and dangerous -- manner. Then he looked for a rationale, and found it in a memo written by Rod Rosenstein, deputy attorney general.

The White House used that cover story; so did the vice president. But now Trump has blown up that explanation by telling NBC that he would have fired Comey no matter what Justice officials had recommended. (Did Trump lie to Pence like Mike Flynn did? Just asking.)

And all credibility is lost.

JUST WATCHED Trump biographers' insights on first 100 days Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump biographers' insights on first 100 days 04:11

Apparently, no one is able to tell the 70-year-old newbie how to behave. That firing the current FBI director in the middle of the Russia investigation -- no matter how tarnished his reputation -- is a bad idea. No one can tell him that, no matter how furious he is about an investigation that is growing and requiring more resources, trying to kill it by striking at the FBI director is a very, very bad idea. And that it might be interpreted as obstruction of justice.

But none of this matters to Trump. It never has. As Louise Sunshine, a former Trump organization employee told me months ago, Trump had always lobbed grenades -- and then walked away.

""Nobody ever knew when he walked in a meeting what he was going to say or do because he didn't,"" she said. ""Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something that nobody else expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog, and control every situation that way, so by the time he leaves the room, he has the store, he owns the store.""

But this isn't Trump's store anymore.

Trump has clearly learned little in office. He still throws tantrums, and his staff is sent to clean up the mess.

The pattern was set on the first full day in office.

That's when Trump fumed about the pictures about crowd size at his inauguration, and sent his press secretary Sean Spicer, out there to rationalize his obsession.

Then came the president's ridiculous assertion that there were 3 million illegal votes cast in the election -- and that's why he lost the popular vote.

That's when Spicer came out to try and explain the unexplainable. The solution -- just set up a presidential commission to examine the fiction, which the White House finally announced Thursday.

Then came the president's impulsive tweet-storm early on Saturday morning, March 4, when he accused his predecessor of having him wiretapped. Never mind that he was accusing Barack Obama of a felony, or that it wasn't true. He did it, anyway.

So then, once again, came the shovel brigade. Because to balk, even a bit, would be seen as disloyal to Trump --and that is not allowed. Ever.

Only this time it was really hard to figure out how to explain the unexplainable. And so a plan was hatched: call for congressional investigations. And stop talking about Russia hacks and potential Russian collusion with the campaign, but focus instead on investigating leaks that cast a negative light on Trump and his people.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

You get the idea. The President tweets nonsense, and the staff scrambles to make it sensible. Even if the emperor has no clothes, you can't tell him.

So it was with the firing of James Comey.

The President decides he wants to fire Comey, and the staff is tasked to come up with a rationale. But it was very hard this time -- absurd on its face. After he praised Comey in late October on the campaign trail and last week his spokesman declared confidence in the FBI director, are we to suddenly believe that the president really thought Comey was unfair to Hillary? Really? As one source close to the president tells me, his real concern was that if Comey had treated Clinton so badly, he would do the same to Donald Trump.

Oh, and as he told NBC, Comey was a ""showboat"" and a ""grandstander."" It was a telling insult; in Trump's galaxy, there can be no star brighter than Trump.

One requirement of the presidency is to believe that your job is about something greater than yourself -- your country.

But first you have to believe there is something greater than yourself.",cnn

3,France's Macron announces gender equal list of political outsiders,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The president-elect had made several conditions for candidates to sign up to

The party of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron has selected a diverse list of 428 candidates for parliamentary elections next month.

Only 24 of those chosen are outgoing MPs from the current parliament.

Some 52% come from civil society and exactly half are women, the secretary-general of La République En Marche (Republic on the Move) said.

Richard Ferrand said the choices marked ""the definitive return of citizens to the heart of our political life"".

Mr Macron still needs to select more than 100 candidates for the 577-seat parliament and the party says its door is open to politicians from other parties to join.

Youngest is 24

The movement received more than 19,000 applications, Mr Ferrand said at a news conference, with 1,700 telephone interviews conducted with candidates.

The average age of the list is 46 ""compared to 60 years for the average of outgoing MPs"", he said.

The youngest candidate is 24 years old, while the oldest is 72. Around 10 candidates are unemployed, double that are retired and a handful are students.

Image copyright AFP Image caption On the list: Cédric Villani, a famous mathematician, made the cut

All of the outgoing MPs chosen to run come from the Socialist Party of departing President François Hollande.

Mr Ferrand confirmed that Mr Macron's ex-cabinet colleague Manuel Valls - the former prime minister who has now burned his boats with his Socialists - had not been selected.

He said that he did ""not meet the criteria"" because he had already served three parliamentary terms.

But the party will not be running a candidate against him in his constituency in Essonne, south of Paris.

France had been waiting to see if the party list would live up to Mr Macron's pledge to clean up France's public life.

Who are they?

Many of the candidates are unknown to the public and there are few well-known personalities on the list.

Among the diverse candidates are Cédric Villani, a famous mathematician with a penchant for flamboyant bow-ties and spider brooches. He won the Fields Medal - seen as one of the highest honours in mathematics - in 2010.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Elite police commander Jean-Michel Fauvergue is a candidate

François Hollande's communications advisor Gaspard Gantzer, former judge Éric Halphen and former bullfighter Marie Sara are also on the list.

Although no MPs of the Republican party are candidates, at least two former allies of Alain Juppé - who lost the centre-right party's presidential primary - have been selected.

Where's the right? Analysis: BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris

It has escaped no-one's attention that there are nearly 150 names still missing.

Why this lack of clarity? Why the delay? Why is Mr Macron's party unable to do what it said it would do and give the country the full roster of names?

The answer is that it is engaged in some very old-style political calculation.

Emmanuel Macron knows that his weak point is his connection with the outgoing regime. He is a socialist at heart, as he has often said, and made his name serving a Socialist Party president.

If his party goes into the election fielding too many ex-Socialist MPs, it will be a sitting target for a vengeful Republican Party, eager to get its own majority and force the new president into a ""cohabitation"" (where the government is of a different colour from the president).

So the party wants a few more days to tempt over Republican Party defectors. Only in the middle of next week will it draw up its definitive list.

Read more from Hugh

Some of the names previously announced include:

Jean-Michel Fauvergue, a police commander who led the elite RAID unit's response to several jihadist attacks including the Bataclan massacre in Paris

Laetitia Avia, a Paris barrister involved in solving corporate disputes and active in projects in sub-Saharan Africa

Farmer Jean-Baptiste Moreau, who heads a co-operative

Head teacher Mireille Robert, also involved in campaigns to tackle unemployment

Alexandre Aïdara, public servant who founded Citizen Regeneration think tank, ex-adviser to justice ministry

French media are already reporting errors on the list - including one candidate with a criminal record (the party said no-one with a criminal record would be eligible). Several people on the list have also denied they are candidates.

Why are the candidates being unveiled now?

Mr Macron was only elected on Sunday and the two-round parliamentary vote takes place on 11 and 18 June. But with only one month to go, every political party is now focusing on the race for the National Assembly.

His recently rebranded party is only 13 months old and Mr Macron needs to show he will have not just a mandate but the power in parliament to push through his programme.

Image copyright En Marche Image caption The first candidates revealed last month included a farmer, a businessman, a journalist and an elite police officer

How are the candidates chosen?

Nearly 20,000 people applied and a few thousand only added their names in the past few days following the election.

6,"Stained, missing surgical equipment at DC VA halts surgery, prompts warning","The Oklahoma City Veterans' Affairs Medical Center treats 60,000 veterans annually. (Photo: Donovan Slack, USA TODAY)

WASHINGTON — Investigators found stained surgical equipment and a surgery had to be halted at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington Wednesday because staff lacked equipment, indicating patients there are still in danger and prompting the VA’s chief watchdog to immediately notify members of Congress.

A patient prepped for vascular surgery in the operating room at the hospital had already been placed under anesthesia when “it was determined that the surgeon did not have a particular sterile instrument to perform the surgery,” VA Inspector General Michael Missal wrote in a letter Wednesday.

“The surgery was postponed,” he wrote. “In addition, we identified other surgical instruments that had color stains of unknown origin in sterile packs. This made the instrument packs unsuitable for surgeries.”

The letter, addressed to VA acting Undersecretary for Health Poonam Alaigh and copied to lawmakers, comes almost a month after Missal issued a rare report alerting the public to equipment shortages and other problems at the Washington VA that were putting patients at risk. Within hours of the report’s release April 12, VA Secretary David Shulkin removed the medical center’s director and installed a top deputy to take over.

But Missal said in his letter that eight recommendations from his report still have not been implemented. And he said his investigators’ findings on Wednesday constitute “further troubling incidents that indicate patients are being placed at unnecessary risk.”

“These further incidents raise serious concerns that surgeries and other procedures requiring sterile equipment may be performed with unsuitable equipment,” Missal wrote. “We therefore ask that you immediately take necessary and appropriate action to ensure that patients at the DC VA (Medical Center) are not placed at unnecessary risk and inform me promptly of the steps VA leadership intends to take to respond to these issues.”

Read more:

A spokesman for the VA did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Thursday. Shulkin has said he worked quickly to fix the failures identified in Missal’s report last month and that he was confident that as of two weeks ago, “patient safety is not at all compromised.""

The report last month said investigators found 18 of 25 sterile storage areas were dirty at the hospital, which serves more than 98,000 veterans in the nation’s capital. They found chemical strips used to verify equipment sterilization had expired, so tests performed on nearly 400 items were not reliable.

They found the hospital lacked an effective inventory system and equipment shortages were common. In the past three years, there were 194 reports that patient safety has been compromised because of insufficient equipment.

In the weeks before the report’s release, the operating room had ran out of vascular patches to seal blood vessels and ultrasound probes used to map blood flow. The facility had to borrow bone material for knee replacement surgeries. And at one point, the hospital ran out of tubes needed for kidney dialysis, so staff had to go to a private-sector hospital and ask for some.

The report said senior VA leaders had known about the problem for months and hadn’t fixed it.

In his letter to Aleigh, Missal did not specify which fixes remain undone. Shulkin has said VA officials put a new inventory system in place.

Missal said his office has not found any instances of “adverse patient outcomes” but his office is continuing to investigate.

16,Why Steve Harvey told talk-show staffers to leave him alone,"In a leaked staff memo, Steve Harvey reportedly laid out rules barring them from talking to him without making an appointment first. (Photo: Bryan Steffy, Getty Images for Nu-Opp, Inc)

On what should be a momentous day for his five-year-old syndicated talk show, Steve Harvey is dealing with a leaked memo in which he reportedly told staff not to speak to or approach him.

Thursday marks The Steve Harvey Show's last taping at its home at Chicago's NBC Tower before moving west to Los Angeles. When it returns this fall for Season 6, it will have a shortened title, Steve, and more celebrity guests. And thanks to a deal struck last year with NBC Universal and IMG, Harvey will have an ownership stake and more control.

Harvey, 60, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he did send the staff memo that was leaked to Chicago media blog RobertFeder.com and picked up by Variety and Deadline.com.

In the email, sent to employees as they returned to work last fall, he laid out new rules banning staffers from ""popping into"" his dressing room or the makeup room to see him or approaching him in the hallway in hopes of having a walk-and-talk meeting.

""I want all the ambushing to stop now,"" he wrote. ""That includes TV staff. You must schedule an appointment. I have been taken advantage of by my lenient policy in the past. This ends now. NO MORE.""

Harvey stressed throughout the memo that he felt he had to make changes in order to keep his work days from being eaten up by impromptu meetings and glad-handing backstage visitors. ""It is for the good of my personal life and enjoyment,"" he explained, asking them not to take offense.

He asked critics to put themselves in his shoes, noting, ""If you come out your house, you don't want anybody on your porch waiting on you. You walk to your car, you don't want people bothering you on your way to your car. Everybody wants the freedom to be able to move around.""

Later, he described the daily interruptions to ET: ""Look, man, I'm in my makeup chair, they walk in the room. I'm having lunch, they walk in, they don't knock,"" he continued. ""I'm in the hallway, I'm getting ambushed by people with friends that come to the show and having me sign this and do this.""

While he won't apologize for the memo's overall message, he admits, ""In hindsight, I probably should've handled it a little bit differently.""

It's worth noting that the talk show isn't the only project occupying Harvey's days. He hosts two other programs, NBC's Little Big Shots and ABC's updated Family Feud as well as a radio show, rivaling Ryan Seacrest for having the most jobs in showbiz.

It's possible the memo was leaked by one of the dozens of Harvey staffers who were not invited to move west to work on the revamped show and are now out of work.

In the last year, Harvey has come under fire for making fun of Asian men on his show as well as meeting with then President-elect Donald Trump and his HUD nominee, Dr. Ben Carson, to discuss ideas for inner-city programs during the transition.

""Our president (Obama) asked that all of us sit down and talk to one another in order to move our country forward,"" the host of Family Feud and The Steve Harvey Show noted in a statement posted to Twitter in mid-January. ""The transition teams on both sides asked me to meet and I'm glad I did.""

Harvey also reached meme status last year when he announced the wrong winner at the end of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant, a blunder he was reminded of many times during the 2016 pageant and that is likely to end up in his obituary. But he's learned to have a sense of humor about it.

After a similar snafu happened during the presentation of this year's best-picture Oscar, he extended an offer to presenter Warren Beatty: ""Call me. I can help you get through this.""

9,Jeurys Familia is the latest Met to be lost for extended period | FOX Sports,"The New York Mets took another hit on Thursday, when they announced closer Jeurys Familia has been diagnosed with an arterial clot in his right (pitching) shoulder and might need surgery.

Jeurys Familia was examined today by doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery and diagnosed with an arterial clot is his right shoulder. — New York Mets (@Mets) May 11, 2017

Familia is heading to St. Louis to meet with Dr. Robert Thompson, an expert in circulation issues who diagnosed and performed surgery on Matt Harvey last summer. He also performed the 2012 surgery on then-Mets pitcher Dillon Gee, who was similarly diagnosed with a blood clot in his shoulder. Gee also missed the rest of the season.

Thompson is considered the leading expert on thoracic outlet syndrome…. https://t.co/D7MMrM0EeP — Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) May 11, 2017

#Mets didn't offer timetable/severity/treatment for Familia. David Cone had an arterial blood clot near arm pit in '96, missed 4 months. — Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) May 11, 2017

Familia missed the first 15 games of the 2017 regular season because of a suspension, the result of an alleged offseason domestic violence incident. Since his return, he has not been as effective as the past two seasons when he was a dominant force out of the Mets’ bullpen. Familia has three saves and a 3.86 ERA in 11 appearances this season. He led the National League with 51 saves in 2016.

On Wednesday, Familia blew his first save of the year, allowing four runs (three earned) in one-third of an inning in a 6-5 loss to the Giants.

The injury news about Familia comes on top of the controversy stirred when starter Matt Harvey was suspended for three games after failing to show up this past Saturday. Another of the Mets’ young arms, Noah Syndergaard, has also been lost for an extended period due to a lat injury. Syndergaard joined fellow starters Seth Lugo (elbow) and Steven Matz (elbow) – and multiple other teammates – on the disabled list last week.

10,Microsoft Build 2017: the biggest highlights and all the news,"The second keynote of Build 2017 didn't disappoint when it came to big announcements, with seemingly something for everyone.

Whether another update coming to Windows 10, its accompanying features, cross-platform collaborations, a Mixed Reality accessory and a whole new design language, Microsoft gave us plenty to digest as it put a bow on Build.

Read on for the biggest moments of Day 2, and jump to the next page to catch up on everything that happened on Day 1.

Windows 10 Fall Creators Update

Microsoft is releasing another update to its Windows 10 operating system later this year, and it's appropriately called the Fall Creators Update.

Within the update are several new features, some of which we'll dive into in just a little bit. Much of the update centers around a new design language, a unified and responsive experience for users, new applications, and letting users work quickly and seamlessly from any device, whether Windows, iOS and Android.

A big part of the Fall Creators Update is a new design language for developers, called the Fluent Design System. This will essentially allow for responsive, unified apps, experiences and interactions within Windows 10. Developers can create ""more expressive and engaging apps,"" Microsoft says, and one of its most important features is that it fosters harmony across devices and platforms.

In other words, no more using an app that looks a certain way on one device only to find it's completely different on another device - a jarring experience, to say the least.

Fluent Design also aims to improve input diversity, letting users interact with their machines using touch, pen, voice, gestures and even eye control.

The simplest way to think of Fluent Design is that it will allow for harmonious and responsive cross-device experiences, which should be a boon for developers and users alike.

New Fall Creators Update apps and features

New applications and features are of course an important part of the Windows Fall Creators Update. Here are the standouts Microsoft detailed today:

Windows Story Remix is a creative app that lets users edit their photos and videos, adding everything from filters to music to 3D augmented reality objects.

The app can stitch together photos and videos from different sources to create one video, and can intelligently identify people in an image of clip. The whole idea is to help users create shareable moments, tapping into the creative tools Microsoft and others bring to the application.

The Timeline feature in the Fall Creators Update will let users retrace their steps to whatever they were doing last, such as recently accessed files, apps and websites they want to pull up again without starting from scratch. A visual timeline lets users see what they've done and select where they want to go. Think of it like macOS' Time Machine, but for hopping back to whatever was last on your desktop.

Along the same lines is the Pick Up Were You Left Off feature (Microsoft may want to shorten the name). Using Cortana, users can move activities across Windows, iOS and Android devices seamlessly, such as starting a doc on a Windows PC and picking it up on their Android phone.

Clipboard elicited a buzz from the Build crowd when announced. It basically lets users copy text from one device and paste it onto a phone, no matter who that phone is made by. Microsoft gave the example of copying the name of a business from a PC and pasting it into Google Maps on a Samsung Galaxy S8, to give you an idea.

Last but not least is OneDrive Files on Demand, a feature that lets you access any file you have stored in the cloud without downloading it. This will be great for saving space on your devices as well as collaborative projects. All changes made in the cloud will appear the next time you pull up a file. OneDrive Files on Demand will head to preview versions of Windows 10 in early summer.

iTunes is coming to the Windows Store

If you need to re-read that, we understand. No one in the Build crowd seemed to anticipate that iTunes is coming to Microsoft's digital marketplace, but as Terry Myerson revealed on stage, it's indeed true.

Apple's iTunes will arrive later this year, giving Windows users access to all it has to offer, including Apple Music.

While PC owners could already download iTunes from Apple directly, this marks the first time the service will be available right in the Windows Store.

This is a huge get for Microsoft's marketplace as it's notorious for having poor app selection. It's also a sign of Microsoft's embrace of competing platforms and services, a big change of course for the company.

Microsoft's Mixed Reality motion controllers

The one bit of new hardware Microsoft unveiled at Build are its own Mixed Reality motion controllers, designed for the suite of Windows Mixed Reality headsets on the way from various partners.

What really sets the controllers apart is that they don't require trackers positioned throughout a room, as you need with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive controllers to create a sense of room scale.

Instead, Microsoft's controllers rely on sensors inside the Mixed Reality headsets to track motion and pick up commands, meaning not only is there no extra installation, but you don't have to pay for any sensors.

What's more, this could make the whole system more portable as you don't need sensors set up anyone's house in order to use them.

The best bit of news is how affordable the controllers appear to be: though we don't know how much they cost on their own, Acer's Mixed Reality headset is getting bundled with the controllers for just $399, going on sale this holiday. That's significantly cheaper than what you'll find from Oculus or HTC.

Developers can pre-order Windows Mixed Reality headsets starting today

Microsoft is certainly moving the mixed reality ball forward, and its hardware partners are right along side.

It was revealed today that the developers in the US and Canada can pre-order Acer and HP's Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition headsets starting today from the Microsoft Store, and the devices will be delivered later this summer. Acer's headset is priced at $299 while HP's design is $329.

Though a shame you can't buy these headsets yet, it does mean developers get a chance to start working on Mixed Reality applications and other content before the headsets become available to consumers. This is how Oculus Rift released, and it's a smart play by Microsoft.

10,Prey review,"In Arkane’s smart and stylish revival of the 2006 first-person shooter, the moon-orbiting Talos 1 space station is being overrun by Typhon, a shape-shifting collective of aliens. It’s up to your character, Morgan Yu, to fight back by any means necessary. However, your goal is just as much about finding a motive worth fighting for.



Is there anyone left to save? Can I actually make a difference? And why am I in the middle of it all? These are all questions that you’ll answer with your actions, or at least try to, throughout the roughly 20 hour campaign.



For some gamers, a gun in-hand is reason enough to truck through to the game’s end. Prey is an action game, after all, so it wastes little time rolling out a pistol, wrench and shotgun, as well as a few other futuristic weapons, like the GLOO gun that freezes enemies in their tracks.



But if you’re looking for more depth in your FPS games, it’s not too difficult to find it here. Prey features a large skill tree filled with fun, upgradeable abilities that will make your trek feel dynamic and fresh, no matter your style of play.



Mixed in with the balance gunplay and supernatural abilities, players can further mix up their strategy by crafting items to build up your offense against the Typhon.



Unlike games like Arkane’s own Dishonored, and BioShock, you aren’t delivered an ending based on your level of violence or lack thereof. The multiple endings hinge on some big decisions you make throughout the story, both in the main quest and in how you handle many of its sidequests.



While Prey is a solid offering on almost all accounts, it misses the mark in a few areas. While performance on the PC was rock-solid, the clumsy melee combat controls never really seem to jive with the hectic movement of the Typhon creatures. And its story, which concludes majestically, takes a little too long to find its groove and misses a beat from time to time.

Talos 1 is so detail-packed that you’ll probably want to squeeze every drip out of it, but the game frustratingly steps on its own toes at times. For example, it’s all too easy to become overwhelmed with quest objectives that have you zipping around the environment faster than you can memorize its layout.



Also, character dialogue will sometimes overlap with audio logs, which essentially makes you miss out on two potentially important bits of story at once and is a little immersion-breaking for the serious atmosphere that Arkane has made.



All said, if you’re a fan of FPS games and enjoy a sci-fi setting, Prey is a must-play. But for the more discerning player, those few minor flaws might stand in your way of total enjoyment.

The tale on Talos 1

Prey is, more or less, an open-world game. As you explore Talos 1 on foot (and outside of it in glorious microgravity), you’ll come across new quests to take on and be treated to many bits of environmental storytelling and collectable lore in the form of notes and audio logs.



If you look and listen closely, you’ll notice the excellent narrative details put into the game, which paints a humanizing (or sometimes, dehumanizing) picture of life on the space station just before, and as, shit hit the fan with the Typhon invasion.

Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6

Prey has many layers to its narrative, but mostly leaves it up to you to peel them all back. It’s a shame that some of its more memorable beats are hidden away, but at least it gives you all the more reason to go back through the journey a second time.



Speaking on the bigger moments in the story that you can’t help but see play out in front of you, many of them unfold exactly as you’d expect. Thankfully, a few big curve balls tossed in along the way really help to avoid being fatigued by familiarity.

Attack and release

A few things are made very clear from the start of the game: you are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the Typhon.



Ranging from the small, Half-Life headcrab-like Mimics, to the intimidating bipedal Phantoms (and a few others that I won’t spoil for you), the struggle is made just a little more bearable by knowing each enemy’s weakness, discoverable by scanning it with the Psychoscope a la Metroid Prime.



Equipped with this intel, finding the ideal mix and match of assault combos for each enemy type is endlessly satisfying. For most of the beasts, applying some motion-freezing GLOO, followed by some wrench action yields decent results. At best, you’ll lose little health and waste almost no resources in the process.

Speaking of resources, Prey features a robust inventory management system that’s actually a lot of fun to use. The remains of slain Typhon, as well as other scraps and abandoned tech can be salvaged for raw materials for use in crafting items like ammo, medkits and other things that are rare to come by during play, especially in the game’s tough later sections.



That said, there certainly are some encounters that call for the boomstick. And even though you aren’t punished for brute forcing your way through the game, the style of play that yielded the best results involved taking a moment to consider how each battle would affect my resources on hand. There’s nothing that I love more than saying hello to a Phantom with a loud gun, but in most cases (as I fail to illustrate below) I valued having a fat stack of reserve materials a little more.

The power of choice

Neuromods also help you even-out the fight against the Typhon. Shortly after you begin the journey, Morgan can learn new perks with these collectable items that can be used to unlock new abilities and upgrades to your suit’s capabilities.



Want to boost your strength, hack terminals and double your health gauge? Enjoy being stealthy? There’s a perk for that. Additionally, there are chipsets sprinkled throughout the campaign that give your suit some specialized powers, like the ability to see hidden mimics and granting you higher chances of landing critical blows with your favorite weapon, and more.

As such, the skill tree presented here allows for surprisingly deep customization, even allowing Morgan to take on certain traits of the Typhon to gain a considerable edge in combat. Abilities like shape-shifting, teleporting and mind-hacking really broaden the playbook when they become available around halfway through the journey. However, there are some interesting implications at stake for adopting the enemy’s ways.

To hunt and to be hunted

I have a confession to make: it took me a while to not suck at Prey. A common scenario involved being ambushed by a lowly Mimic while it was disguised as a mug. Effortlessly juking around the room, it avoided my every swing of a wrench. Having drained all of my stamina, I realize that I am the prey, owned by the easiest enemy in the game.



While I did become more proficient later on, the wild enemy patterns are tougher to read than they seem. To that end, I appreciate that this game enforces learning through failures and plotting out your attack, even when it’s just a casual encounter with a relatively harmless enemy.



In the end, the harsh, but fair difficulty made applying learned battle tactics to each Typhon encounter during my bleak tenure on Talos 1 one of the more rewarding things I’ve done in a game this year.



Prey is a captivating exploration of how far humans will go to sustain their species, even at the cost of their own lives or others. While it suffers from poor pacing at times and a few quality of life issues, this game more than makes up for it with surprising depth in its story, an incredible atmosphere and an open-ended approach that caters to casual and more hardcore gamers alike.

Arkane has crafted one of my favorite experiences of 2017.

Verdict: Play it now

Prey was reviewed on the PC with code provided by Bethesda.

TechRadar's review system scores games as 'Don't Play It', 'Play It' and 'Play It Now', the last of which is the highest score we can give. A 'Play It' score suggests a solid game with some flaws, but the written review will reveal the exact justifications.",techradar

6,Senate gives bipartisan backing to Trump's nominee for U.S. trade representative,"Robert Lighthizer speaks at the Senate Finance Committee hearing on his nomination to be U.S trade representative on March 14, 2017. (Photo: Tasos Katopodis, AFP/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump's nominee for U.S. trade representative on a bipartisan vote despite complaints from some Republicans that the administration has an ""ongoing, incoherent and inconsistent trade message.""

The Senate voted 82-14 to confirm Robert Lighthizer, who served as deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan and has worked on trade issues as a lawyer representing various manufacturers and high-tech companies.

Lighthizer will take his cues from a president who has broken with most Republicans in his criticism of free-trade agreements and who has spread the work on trade policy beyond the office of the United States Trade Representative.

Two Republican senators said late Wednesday they would oppose Lighthizer. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska said in a two-page letter to Lighthizer that his confirmation process had failed to reassure them he understands the economic benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

""Beyond your vocal advocacy for protectionist shifts in our trade policies, the administration's ongoing, incoherent and inconsistent trade message has compounded our concern,"" they wrote.

The senators said they doubted that Lighthizer would champion agriculture and negotiate trade deals to the benefit of American consumers and the economy.

Trump nearly bailed on NAFTA. He repeatedly derided the 1994 pact during the campaign as the worst trade deal ever and mocked his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, for her support for the agreement. President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.

McCain and Sasse said Lighthizer has made his skepticism of NAFTA well-known, ""which we find to be alarming.""

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he told Lighthizer there are definitely opportunities to update and improve NAFTA.

""But it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic oath: First do no harm,"" Hatch said in endorsing Lighthizer before the vote.

Some of Lighthizer's strongest support came from Democratic lawmakers.

Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said Lighthizer not only understands how the global trading system works, but also how it sometimes breaks down. Still, Wyden complained that he wanted to get more clarity about the administration's trade agenda, saying it's clear that different factions in the administration have opposing agendas on trade issues.

""So far, this administration's trade strategy amounts to a muddle of 140-character tweets, mixed messages and overhyped announcements that are backed by little substance,"" Wyden said.

Lighthizer has criticized some Republicans for being too pro-free trade. He told a Senate panel this year that the U.S. should have an ""America first trade policy.""

""We can do better in negotiating our trade agreements and stronger in enforcing our trade laws,"" he said.

Trump's tough talk on trade has drawn support from states with a large percentage of manufacturing workers. But some farm groups are worried about how withdrawing from an Asia-Pacific trade deal and reworking other trade pacts could hurt sales of U.S.-produced beef, poultry and grains.

To help address that concern, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Thursday created a top post within the department to oversee trade and foreign agricultural affairs.

9,Dana White sets deadline for Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather negotiations | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White is ready to either get the deal done for Conor McGregor to face off with Floyd Mayweather or he’s walking away from the negotiating table all together.

White has stated for weeks that he was going to do everything in his power to get the fight done that would see the current UFC lightweight champion likely pocket a paycheck that could potentially exceed $75 million for the matchup with Mayweather.

According to White, his plan was to sit down with McGregor following the birth of his child, which took place last weekend, and now it appears he plans on speaking to the Irish fighter on Sunday to hammer out a deal.

White told Jim Rome on Thursday that he’s hoping to wrap up McGregor’s part of the negotiations on Sunday before then moving onto deal with Mayweather’s camp starting on Monday.

“I plan on having this thing locked up by this Sunday and then moving on to Team Mayweather and starting a negotiation with them. If we really do get it done in that time frame, then this thing could possibly happen,” White said.

“But again, I still need to go negotiate with [Floyd Mayweather’s team]. There’s no guarantee that we’re going to come to a deal.”

Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

The flipside is White also stating that if he can’t reach an agreement with McGregor on financial terms on Sunday then he’s calling a stop to the negotiations and moving on from the fight all together.

White said Sunday is “absolutely” his deadline to get a deal done with McGregor but he’s feeling “pretty good” about coming to an agreement with the UFC lightweight champion.

“Hopefully Monday I’m going to sit down to negotiate with Team Mayweather,” White teased.

McGregor and Mayweather have been flirting with this matchup for more than a year, but it appeared in recent months that the fight was actually going to come together.

The sticking point has always been the financial stakes for McGregor and Mayweather with both fighters claiming to be the larger draw in the matchup, which would mean a bigger piece of the lucrative pay-per-view pie that would undoubtedly earn a ton of money.

White promised McGregor that he would do everything in his power to get the deal done but the sand in the hourglass is nearly running out with the UFC president setting a deadline when he’s walking away from the table.

By all accounts it appears White will know by Monday if he’s one step closer towards making the fight a reality or putting a nail in the coffin for this long rumored matchup once and for all.

“Yeah I just can’t keep messing with this thing,” White said. “I need to run my business and I have to focus on all the other things that are going on around here.”",fox-sports
16,3 smart business ideas for Millennials in 2017,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Millennials in the United States have a different set of values on social and economic topics than the generations before them, according to a new report from the U.S. Census Bureau Time

Millennials face financial barriers when trying to start a business, including higher student loan debt and lower starting wages than previous generations. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Millennials face financial barriers when trying to start a business, including higher student loan debt and lower starting wages than previous generations.

These challenges, cited in a 2016 survey by business services firm EY and policy organization Economic Innovation Group, are making it difficult for young people to become entrepreneurs.

Less than 2% of Millennials were self-employed as of 2014, compared with 7.6% for Generation X and 8.3% for baby boomers, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.

But entrepreneurship is still possible for Millennials, defined in this article as adults under 35: Here are three smart business ideas that match up well with the skills, interests and passions of many in this generation — along with the experiences of a few who have used them successfully.

1. Social media coaching or training

Social media is second nature to Millennials: 88% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 used Facebook every day in 2016, compared with 62% of those over the age of 65, according to a Pew Research Center study.

Social-media-savvy Millennials can turn those skills into a business teaching small businesses and others how to use digital tools to stay relevant in the marketplace.

Success story: Tracy Samantha Schmidt, 32, is a social media educator and digital marketing consultant. She says social media coaching is a low-cost, potentially lucrative business idea because it can lead to other opportunities in digital marketing.

“[Clients] may realize they need an email marketing person, a web designer, a blogger, a copywriter,” says Schmidt, a former journalist.

For social media coaching, a reasonable rate to charge is $50 an hour to start, according to Schmidt. “I know a lot of people who go for that rate,” she says. “Executives are willing to pay up to $200 per hour, but they’re going to want someone who’s done it for corporations and has credibility.” The amount you get may depend on the market where you live.

2. Nonprofit organization

Starting a nonprofit could be a good match for a socially conscious Millennial: 88% of Millennials say a job is more fulfilling if they can make a positive impact on social and environmental issues, according to a 2016 study by Cone Communications, a public relations and marketing agency.

While a nonprofit fulfills a social mission, it’s also important to operate it as a business and diversify sources of income, says Sarah LaFave, 28, a registered nurse who co-founded Lori’s Hands, which connects college student volunteers to people living with chronic illnesses in Newark, Del. She named the nonprofit after her mother, who died from breast cancer while LaFave was a high school freshman.

“We spend a lot of time thinking of new and creative ways to bring in funds so we’re never depending on a single source,” LaFave says.

Success story: Growing up working for his family’s moving company in New Jersey, Adam Lowy, 31, was bothered to learn that so much nonperishable food gets thrown away during a move. After donating to his local food bank, he learned that thousands in his county didn’t have enough to eat.

That experience led Lowy to start Move for Hunger, which works with moving companies to donate unwanted nonperishable food. It has delivered over 7 million pounds of consumables to food banks across North America since 2009.

“I feel like I’ve been able to make a difference in people’s lives, and to me that’s way more rewarding than any paycheck,” Lowy says.

Identify a problem and come up with a solution the market has yet to find, just like you would try to do with a for-profit business, he says.

3. Subscription-based product or service

Millennials love their subscription services: 70% own a product subscription, such as Birchbox or Dollar Shave Club, while 89% own a service subscription, such as Netflix or Spotify. That’s more than any other generation, according to a 2017 study by payments processor Vantiv.

Young entrepreneurs can tap into the demand for subscription services to launch a business.

Success story: Ryan Perlowin, 29, is the founder and CEO of My Happy Plates, which delivers customized weekly meal plans and recipes via email. The subscription-service business model carries benefits for both entrepreneurs and customers, he says.

Many subscription services (My Happy Plates included) offer free trials, so customers can try them out and cancel at any time.

You can validate a business idea much faster and cheaper, and get valuable feedback from customers to incorporate into product changes, he says.

“Get a basic version of your product going without spending much time or money, and see if people adopt it,” he says. “If the problem is there, and you can validate that this is a real problem that you’re solving, you have to go for it.”

On what should be a momentous day for his five-year-old syndicated talk show, Steve Harvey is dealing with a leaked memo in which he reportedly told staff not to speak to or approach him.

Thursday marks The Steve Harvey Show's last taping at its home at Chicago's NBC Tower before moving west to Los Angeles. When it returns this fall for Season 6, it will have a shortened title, Steve, and more celebrity guests. And thanks to a deal struck last year with NBC Universal and IMG, Harvey will have an ownership stake and more control.

Harvey, 60, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he did send the staff memo that was leaked to Chicago media blog RobertFeder.com and picked up by Variety and Deadline.com.

In the email, sent to Steve Harvey Show employees as they returned to work last fall, he laid out new rules banning staffers from ""popping into"" his dressing room or the makeup room to see him or approaching him in the hallway in hopes of having a walk-and-talk meeting.

""Do not approach me while I’m in the makeup chair unless I ask to speak with you directly,"" he instructed them, saying they should knock or ring the doorbell before barging in.

""I want all the ambushing to stop now,"" he wrote. ""That includes TV staff. You must schedule an appointment. I have been taken advantage of by my lenient policy in the past. This ends now. NO MORE.""

He warned would-be violators, ""If you open my door, expect to be removed,"" adding that his security guards would be stationed outside his dressing room to turn away uninvited visitors.

Harvey stressed throughout the memo that he felt he had to make changes in order to keep his work days from being eaten up by impromptu meetings and glad-handing backstage visitors. ""It is for the good of my personal life and enjoyment,"" he explained, asking them not to take offense.

He asked critics to put themselves in his shoes, noting, ""If you come out your house, you don't want anybody on your porch waiting on you. You walk to your car, you don't want people bothering you on your way to your car. Everybody wants the freedom to be able to move around.""

Later, he described the daily interruptions to ET: ""Look, man, I'm in my makeup chair, they walk in the room. I'm having lunch, they walk in, they don't knock,"" he continued. ""I'm in the hallway, I'm getting ambushed by people with friends that come to the show and having me sign this and do this.""

While he won't apologize for the memo's overall message, he admits, ""In hindsight, I probably should've handled it a little bit differently.""

It's worth noting that the talk show isn't the only project occupying Harvey's days. He hosts two other programs, NBC's Little Big Shots and ABC's updated Family Feud as well as a radio show, rivaling Ryan Seacrest for having the most jobs in showbiz.

It's possible the memo was leaked by one of the dozens of Harvey staffers who were not invited to move west to work on the revamped show and are now out of work.

In the last year, Harvey has come under fire for making fun of Asian men on his show as well as meeting with then President-elect Donald Trump and his HUD nominee, Dr. Ben Carson, to discuss ideas for inner-city programs during the transition.

""Our president (Obama) asked that all of us sit down and talk to one another in order to move our country forward,"" the host of Family Feud and The Steve Harvey Show noted in a statement posted to Twitter in mid-January. ""The transition teams on both sides asked me to meet and I'm glad I did.""

Harvey also reached meme status last year when he announced the wrong winner at the end of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant, a blunder he was reminded of many times during the 2016 pageant and that is likely to end up in his obituary. But he's learned to have a sense of humor about it.

After a similar snafu happened during the presentation of this year's best-picture Oscar, he extended an offer to presenter Warren Beatty: ""Call me. I can help you get through this.""

9,Predictions for every fight on the UFC 211: Miocic vs. Dos Santos 2 main card | FOX Sports,"Joanna Jedrzejczyk vs. Jessica Andrade

UFC strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk faces what looks to be her toughest opponent to date when she battles former bantamweight contender Jessica Andrade.

Andrade is a rare mix of power and speed, and she’s been a huge problem for strawweights since dropping to the division in 2016. Jedrzejczyk has simply overwhelmed opponents with her volume on the feet, landing over 125 significant strikes in all four of her title defenses. But that fact shouldn’t worry Andrade, who has twice cracked the 100 significant strike threshold during her three fight winning streak at 115-pounds.

The key for Andrade in this bout will be her ability to close the distance against the taller and longer Jedrzejczyk. Joanna Champion isn’t known for her shifty footwork but she should be able to touch Andrade with her long jab enough to make the Brazilian think twice about rushing in with combinations.

It appears Jedrzejczyk has sown up the ground game issues that plagued her in her first fight against Claudia Gadelha, where she was planted seven times, but the threat of the takedown will still be there against the powerful Andrade, who has shown she can pull off a submission if the opportunity presents itself.

However, all signs point to this bout being fought predominantly in the stand-up, and a war of attrition bodes well for Jedrzejczyk, who has fought a full five rounds three times in her UFC career compared to none for Andrade. And I think that’s how the fight will be won -- Jedrzejczyk dragging Andrade into the championship rounds and pulling away with her world-class stamina that allows her to be just as effective in the fifth round as she is at the opening bell.",fox-sports
6,Here's a timeline leading up to James Comey's firing and the fallout it unleashed,"(CNN) FBI Director James Comey was fired abruptly Tuesday by President Donald Trump, and the White House has scrambled since then to explain how Trump reached his decision.

Here's a look at what led to Comey's firing and what's happened in the aftermath:

May 2

Hillary Clinton says she was on her way to winning the presidency until the FBI director wrote a letter to Congress saying he was reopening the investigation into her use of a private email server 11 days before the November 8 election.

Trump tweets a response that night: ""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!""

Comey, testifying before senators in a committee hearing, says he's ""mildly nauseous"" at the idea he influenced the election when he reopened the Clinton email investigation. Still, he defended his decision to do so.

At the time, Trump said that Comey's decision ""took guts"" and that the FBI chief ""brought back his reputation"" by reopening the investigation.

In his testimony, Comey says he publicly announced his conclusions in the Clinton email investigation after deciding the Justice Department's credibility had been affected by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch's airport tarmac meeting with former President Bill Clinton.

Comey adds the Russians are still meddling in US politics because they may have concluded, ""This works.""

At the daily press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer says Trump ""has confidence"" in Comey.

That evening, Spicer, sandwiched between reporters and a large shrub in the White House driveway, says Trump arrived at his decision after receiving the memo from Rosenstein that day.

CNN reports that federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas to associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the election. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before Comey's firing.

6,Timeline: Trump's words contradict White House answers on Comey firing,"Trump told NBC News on Thursday that he was going to fire Comey with or without Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's memo criticizing the director.

That statement contradicts at least 10 times Trump's top aides and advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, tried to explain the how and the why the President decided to sack Comey. Tuesday's unceremonious move came amid the FBI's probe into Russia's role in the 2016 election and any connections the Trump campaign had to the hackers.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump told NBC. He added: ""(Rosenstein) made a recommendation ... He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.""

That was not the story Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

""President Trump made the right decision at the right time to accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General,"" Pence said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said her answers ""went off that information that I had when I answered your question.""

At the time, she said, she ""hadn't had a chance"" to ask the President directly, despite having numerous conversations with him. Sanders also claimed the White House story had been ""consistent,"" despite the clear inconsistencies.

Washington (CNN) The White House says President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey because of his treatment of Hillary Clinton. But there's mounting evidence it also had something to do with the continuing investigation by the FBI into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia.

CNN's Jake Tapper has reported a source close to Comey says the now-former director never offered his loyalty to President and that the pace of the investigation into alleged Russian connections to the Trump campaign was actually quickening.

We might never know what was going through Trump's mind when he took the unprecedented step.

But we do know for sure that Comey twice embarrassed the President while testifying in front of Congress by directly undercutting something Trump had been pushing.

6,ICE announces major anti-gang operation,"Story highlights Three of the arrests were former DACA recipients

Arrests included mostly US citizens

Washington (CNN) Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced its largest anti-gang operation ever on Thursday, a six-week operation that netted more than 1,300 arrests nationwide.

Though the effort was led by ICE, the focus was not exclusively on immigrants. Of the arrests, 933 were US citizens and 445 were foreign nationals, with 384 in the country illegally.

ICE said three of the arrested individuals were previous recipients of protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, instituted by the Obama administration for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.

Criminal violations or being deemed a public safety threat can void a person's DACA status.

ICE also noted that 10 of the arrests were of people who crossed the border as unaccompanied minors, eight of whom were confirmed to belong to the MS-13 gang , ICE said. Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, is strongest in Central America, especially El Salvador, but extends its criminal enterprise across the US, including cities like Los Angeles, New York and the Washington region.

9,Manchester United 1-1 Celta Vigo (2-1 agg),"Marouane Fellaini heads home United's goal

Manchester United survived a huge late scare to edge past Spanish visitors Celta Vigo and set up a Europa League final against Dutch giants Ajax.

Leading 1-0 from the first leg, United took control as Marouane Fellaini headed home Marcus Rashford's cross.

But Celta, needing two goals, levelled on the night through Facundo Roncaglia to set up a tense final few minutes.

United's Eric Bailly and Roncaglia were sent off after a mass brawl, and the hosts hung on to reach the final.

Indeed they could only celebrate after Celta striker John Guidetti scuffed a golden chance to put the visitors through to their first major European final with the final kick of the game.

The aggregate victory took the Red Devils a step closer to their first Europa League triumph and a return to the Champions League.

They will meet Ajax, who beat Lyon in the other semi-final, in Stockholm on 24 May.

Relive a tense night at Old Trafford

There were just six seconds left when Guidetti missed the chance to put Celta through

Functional not flashy - but in the final

United had never lost a two-legged European tie after winning the first leg away from home, and knew they would reach the final by keeping a clean sheet at an expectant Old Trafford.

The hosts looked nervy as Celta made an attacking start, before Fellaini settled the tension by converting his side's first effort on target.

The Belgium midfielder sneaked in at the far post to powerfully head in Rashford's clipped right-wing cross.

Jose Mourinho's side created few other chances as they aimed to frustrate the visitors with an organised and largely defensive approach.

Although Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Rashford and Fellaini all drew saves from Celta keeper Sergio Alvarez after the break, it was a functional - not flashy - performance.

Celta, who had lost their previous five matches and are 12th in La Liga, had more possession than the home side, and forced United keeper Sergio Romero into instinctive saves at the start of each half.

They then ignited the tie with Roncaglia's glancing header following a corner.

The away goal, which left them needing one more to eliminate United, increased the tension inside Old Trafford, leading to a scuffle involving almost all 22 players on the field.

Bailly was sent off for a swipe at former Manchester City striker Guidetti, with Roncaglia dismissed for retaliating.

With six minutes of added time, there was still opportunity for Celta to create one final chance - but Guidetti blew it.

While United's players greeted the final whistle with a mixture of relief and jubilation, the visitors slumped to the turf with Guidetti in tears.

""You cannot win a semi-final easily, or be calm. We are in the final, that's what counts,"" said United midfielder Ander Herrera.

United defender Bailly (second left) will miss the final after his red card

Europa League or bust for Mourinho

Winning the Europa League has become Mourinho's priority as he looks to secure a return to the Champions League in his debut season at Old Trafford.

And the campaign will be deemed a disappointing one if his team lose to Ajax, who edged out Lyon 5-4 on aggregate.

Expectations were high that Mourinho's arrival would bring an end to the malaise that has surrounded the Red Devils since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.

United have finished seventh, fourth and fifth in the three Premier League seasons since the Scot's departure - and Mourinho arrived with loftier ambitions than simply scraping into the top four.

Ten months later, the Portuguese has been forced to drastically reassess his ambitions.

He appears to have conceded defeat in the top-four race, with his team sixth, four points adrift of Manchester City going into their final three matches.

With the return leg against Celta at the forefront of his mind, Mourinho made eight changes for Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal - a clear admission he felt winning the Europa League was more attainable than breaking into the top four.

However, his decision will only be justified if they are successful in beating Ajax and claiming their sixth European trophy.

The missing piece in the jigsaw

The Red Devils have won 65 trophies in their illustrious 115-year history, a figure including 20 English league titles and three European Cup/Champions League victories.

However, there is one piece of silverware missing from the Old Trafford trophy room.

Winning the Europa League, or its predecessor the Uefa Cup, may have been considered an unwanted honour in previous Red Devils eras.

Now it is considered a must-win as the club looks to complete a clean sweep of the major competitions at home and abroad.

The front cover of Thursday's matchday programme creatively illustrated how United hope to complete a clean sweep

Analysis

Former England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live:

""They are not the most technical Man Utd team I've ever seen. Mourinho is very good at setting a team up but it is not entertaining.

""United have always been entertainers and even if they win the Europa League, people will say: 'Yes they won it, but it wasn't entertaining.'

""The goal for Celta came from United's lack of concentration and it became a little bit ""panic stations"" for the rest of the match.

""Ajax are a young team - they could easily freeze in that final.""

Post-match reaction

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:

""We were the best team in the first leg but we never kill, we never score goals related to the chances we have. It was an open game at home, all the pressure on our side.

""They were completely free of responsibility and gave us a very hard match. We suffered until the end and it was open until the last second. The boys gave everything they had. I'm really pleased for them.

""After 14 matches, we are in the final. If we win the Europa League, I am more than happy. It would be amazing.""",bbc-news
6,Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein to be invited to brief Senate on Comey's firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be invited to an all-senators briefing next week to discuss his role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office confirmed Thursday that he is working on scheduling the meeting.

“Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has been meeting with members and has made himself available to the leadership as well,"" said Don Stewart, the Kentucky Republican's spokesman. ""So the Leader is working on scheduling a briefing for members from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Once we have more information we’ll be sure to make an announcement.”

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who had been calling for the meeting, tweeted the invitation is ""a good first step & I thank him.""

Democrats have been calling on Rosenstein to start answering questions about his role in the firing, saying his “apolitical” reputation is on the line.

Schumer asked Rosenstein more than two dozen questions in a letter Thursday, including whether Comey had asked last week for additional resources for the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Both Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recommended Comey’s dismissal to President Trump, though Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt on Thursday he would have fired Comey regardless.

Schumer wrote that there is wide skepticism that the justifications Rosenstein laid out in a memo to Sessions are the “real basis” for Trump’s decision. He asked whether Trump directed Rosenstein to write the memo, citing Comey’s handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. He requested answers by May 15.

“This skepticism, and indeed all of the circumstances surrounding Director Comey’s dismissal just as he was leading an investigation into the Trump administration’s and Trump campaign’s ties with Russia and President Putin’s interference with the 2016 election, have shaken public confidence in the Department, in your leadership, and in the administration of law and justice in our country,” Schumer wrote. “In order to restore the nation’s faith in you personally and in our law enforcement system more broadly, the American people must understand more about your role in the president’s firing of Director Comey.”

Schumer’s letter foreshadows the grilling Rosenstein would get if he appears at an all-senators briefing.

Rosenstein was in the Capitol on Thursday for a closed-door meeting with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

Democratic leaders on the Senate Appropriations Committee also sought information Thursday from Rosenstein on whether Comey requested additional resources before Trump fired him.

“The American people have a right to know, for the sake of our national security and sovereignty, whether and to what extent Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election,” wrote Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee’s highest-ranking Democrat, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee overseeing Justice Department spending. “Given the importance of this investigation, the FBI and the DOJ should spare no expense in getting to the truth.”

Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned Trump’s motives in firing Comey, but Republican leaders defended his decision.

While Democrats worked to keep the issue in the spotlight Thursday, they didn’t repeat Wednesday’s tactics to slow Senate business so that acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe could testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in Comey’s place. Comey has been invited to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

Schumer, in his Senate floor speech, continued to demand the appointment of a special prosecutor by a non-political appointee of the Justice Department. He called for Comey to testify before Congress. And he called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to hold separate, all-senators briefings with Sessions and Rosenstein that may be classified.

Schumer noted 94 senators voted last month for Rosenstein’s confirmation, but he said many now question their belief in his “reputation for integrity” and assurances that he would be “an independent force” inside the department.

“He owes it to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him, to provide some answers,” Schumer said.

16,'Big Bang Theory' still booming as cliffhanger closes Season 10,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share In this exclusive clip from the Season 10 finale, one of Sheldon's former admirers returns while Amy is away for the summer. That has his friends worried. WARNER BROS.

Just as cast, producers and CBS have come together for two more seasons of The Big Bang Theory, a separation poses a major test for Sheldon and Amy in Thursday’s Season 10 finale (8 ET/PT).

Caltech physicist Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who baby-stepped into a live-in arrangement with Amy (Mayim Bialik) at the start of the season, now must adjust to her being across the country, on a fellowship at Princeton.

Co-creator Chuck Lorre says the growth of that relationship and others – resulting in breakups, marriages and a baby -- is a key to the success of Bang (averaging 18.7 million viewers), which will outlast NBC hits Friends, Cheers and Frasier with its two-season extension. (Its ratings strength as TV's top comedy also has spawned a fall CBS prequel, Young Sheldon.)

“The best way to explore a character is to put that character into a relationship,” says Lorre. ""We started with these (brilliant scientists) who were extremely stunted in terms of their ability to connect with other human beings, especially women. And look where we are now. It's kind of mind-boggling.""

'The Big Bang Theory' gang is almost all there in the Season 10 finale, as Amy is in Princeton on a fellowship. (Photo: Michael Yarish, Warner Bros. Entertainment)

Parsons says Sheldon and Amy's move across the hall has forced him to relearn his footwork.

“I’m still adjusting to living in Penny’s apartment. Every once in a while, we're coming up the stairs and it's a nearly 10-year-old habit of turning toward the door of"" the old apartment, where spouses Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny (Kaley Cuoco) now live.

With Amy temporarily gone, Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), an admiring grad student from Season 2, returns to make a romantic overture to Sheldon. Naïve as ever, he's oblivious, but Penny, Leonard and the gang worry about its effect on his relationship with Amy.

The slow-and-steady development of the characters — Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Raj (Kunal Nayyar), at the start, with Amy and Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) arriving in Season 3 — has added comedy and a little heart, says executive producer Steven Molaro.

""In the very first episode, Leonard decides he loves Penny, and that has played out. Look at Wolowitz and how he's grown. When we met Raj, he couldn't speak if a girl was in the room. And the thought of Sheldon having a girlfriend seemed ridiculous in Season 3,"" says Molaro.

Although such changes can be acts of ratings desperation by long-running shows, Parsons sees the situation differently.

""They introduced (Amy and Bernadette) at a time well before anyone felt it was 'needed,'"" he says. ""It worked out beautifully, It's the same thing with life-changing storylines. I've never felt they were done at a time when we we were starving for something. Instead, it's done early enough that, as a cast, we go, 'Oof! Why?' Time after time, a year later, I'm saying, 'I'm so glad we did that..' ""

Bang is spawning an even bigger change withYoung Sheldon, which focuses on the genius's Texas upbringing and features a new cast and no studio audience.

Parsons will narrate the series, set to air this fall right after Big Bang. ""It's more of an origins story than a close cousin to Big Bang,"" he says. ""It's more like the beginnings of a superhero, which in this case is a genius nerdy kid.""

As that show blazes a new path, Lorre acknowledges the challenge of coming up with plots for Bang's 11th season. But ""I've had concerns (whether) there are enough stories since the pilot, and somehow we just finished shooting our 231st episode.""

6,Comey firing adds to GOP's load of political liabilities for midterms,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

WASHINGTON — A coalition of two progressive groups will launch a paid advertising campaign on Friday targeting eight moderate Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, demanding an independent investigation into whether President Trump colluded with Russia to influence the U.S. election. It's among the signs that Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey could have immediate political repercussions for his party.

Democrats in Congress have little leverage to force an independent commission or the appointment of a special counsel. Yet much like outside progressive groups organized around the unpopular House health care bill, they may have the power to make Russia a second major political liability for GOP lawmakers hesitant to back an independent commission or special prosecutor to investigate Trump’s potential ties to Russia. The groups, End Citizens United and Every Voice, say the campaign will be ongoing and they may expand their targets to additional Republicans. The campaign will also include polling and grassroots actions.

Town halls are another example of how quickly the issue is becoming a flash point for Republicans. They include forums this week by Rep. David Brat of Virginia and Rep. Tom MacArthur’s contentious town hall in New Jersey in which Russia and health care dominated the two-hour forum.

Finally, in Virginia, former Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat running for governor, wasted less than 24 hours in targeting his Republican competitor over the Comey firing. The Republican, Ed Gillespie, hasn’t spoken out on Comey’s sudden dismissal this week after he reportedly requested more resources to dig into potential ties between Trump associates and Russia. Virginia holds its gubernatorial elections in odd years.

Perriello, a former Democratic congressman, said in a Wednesday statement that Gillespie is refusing to “stand up to do the right thing” by calling for a special prosecutor as the country heads toward a “constitutional crisis.”

So far, Republican leaders led by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are rejecting an independent counsel in favor of pursuing existing House and Senate probes. Yet veteran Republican campaign strategists see political peril ahead as additional revelations about potential ties between Trump officials and the Russian campaign to influence the U.S. election continue to surface. That’s a particular risk after the Senate Intelligence Committee this week subpoenaed former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had previously requested immunity in exchange for his testimony.

“It’s vital that the party not handcuff themselves to Donald Trump,” said John Weaver, a former top adviser to the presidential campaigns of Senator John McCain, R-Ariz, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. “We’re ultimately going to have a special prosecutor. I don’t know why Republicans can’t read the next chapter in the book,” he said. “You’re going to see more and more Republicans coming to this conclusion.”

On Wednesday a number of Republicans, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said they were troubled by Comey’s sudden dismissal, while rejecting the idea of a special prosecutor.

Republicans argue that the history of special prosecutors is checkered, including the Ken Starr investigation of President Bill Clinton that came to be seen as political. “Historically special prosecutors go way beyond the scope” of duty, said Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist and former top adviser on Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. “McConnell’s staked out his ground, that’s just not gonna happen,” said Tyler, while allowing the possibility of an independent commission that could work in parallel to the FBI's work.

Picking Comey's successor

Democrats say the fact that Trump will appoint Comey’s successor is a clear indication that there is a conflict of interest and no choice but to put the matter to an independent counsel. Seeking to avoid that step, Republicans quickly ramped up their existing Senate-led investigation into Russia by issuing a subpoena for Flynn and sending a request to the Treasury Department’s financial crimes unit for any information on Trump and his top aides.

For Senate Democrats, whom Republicans need to pass any major legislation, that's not going far enough. “We are going hard on” demanding a special prosecutor, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. “It’s the only way,” she said, saying Trump has jeopardized the nation’s democracy by trying to control the nature of the FBI’s work.

Senate Democrats don’t have the votes to block Trump’s next FBI director. But they can inflict political pain by gumming up the works of the Senate, where Republicans need Democrats to pass major legislation, while continuing to pressure them back home.

“The constitutional crisis looming ahead of us if there is no special prosecutor, if the objectivity and independence of our justice system is imperiled, will be a barrier to accomplishing anything” in Congress, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Judiciary Committee. “There is a fundamental question about the rule of law and the trust and credibility of this administration,” he said.

Particularly after Trump's hasty firing of Comey, there are parallels being drawn between the president’s Russia ties and the Watergate burglary investigation that felled former President Richard Nixon, who resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment.

Yet during Watergate, Democrats controlled Congress, a big difference with the current controversy. Thomas A. Schwartz, a historian at Vanderbilt University, said it’s highly unlikely that a special counsel will be named in this moment. “It’s possible that Republican leaders like John McCain and Lindsey Graham could decide to break ranks with their party if public and political pressure ramped up considerably,” Schwartz says. “But unless there is significant public pressure to get a special counsel, Trump is probably safe,"" he said.

""If there are other major shoes to drop I think a lot of Republicans who may well now be on the fence could go in that direction,"" said Mike Allen, a former top aide in the George W. Bush administration. ""So far because Democrats have really made it the banner under which they are flying I think that instinctively makes some Republicans oppose it,"" he said. At least for now, ""it's a shirts versus skins thing.""

In the meantime, Democrats appear prepared to pursue a two-pronged strategy of applying pressure both in Congress and in the home districts and states of lawmakers. On Thursday, Perriello continued to pound Gillespie on Twitter. Perriello faces Lt. Gov. Ralph Northan in the June 13 primary to decide who will face Gillespie in November.

How about you put down the twitter and pick up a spine?

In Congress, Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat, is meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s constituents on Friday at a United Auto Workers hall in Kenosha as part of a new initiative organized by progressives dubbed “adopt a district.” That's where Democrats meet with the constituents of neighboring Republicans. In southern Arizona on Wednesday, Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, held a town hall in the district of Rep. Martha McSally, a neighboring Republican, in which he hammered her on the Russia issue. In a statement, McSally has called Comey’s firing “deeply concerning” and said the investigations must be “completed without political interference.” That’s short of calling for a special prosecutor.

“She’s shown she does not have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump,” including “the investigation into the Russian collusion in our election system,” Gallego said in a conference call ahead of his visit.

Weaver, the former Republican campaign adviser, drew parallels between currently hesitant members of Congress and Republicans during Watergate, when a number of Republican senators initially opposed articles of impeachment against Nixon.

“There will be a point in our party that a Barry Goldwater or a Howard Baker will have to emerge that has the standing within the party that says this is too far. We cannot support it,"" said Weaver. “You would think it would be based on principle,"" he said, but unfortunately “there’s no interest like self-interest,” he said. “We’re getting there.”

While most of the sports world is making jokes about the Big Baller Brand shoes these days, one guy who isn't laughing is New Orleans Pelicans guard Jordan Crawford.

On his Twitter account Wednesday, Crawford told his followers that he bought a pair of the ZO2 shoes, the ones that start at $495 a pair.

Now apparently Crawford had only heard about the shoes before purchasing. He asked folks on Twitter to help him.

Crawford has bounced around the NBA since 2010 when, after being drafted by the New Jersey Nets, he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks on draft night. Then he was moved from the Hawks to the Washington Wizards on a trade deadline deal in his rookie season. At the 2013 trade deadline he was traded from Washington to the Boston Celtics, then Boston moved him to Golden State in January 2014. He was out of the league for the next two seasons and signed a contract with the Pelicans in March of this year.

He has averaged 12.3 points for his career with 3.2 assists.

According to ESPN's business reporter Darren Rovell, Crawford's shoes cost more than $495, because he ordered a size 14.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Trump, right, talks to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin as Vice President Pence listens at the Oval Office in the White House, May 10, 2017. Trump said the U.S. supports Ukraine, Klimkin told USA TODAY. (Photo: Embassy of Ukraine)

WASHINGTON — Ukraine's foreign minister said he received assurances from President Trump and Vice President Pence of support from the United States, as Russia expands its influence in separatist-held eastern Ukraine.

In an interview with USA TODAY, Pavlo Klimkin said, ""Without U.S. engagement, it's not possible to sort this out, because Russia has respect for the United States.""

Klimkin’s visit to the White House Wednesday was overshadowed by Trump’s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Trump expressed his desire to work with Ukraine “to peacefully resolve the conflict,” the White House said in a statement. Pence emphasized that the negotiated cease-fire agreements “remain the most viable path toward peace.""

""It was very important to hear,"" Klimkin said. Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine are making peace harder to achieve, he added.

For example, Russian rubles must now be used as currency in the Donbas region, instead of Ukrainian hryvnas, for all transactions, including paying employees of Ukrainian companies. That mandate, in place since March 1, required transferring large amounts of currency from Russia, which Klimkin said could not have happened without Russian approval and involvement.

In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Feb. 18 recognizing passports and other documents issued by the self-described People’s Republic of Donetsk and People’s Republic of Luhansk.

On March 17, separatist authorities seized private and Ukrainian state-owned factories and mines, he said. One result is that owners in Ukraine have no legal way to communicate with Ukrainian companies in the Donbas, Klimkin said. Commodities, such as coal and iron ore produced in the separatist-held areas, are being illegally transferred and sold in Russia, he said.

And, Klimkin said, Russian state-owned media and the separatist-held region also started “talking about ‘the nation of Donbas,’ which never existed.”

“It’s not a random sequence of actions,” he said. “It’s an intentional sequence to bring the occupied Donbas far, far away from Ukraine.”

The fighting in eastern Ukraine, which started after demonstrators ousted a pro-Russian government in February 2014, has escalated in recent months, despite cease-fire agreements negotiated with Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany in Minsk, Belarus. While Russia denies arming the separatists, Ukrainian, U.S. and other Western authorities have documented Russian military support and direct involvement in the conflict that has resulted in 10,000 Ukrainian deaths.

The U.S. and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Lavrov on Wednesday that U.S. sanctions won't be lifted until Russia reverses its actions.

The Minsk agreement requires the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the restoration of Ukrainian law in the separatist-held regions. The deal also calls for Ukraine to establish a ""special status"" for the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that includes self-governance and cross-border cooperation with Russia. While fighting continues, that special status provision will not be accepted or adopted by Ukraine, according to Oksana Syroid, deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament.

Ukrainians ""will not allow it,"" Syroid said last week in Washington. ""It's against human dignity.""

Klimkin said Russia maintains 6,000 military troops, 2,000 tanks and other heavy weapons in the separatist-held area of Ukraine. Unless the recent changes are reversed, he warned that the situation there will become permanent.

6,Poll: Majority of Americans don't think Comey firing was appropriate,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

A majority of Americans don't believe President Trump's sudden firing of James Comey was appropriate, according to a new poll.

The NBC News and SurveyMonkey online poll found that 54% of Americans believed Comey's dismissal was inappropriate, while 38% thought it was appropriate.

The poll was released the same day that Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he had planned to fire Comey ""regardless of (the Justice Department's) recommendation.""

The White House had previously asserted that Comey was fired based on the recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who lambasted Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

However, according to the survey, 46% of Americans believe that Comey was fired because he is overseeing an FBI investigation into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the presidential election.

A 24% faction believe it was because of the Clinton email investigation. Another 22% said the firing was because of something else.

Even though Americans are clearly suspicious of Trump's motives for firing Comey, they don't necessarily like the former FBI director. About 4 out of 10 Americans (44%) said they did not approve of how Comey did his job as FBI director. Only 25% said they approved, and another 28% said they didn't know enough to say.

Comey's recent tenure has been marked by two widely publicized probes – and he didn't get high approval ratings for how he handled either of them. Comey made the unusual decision of coming out in July to announce he was not recommending prosecution against Clinton for her use of a private email server during secretary of State, only to announce he was reopening the probe just 11 days before the November election.

The poll found Comey had a low, 19% approval rating for how he handled the Clinton email probe. Another 57% said they disapproved of his handling of that investigation.

Comey earlier this year announced the FBI was in the middle of a full blown counterintelligence investigation into whether there was any collusion between Russia and Trump campaign associates. Only 34% of Americans said they approved of how he was handling the Russia investigation, while 27% disapproved.

Still, following Comey's ouster, a majority of people (55%) said they were now less confident that the Russia investigation would be fairly conducted. Comparably, 36% said it made them more confident.

A majority of people (54%) said they believed that the alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials is a serious issue. Another 40% said it was more of a distraction.

The poll was conducted online from May 10 to May 11 among a national sample of 3,746 adults.

MOSCOW (AP) — Several activists were detained in Moscow on Thursday as they prepared to submit signatures they have collected to protest arbitrary detentions and torture of gay men in Chechnya.

The anti-gay abuse first was reported in April by the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which said about 100 suspected gay men were rounded up and tortured, and at least three were killed.

The Associated Press separately interviewed two Chechen men who spoke of torture and corroborated the reports.

LGBT activist Igor Yasin said five people were detained Thursday outside the Prosecutor General's Office as they brought about 2 million signatures to protest the treatment of gay people in the predominantly-Muslim region in Russia's south.

The New York-based civic group Avaaz, which helped collect the signatures worldwide, said in a statement that one of the people detained in the morning was an Italian activist.

Avaaz's campaign director, Bert Wander, described the detentions as a ""blatant attempt by Russia to intimidate those standing up for gay people (which) will only draw more global attention to the horrors unfolding in Chechnya.""

President Vladimir Putin last week assured the country's human rights ombudswoman that he would speak with law enforcement officials about the reported torture of gay men.

Tatyana Moskalkova, the ombudswoman, has asked for a task force to be formed to investigate the treatment of gays in Chechnya.

6,Trump put a voter ID hawk in charge of his 'Election Integrity' group,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order chartering an investigation into alleged corruption in the American electoral system -- an institution he has repeatedly smeared with baseless charges of mass voter fraud.

But as much or more than the initiative itself, the early criticism has been trained on its designated point man, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.

Opponents past and present responded with anger on Thursday as news of his involvement spread.

""Kris Kobach being named to run a commission on 'voter integrity' is like naming Bernie Madoff to run a commission on financial crimes,"" Frank Sharry, the founder and executive director of America's Voice, an immigrant group, said in a statement. ""His bigotry and radicalism have no place in our federal government. Any commission which Kobach leads has no integrity.""

Kobach, who consulted Trump during the transition, got his first taste of Washington during a stint as an immigration law adviser in the George W. Bush administration.

Alison Krauss' first solo record in 18 years, Windy City, was inspired by two different sources: the photographs of Bob Richardson, and producer Buddy Cannon. She’d sung harmony on records Cannon produced for artists including Jamey Johnson, and realized that she wanted to make an album with him at the helm.

“We talked about only having songs that were older than me, but we ended up changing that when we figured out how old I was,” Krauss, 45, joked to The Tennessean. “Actually I thought it was more important that they all fit together. I think they did.”

A couple of their choices, like John Hartford’s Gentle on My Mind and the Cindy Walker/Eddy Arnold song You Don’t Know Me, are familiar to the casual country music listener. But the majority of songs Krauss and Cannon chose for Windy City are lesser-known gems, like River in the Rain, a Roger Miller-penned song for a Broadway musical about Huckleberry Finn.

9,Hall of Fame QB has an idea to make sure Deflategate never happens again | FOX Sports,"Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese has a pretty simple way of ensuring there won’t be a repeat of the Deflategate saga: just get rid of the rule regarding minimum air pressure in the footballs.

Griese believes that quarterbacks should have final say over how much air pressure should be in the balls, eliminating the need for another QB to go through the controversy that eventually led to the league suspending New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

“You know all this business about Deflategate and all that other stuff, what’s wrong with taking a little bit of air out of the ball and still making it legal?’’ Griese told Patriots.com. “It’s a passing league anyway. You want quarterbacks to be able to throw the ball in December when it gets colder and the ball gets slick, which it does, or in the rain when it gets slippery. Why not take a little air out of the ball? Lower the amount of air you can have in the ball, and if some quarterbacks like it harder, then you can pump it up a little. Change the degrees of error a little bit. It’s just a comfort level thing. The balls back when I played were a lot different than they are today, and I had small hands, so it was really a problem for me at times.’’

You can accuse Griese of just looking out for a fellow quarterback, but he’s also coming to the defense of a player who has tormented his former team – the Dolphins. Brady and the Patriots took legal action against the league in an attempt to avoid a suspension, but Brady eventually relented, announcing last July that he would not appeal his four-game suspension to the U.S. Supreme Court, ending the saga that lasted more than a year.",fox-sports

The Rosie O'Donnell-Donald Trump feud takes a new turn, with the firing of James Comey this week.

The president resurfaced a tweet O'Donnell sent out months ago.

""FIRE COMEY,"" the comedian and actress tweeted back in December. Her note came as a a reply to Brian Fallon, the press secretary for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Fallon had tweeted earlier that day that ""Comey's intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at the time.""

President Trump retweeted O'Donnell on Thursday, with his own comments: ""We finally agree on something Rosie.""

We finally agree on something Rosie. https://t.co/BSP5F3PgbZ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2017

The two have feuded for years. Back in 2006, they sparred, with O'Donnell saying Trump was not a self-made man and Trump calling her a ""real loser.""

Fast forward to the last presidential cycle, and their fight became front and center of the political world. In August 2015, when debate moderator Megyn Kelly asked about the language he used to describe women — ""You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals"" — Trump quickly retorted, ""Only Rosie O'Donnell.""

A year later, Trump brought up O'Donnell again during a debate with Hillary Clinton: ""Somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.""

O'Donnell remains a vocal critic of Trump's.

9,Joanna Jedrzejczyk wants to be a two-division champion just like Conor McGregor | FOX Sports,"The addition of the women’s flyweight division later this year has Joanna Jedrzejczyk contemplating a chance to make history sooner rather than later.

The reigning and defending women’s strawweight champion has flirted with the idea of moving up to 125 pounds previously but now that the UFC is set to crown the first ever champion in the division later this year, it’s now becoming a reality.

While Jedrzejczyk is laser focused on her title fight this weekend against Jessica Andrade at UFC 211, she can’t ignore the possibility of winning a second world title while joining Conor McGregor as the only simultaneous two division champions in UFC history.

“Maybe next year, I will fight for the second belt. Why not? It’s a big challenge, probably the challenge of my life. We will see,” Jedrzejczyk said on Thursday in Dallas.

Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

Of course, Jedrzejczyk expects to get the same blowback that McGregor received when he began serious pursuit of a second world title while already reigning as champion in a different division.

As McGregor went through two fights with Nate Diaz before finally facing Eddie Alvarez last November for the lightweight title, the featherweight division where he was also champion sat somewhat stagnant as contenders were all hoping for a shot at him.

Jedrzejczyk understands that argument, but she also wants to live out her dreams and goals and nothing would taste sweeter than becoming the first woman in UFC history to hold two titles at the same time.

“I remember when I was talking about this division a year ago people were like ‘focus on your belt’. I’m going for my fifth title defense. That’s the thing, why not? I have bigger, bigger goals and dreams. If I don’t win this second belt, nothing is going to happen because like I said, I already reached my goals and dreams, but there is something better coming,” Jedrzejczyk said.

“People were saying the same to Conor [McGregor] when he was saying he wants to be a king in two different divisions. Same with me. I just want to challenge myself and this is what I’m doing in my life.”

Of course, McGregor promised that he would eventually defend both titles but he never got the chance when the UFC stripped him of the featherweight belt less than a month after becoming a two division champion.

While she can’t predict the future, Jedrzejczyk believes she could stay busy and active enough to defend both titles if she’s fortunate enough to win a championship at 125 pounds.

“If I became a champion [at] 125, I will be jump between 115 and 125,” Jedrzejczyk said. “I want to be the real champion of two different divisions.”",fox-sports

Nicole Kushner Meyer and other executives will not attend investor presentations in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, a spokesman for Kushner Companies told CNNMoney on Thursday. The move was previously reported by The Washington Post.

The real estate business drew criticism after Meyer mentioned her brother and his job as a top White House adviser during a sales pitch last weekend in Beijing. Jared Kushner is married to President Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Kushner Companies was courting investors for a New Jersey development called 1 Journal Square. Ethics watchdogs said Meyer appeared to be leveraging family ties to the White House to enrich the family business. The company later apologized.

Kushner Companies sought to attract real estate investors through a U.S. visa program called EB-5. It promises immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs stateside. The program is frequently used by wealthy Chinese nationals.

Colin Kaepernick is still a quarterback without a job, but there apparently are still teams in the NFL that are curious about his prospects.

Harry Edwards, the renowned sociologist who has been an adviser to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, told USA TODAY Sports that three teams have contacted him about Kaepernick since the free agency period opened in March.

This, amid speculation that Kaepernick, 29, is being blackballed after igniting a movement last season when he protested police brutality and racial inequalities by refusing to stand for the national anthem.

“They’ve asked, ‘Can he play? Does he want to play?’ “ Edwards said. “The last question I can’t answer. The first question, absolutely. If Kaep makes up his mind, he wouldn’t only go in and make a team, he’d put pressure on somebody to start.”

MORE COVERAGE:

It is certainly baffling, from a football sense, that a man with a Super Bowl start on his resume hasn’t been offered as much as a backup slot in a league with a dearth of quarterback talent. Even Blaine Gabbert, who was benched last season when Kaepernick returned to the starting lineup, has a new job. Gabbert signed with the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday.

Kaepernick, meanwhile, hasn’t been publicly linked to any team. Although Kaepernick has been seen publicly while engaged in some charity causes during the offseason, he hasn’t commented on his football prospects. Edwards, also a consultant to the 49ers, wouldn’t reveal which teams contacted him and said that he hasn’t spoken to Kaepernick since he opted out of his San Francisco contract.

Is Kaepernick’s lack of opportunity essentially backlash for his protests?

“I don’t think there’s any question that there are some owners who wouldn’t have him in the league, much less on their team,” Edwards said. “But I fully expect one (team to sign him), because it’s in the best interest of the league to have him on a team.

“You can’t have a league that’s approaching 80% black, and then say it you stand up and say anything relevant to these issues – especially in the age of (President) Trump – this is what happens to you. You can’t do that. You can’t just up and right off black protests as if this were 1950.”

In March, ESPN reported that Kaepernick would resume standing for the anthem. Yet that apparently hardly moved the needle on his market appeal.

If he doesn’t wind up with a team, Edwards suggests that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell find a position for Kaepernick at league headquarters.

“I want to hear what he thinks and what he has to say about what’s going on in the league,” Edwards said.

Of course, the best-case scenario is to hear from Kaepernick while he also has the chance to demonstrate that he can still play in the NFL, too.

9,Yair Rodriguez explains why he can be a bigger star than Canelo Alvarez in Mexico | FOX Sports,"As the UFC continues to expand into Latin America, featherweight contender Yair Rodriguez would like to become the new face of the promotion in Mexico with hopes to even surpass Saul “Canelo” Alvarez as the biggest combat sports star in his home country.

Now that might sound like very lofty aspirations considering Alvarez has become one of the biggest sports stars in all of Mexico while also becoming a real draw for the sport of boxing.

Alvarez’s most recent fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. reportedly sold around one million pay-per-views, which is a massive landmark for the 26-year old Mexican boxer.

Now Rodriguez makes it clear that he has no ill will towards his fellow countryman whatsoever, but he still believes in the long term that he could become an even bigger draw for the Mexican faithful than what “Canelo” is currently pulling for his fights.

“He became a big star. Well why him being Mexican and being a fighter, can I not become a big star in Mexico? Why not? It doesn’t make any sense for me when people ask me,” Rodriguez explained when speaking to FOX Sports. “Why not?

“If I become a champion, if I become the first Mexican UFC champion, I can become bigger because I will be the first one. There are already a lot of Mexican boxers, great boxers. I’m not saying Canelo is not great. He’s great. But I think I can become bigger than that because I’ll be the first one.”

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports

Lofty goals indeed for Rodriguez but there’s no lack of confidence in the surging featherweight star ahead of his next fight at UFC 211 this weekend.

To remain on his path to become the first ever Mexican born UFC champion, Rodriguez will have to get past Frankie Edgar on Saturday night and that’s no easy task.

Edgar has sat atop two divisions during different stages in his UFC career while currently being ranked No. 2 at featherweight sitting behind only champion Jose Aldo and interim champion Max Holloway. In fact, Edgar has only been defeated by Aldo since moving down to 145 pounds while racking up wins over every other fighter he’s faced including stoppages over Cub Swanson and Chad Mendes.

Despite that resume, Rodriguez not only believes that he can beat Edgar at UFC 211, but he wants to add another career first to his record as well.

He wants to be the first person to hand Edgar a loss by knockout.

“I think he’s never fought a guy like me,” Rodriguez said about Edgar. “Everybody thinks I’m fast, but they don’t know how fast I am until they fight me. Whenever they fight me, they can never find me. I think Frankie Edgar has the potential for me to knock him out because the way that he moves and he’s short. I like to fight short guys because my range helps me out a lot. So I think it’s just because of that.”

As much as the hype around this fight centers around Rodriguez taking a big step up in competition to face a former champion like Edgar, he refuses to acknowledge that this matchup is any tougher than the others he’s faced in the past.

It’s not that Rodriguez doesn’t see Edgar as a threat, but instead he prefers to focus on what he’s doing to get ready for the fight rather than putting any opponent on a pedestal.

“For me it’s just one more fight. With all respect to him, he’s just one more fight for me,” Rodriguez said. “I treated B.J. Penn the same, I treated Alex Caceres the same, I treat any fighter the same. It doesn’t matter. Because for me, they’re just a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re the champion or not. For me, that doesn’t matter. I’m going to treat you the same because you are a human being.

“You have a brain, you have a heart, you have two arms and two legs. You train just like me. It doesn’t matter where you think you are. I’m going to treat you the same.”",fox-sports
6,Could Trump have obstructed justice?,"Jimmy Gurulé is a law professor at Notre Dame and a former under secretary for enforcement at the US Department of the Treasury, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs, and assistant US attorney. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.

President Trump's claims that this dismissal was justified based on Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal are curious, given that during the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump enthusiastically praised and applauded Comey's decision to reopen the Clinton investigation -- after initially rebuking Clinton for her carelessness and concluding she had committed no crime. Back then, Donald Trump portrayed Comey's actions as a profile in courage. So what accounts for this sudden and dramatic change of opinion?

Ultimately, Comey may have been fired not because he wasn't doing a good job, as Trump claims, but because he was doing his job too well -- and that's bad news for the President, because it puts him within range of obstruction of justice charges. Evidence that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice could serve as the basis of impeachment proceedings.

Two significant events may explain this bizarre turn of events. First, grand jury subpoenas were recently served on associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, indicating the FBI investigation was aggressively moving forward. As a former federal prosecutor, I have conducted dozens of grand jury investigations and subpoenaing someone to testify is a serious matter. Witnesses testify under oath and knowingly making a material false statement could result in perjury charges. Moreover, witnesses are not subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury unless they are suspected of having knowledge or evidence of a crime. Obviously, this was not good news for the Trump administration, who desperately want to change the narrative and terminate the criminal investigation.

Second, days before his firing, Comey requested a significant increase in money and personnel to expand the scope of the FBI inquiry involving the Russians and Trump's campaign, according to news reports. The Justice Department denied this allegation. A request for additional resources would mean the FBI had identified significant evidentiary leads that needed to be investigated more fully. It seems likely the FBI investigation was proceeding forward with no end in sight.

If the President's real reason for firing Comey was to derail or obstruct the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and Trump associates to influence the outcome of the presidential election, this could warrant serious legal consequences. More specifically, Trump's actions could constitute obstruction of justice, a federal felony offense.

Most obstruction of justice charges are filed under the omnibus clauses of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 and § 1505 , where the government must prove that: (1) the defendant acted with ""corrupt"" intent (in this case, intent to interfere with or thwart the investigation); (2) the defendant endeavored to interfere with a pending judicial proceeding; (3) there was a sufficient ""nexus"" between the defendant's actions and the pending proceeding (the actions were likely to affect the judicial proceedings); and (4) the defendant acted with knowledge that the judicial proceedings were pending. Further, and most critically in this case, the defendant need not actually obstruct the pending judicial proceeding, but only ""endeavor"" to do so.

If you read the law and compare it to the events unfolding, it seems the actions of Donald Trump and his administration meet some of the required criteria. Trump fired Comey amid a pending grand jury investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Witnesses had been subpoenaed to appear before that grand jury. Further, Trump was likely aware of the pending grand jury proceedings, since he was constantly obsessed with the Russian investigation, and, by firing Comey, attempted to disrupt and interfere with those proceedings. Ultimately, the fundamental issue is whether Trump fired Comey with a ""corrupt"" intent, meaning to obstruct or impede the federal grand jury investigation. If so, President Trump committed a federal crime.

A Mexican businesswoman who headed a group of 600 families searching for their disappeared relatives has been killed.

Miriam Rodriguez Martinez was shot in her home in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state.

She was known for successfully investigating the kidnap and murder of her daughter by a local drug cartel, the Zetas.

The information she gave the police ensured the gang members were jailed.

But in March one of them escaped and her colleagues said she started to receive threats.

Her colleagues said she had asked for police protection but was ignored.

The Mexican human rights commission issued a statement saying it deplored her murder and called for a full investigation.

Image copyright Photoshot Image caption The UN in Mexico tweeted its condemnation of the murder

Mrs Rodriguez founded the local collective in her town for families who were victims of violence after her daughter was kidnapped in 2012.

She had managed to find her daughter's body in a clandestine grave and put her murderers in jail.

She also foiled an attempted kidnapping by the Zetas of her husband, when she chased the gang in her car, at the same time notifying the army who then managed to arrest them.

The group she established was part of a wider trend which mushroomed after the October 2014 disappearance of 43 rural student teachers studying at Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Frustrated by a lack of government help, groups of families began their own searches for people who had disappeared in their areas, taking courses in forensic anthropology, archaeology, law, buying caving equipment and becoming experts in identifying graves and bones.

There are now at least 13 of these groups across the country.

A video of an imam appearing to call for the murder of Jews in a sermon during Friday prayers at a Copenhagen mosque has caused outrage in Denmark.

Mundhir Abdallah was reported to police after being filmed citing in Arabic a hadith - a teaching of the Prophet Muhammad - considered anti-Semitic.

The hadith says the Day of Judgement ""will not come unless the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them"".

A Jewish community leader said his words were a ""thinly-veiled"" threat.

Videos of the sermon were posted on YouTube and Facebook by the Al-Faruq Mosque on Sunday, although Mr Abdallah reportedly gave it on 31 March.

A part of the 30-minute address was later translated by the Washington-based Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri).

In the video, Mr Abdallah is seen standing in front of a black flag with the Shahadah written on it, similar to those used by jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda.

He declares there will soon be a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia - that will wage jihad to unite the Muslim community and liberate the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem ""from the filth of the Zionists"".

Then, he says, ""the words of the Prophet Muhammad will be fulfilled"" and cites the hadith.

Jewish community leader Dan Rosenberg told the Politiken newspaper: ""We are concerned weak and impressionable people may perceive this kind of preaching as a clear call to violence and terror against Jews.""

Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg also expressed outrage.

10,TCL eyes the throne as one of the world's top TV makers,"“It can be overwhelming to walk into a retailer and see all the TVs on the wall. All their settings are cranked up to compete with one another,” Chris Larson, Senior Vice President, TCL tells us at a recent briefing held at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, Calif.

The discussion was about how TCL TVs … well, all TVs really, are calibrated differently for stores than they are for your home. It’s a trick TV manufacturers have been using for years – turning saturation levels up to sickening levels while cranking the brightness up to its maximum level. It’s intense, definitely, and more than a little deceitful.

But let’s not focus on that god-awful practice for a minute. Let’s focus on the wall of TVs.

For anyone who knows the difference between a composite and component cable, this wall is a visual chocolate factory – each television offering a different flavor of eye candy. We love walking into a Best Buy or Tesco to see what’s new in the world of pixels and panels. We comment on how this LG OLED might look better than Samsung’s new QLED screen, at least in terms of contrast, and quibble over whether Android TV is the best or the worst thing to ever happen to televisions in the last century.

But for others, like my parents, this section of the store – and in particular this wall of TVs – is nothing but a bunch of seemingly identical screens. Who makes a better OLED really isn’t on their list of concerns. I’ve tried to explain Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision, HDR and dozens of other technologies over the years to my parents and, honestly, they’re not interested. As long as the TV looks good and doesn’t cost much, they’re happy.

If you want to know how TCL (an acronym that at one point stood for True China Lion) became the third largest TV manufacturer in the world, it’s through people like my parents.

Quality, performance and value

Sorry, that last bit makes it sound like TCL doesn’t make very good TVs. They do. I mean, they’re not exceptional in the same way the LG Signature Series W7 OLED or the Samsung Q9F QLED TV are, but they’re quite good – especially now that they support Dolby Vision.

The reason for my visit to Dolby Labs was to check out TCL’s 2017 line-up. Two series from last year are getting a refresh (the P- and S-Series) while TCL is introducing a completely new line called the C-Series that taps into contemporary aesthetics and adds support for most HDR sources.

These TVs look good and, according to Larson, will also be priced fairly. If you’re looking for a way to help differentiate TCL from the masses of TVs on the aforementioned wall, it’s their brand promise: Delivering uncompromised experiences at a recognized value with an attractive cosmetic.

It’s a promise that seems to be harder and harder to keep every year now that new Chinese TV makers like Hisense and LeEco have moved into the market. To me, this seems like something worth fretting over, but it didn’t seem to scare anyone in that office.

Oprah might give away cars, but Ellen's got TVs covered.

Larsen told me there were already branding programs in place to help make TCL a household name. “We have a partnership with the Ellen Show and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Plus, we acquired the TCL Chinese Theater down in L.A.” Other ties include UCLA athletic teams, the San Jose Earthquakes (a MLS team based in Northern California) and the Rose Bowl, one of the biggest football games in the NCAA.

And while the list is impressive, I’m not sure a few sponsorship deals will be enough to beat out the most ubiquitous names in television like Sony, Samsung and LG – each of whom have a long and storied career in American families’ living rooms. But maybe it will be.

The grand plan

So what’s the end goal here? If TCL got this far in the TV world without an insane amount of brand recognition, why does it want to change anything?

According to Larsen, it's easy to sell smaller value TVs. It’s a crowded market, sure, but in the end value always beats out performance. But being the main screen in the house? That’s much, much harder. To get to the coveted center of the home you’ve not only got to look good in terms of picture quality and cost less than everyone else, but you need a decent design aesthetic, too.

And according to Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL, that’s where this year’s all new C-Series come in.

The new series will go on sale in late June and combines “contemporary design” (Dew’s words) and the latest in 4K HDR technology. As far as operating systems go, the TVs use Roku OS 7.5 – a close relative of the operating system used on Roku streaming boxes like the Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere+ and Roku Express.

The C-Series will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch versions and will include both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (HLG is something TCL is looking into, but not actively including on any TV this year.) They'll feature wide color gamut with advanced LED phosphor for more realistic colors, brighter highlights and increased light-to-dark contrast and support almost 100% of the DCI-P3 color space.

I left the demo impressed with what I saw. The Dolby Vision integration helped add some pizzazz to TCL’s panels, while Roku OS provided a familiar face that I knew could help me find the content I’ve been looking for.

And yet, I couldn’t help but think back to that wall.

When TCL’s latest series make it to showrooms in late June, will my parents be blown away by Dolby Vision? Will they care that the 2017 P-Series now has 72 Contrast Control Zones that increase contrast and clarity? Maybe. Maybe not.

But considering that TCL’s 55-inch C-Series TV, the 55C807, goes for $699 (around £540, AU$950), I guess it doesn’t matter.",techradar
6,OnPolitics Today: Trump contradicted himself on the Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump said FBI Director James Comey was fired because of the Clinton email investigation but later contradicted himself. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Two days. That's how long it took for President Donald Trump to upend his own administration's rationale behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the fallout from which continued to engulf Washington on Thursday.

In a letter Trump sent to Comey on Tuesday, the president wrote that he fired the director based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But in an interview Thursday with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump claimed that Sessions and Rosenstein didn't influence his decision at all. Trump had already made up his mind.

""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" said Trump, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander.""

It's OnPolitics Today, the new daily politics roundup from USA TODAY. Subscribe here.

Some key folks disagree with Trump's characterization of Comey

Trump said this week that he fired Comey because he was ""not doing a good job,"" telling Holt in his Thursday interview that ""the FBI has been in turmoil.""

You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" Trump said. ""You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago, it hasn't recovered from that.""

Except everyone does not know that, including Andrew McCabe, the FBI's new acting director. The White House said this week that Comey had lost the confidence of the bureau, a claim McCabe contradicted on Thursday when speaking to a Senate committee. “The vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,” McCabe said, which continues ""to this day.""

The firing of Comey, McCabe said, would not deter the FBI's investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia: ""Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing.""

Republican Richard Burr, the North Carolina senator chairing the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Comey "" the most ethical, upstanding individual I’ve had the pleasure to work with.""

And, for what it's worth, a new online poll from NBC News found that a slight majority of Americans — 54% — don't think Comey's sudden firing was appropriate.

So about Rod Rosenstein

The deputy attorney general is getting an invite from senators to brief them about his role in Comey's firing. According to Politico, Rosenstein reached out to Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about meeting amid reports that he was ""furious"" about the White House's characterization of his recommendation that allegedly caused Comey's firing.

Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer asked Rosenstein more than two dozen questions in a letter on Thursday, including whether Comeys' firing came days after he asked for more resources for the FBI's Russia inquiry, as has been widely reported.

The all-senators briefing with Rosentein is slated for next week, according to a spokesman Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Russia reportedly tricked Trump's White House

Optics be damned, Trump met with top Russian diplomats on Wednesday, the day after firing the man overseeing the FBI's investigation into his own campaign and Russia. In a move both surprising and not, all media was barred from the meeting except one Russia-owned news agency. Photos soon surfaced of a beaming Donald Trump with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the man who's caused much of Trump's Russia-related headaches through his communications with Trump associates, including now-fired adviser Michael Flynn.

CNN reported Thursday that the White House is furious over release of the photos, claiming the Russians ""tricked us.""

The New Yorker, long been known for its comedic covers that flirt with controversy, is taking on the firing of FBI Director James Comey and in the process comparing it to the outrage-inspiring story of the man who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight.

The cover for the May 22 issue of the magazine shows a complacent Comey being dragged down the aisle of a plane by Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is wearing a police uniform. Looking over his shoulder is the plane's captain, President Trump.

""It’s probably a bit of a leap,"" said artist Barry Blitt about his drawing for the cover, which is titled Ejected. ""James Comey is six feet eight — he probably would have been happy to give up his seat in a cramped cabin.""

An early look at next week's cover, “Ejected,” by Barry Blitt: https://t.co/HJUOYaH8qkpic.twitter.com/kCAqsAOUn5 — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) May 11, 2017

The cover instantly evokes the April 9 incident in which David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., doctor, refused to give up his seat on United flight after being involuntarily bumped. Police yanked Dao from his seat and dragged him off the plane, giving him a concussion and two lost teeth in the process.

Both the United incident and the Comey firing sparked waves of public outrage. It remains to be seen if the outcry over Comey will prove as ephemeral as that which followed Dao's rough removal.

Former UCLA forward T.J. Leaf said he’s extremely close with point guard Lonzo Ball, but that doesn’t mean he’s tempted to buy his shoes.

""The pricing is what it is,"" Leaf said Thursday from the NBA draft combine in Chicago. ""They’re going to do what they think is right at the end of the day. I’m not too close with LaVar. Obviously if I see him, I’ll say hello, talk to him a little bit. Me and Lonzo are very close. Don’t have any Big Baller gear, but we’re still very close.""

Asked about the $495 dollar price tag, Leaf laughed.

""I don’t have a comment on that,"" he said.

MORE:

Leaf, who averaged 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in his lone season for the Bruins, is a potential lottery pick along with his point guard, a potential top-three pick. Leaf said he benefited from Ball’s basketball IQ, and despite LaVar Ball’s public perception, Leaf defended the Ball family.

""There's a lot of people saying a lot of different things about him and his family,"" Leaf said. ""No one really knows. I don't know if I even really know. They have their own stuff going on in their family. And I think it's unfair for people to say things sometimes.""

But as for the Big Baller shoes? Leaf said he’s hoping to get a complimentary pair.

""Ah, you know I didn't get a pair yet,"" Leaf joked. ""Hopefully Lonzo will send me one so I can try them out. We'll see.""

6,"Trump gets 2 scoops of ice cream, everyone else gets 1","According to an extensive interview with TIME Magazine , Trump's White House staff has settled into Trump's routine and know his desires, sometimes before he does,

For example: Trump takes two scoops of ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, TIME reported, while everyone else around the table gets just one.

In the interview published Thursday, Trump also expanded on his view of Russian hacking during the 2016 election, refuted reports that he is unhappy with his current national security adviser and took a level of blame for his combative administration.

But, more than anything, Trump gave TIME a window into some of the oddities that make his White House unlike any in modern history, including the traits that make Trump tick.

Here are some illuminating takeaways from the interview:

Business at any cost

Trump casts himself throughout the interview as America's businessman, someone who is bringing his private-sector savvy to the White House to spur growth and create jobs. That focus extends to faulty digital launching systems on aircraft carriers -- ""Time and material means you're going to get your ass kicked"" -- to arms deals with unlikely African leaders.

TIME reported that Trump brought up how he is trying to mint an arms deal with an African leader who has decades-old human rights concerns, all in the name of spurring American business. Trump declined to name the country.

'It could be my fault'

Trump rarely takes blame, and throughout the 2016 campaign he said he rarely, if ever, apologizes.

But during his interview with TIME, Trump took responsibility -- sort of -- for the combative tone of his administration.

""It could be my fault,"" he said. ""I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.""

It's not an admission, but it's a close as Trump usually gets.

""I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,"" Trump told Jimmy Fallon in September 2015. ""I will absolutely apologize sometime in the distant future if I'm ever wrong.""

A level of introspection

Trump, carrying on the tenor of his vicious 2016 campaign, has made Washington a more acrimonious place. Democrats, appalled by his victory, have grown more fearful, more vocal and more disgusted. Trump has kept his foot on the gas, too, with near constant combative tweets.

But doing the TIME interview, as their dinner was wrapping up, Trump appeared to have a moment of introspection.

""It never made sense to me, the level of animosity,"" Trump said. ""All you want to do is, like, let's have a great military. Let's have low taxes. Let's have good health care. Let's have good education.""

Trump, notably, at times during the 2016 campaign demeaned his primary and general election opponents' spouses and attacked a Gold Star family. More recently, he cast the entire media as the ""enemy of the state.""

'Choke like dogs'

Can Trump lament acrimony in Washington? Yes. But he also can elevate with seven-word sentence.

Watching clips of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates' recent Senate testimony, Trump compared to the longtime government officials to dogs.

""Watch them start to choke like dogs,"" Trump said after Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, asked whether official asked for names of Trump or his associates be revealed in an intelligence report. ""Watch what happens. They are desperate for breath.""

""Ah, he's choking. Ah, look,"" Trump said after Clapper declined to provide names.

""So they surveilled me,"" he added. ""You guys don't write that -- wiretapped in quotes. They surveilled me.""",cnn

Spoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Thursday's episode of The Big Bang Theory.

For someone who often seems immune to basic human emotions, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) showed impressive dramatic flair with his marriage proposal in Thursday’s Season 10 finale of The Big Bang Theory.

The socially awkward genius impulsively flew from California to New Jersey to drop to his knee and offer an engagement ring to girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who had just started a fellowship at Princeton. In true cliffhanger mode, fans will have to wait until fall to find out Amy’s answer.

Sheldon has had the ring and thoughts of marriage for some time, but it's a romantic kiss from a returning admirer, Dr. Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), that compels him to act. He immediately leaves the office, heads to the airport, flies across the country and proposes as Amy opens her apartment door.

“We like to end the season finales on something intriguing, and we found ourselves enjoying the idea that while Amy was away another woman made a play for Sheldon,” says executive producer Steven Molaro. “Those pieces started to fit together.

“The season finale is a real pivotal moment for Sheldon and Amy,” he says. “When we shot that (proposal) scene, everybody was on stage, (including) the actors who weren’t in the scene. It was emotionally important for us to be part of it. And the studio audience just lost their minds.”

Parsons says he was surprised — but not completely — when he read the scene in the script. Sheldon has been advancing, slowly but surely, over the seasons: dating Amy, entering a committed relationship and losing his virginity with her. This season, they started living together.

Parsons spoke with Bialik about Sheldon’s motivation in proposing.

“The way it was instigated through this woman who came back into his life, there’s something very interesting that he was motivated by that,” he says. “He didn’t need a reminder that he missed (Amy). … Both of us wondered if he wasn’t trying to squash some weird feeling that he was uncomfortable with.”

Molaro, the top-rated sitcom’s head writer, says he’s not fully locked in on how Amy will respond when Bang returns for an eleventh season in the fall.

“On paper, it makes sense that she would say yes, but it’s a little complicated,” he says. “I have versions of the answer that are playing out in my head for us to talk about in the writers room. I think it’s good for a show when we pull the trigger on these momentous events even when we don’t know if we’re fully ready for it. It keeps it exciting.”

Parsons, like Sheldon, awaits Amy’s answer.

“I will be curious to see where it heads. This could be pretty straightforward,” he muses, before pausing. “Well, that’s not going to be true. Even if they go through with the wedding, there will be something weird about it.”

3,Arctic summit: Trump to make 'right decision for the US' on climate,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Cook explains why the Arctic Circle summit in Alaska matters

The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy, the secretary of state says.

Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views.

President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it.

Meanwhile, other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases.

They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action.

Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks, which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy.

Mr Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change.

Image caption Climate campaigners fear US policy will damage attempts to combat climate change

""We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,"" he said.

""We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States.""

Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015.

An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month.

The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference, which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation.

But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made.

Reading between the lines: By James Cook, BBC News, Fairbanks, Alaska

Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States.

The thrust of the text, argues Prof John Walsh, chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center, actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration.

The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide) and pollutants (like black carbon and aerosols) appears significant.

But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change, the word ""human"" is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord, an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists.

Not only that, but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection, and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review.

So, in short, it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming - and with US politics in astonishing flux, the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.",bbc-news
9,How to fix the Houston Rockets in 3 easy steps | FOX Sports,"Year One of the Mike D'Antoni era in Houston went better than anyone expected, but the Rockets' impressive 2016-17 season came to an ignoble end in Game 6 against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday.

Without Kawhi Leonard on the floor to check James Harden, Houston still rolled over and lost by 39 points at home in an elimination game.

While it wasn't the greatest way to go out this season, the Rockets can take solace in the fact they're a team on the rise. They don't need to make any earth-shaking adjustments; they just need to trust their process and make a few changes to turn the modern version of D'Antoni's Suns into a team that can compete for a title.

There was always the chance for a blowout when the San Antonio Spurs decided to sit Kawhi Leonard for Game 6 against the Houston Rockets. We just didn’t expect the Spurs to be the team delivering the thrashing.

Thanks to one of the worst nights of James Harden’s career and a much-needed big game from LaMarcus Aldridge, though, the Spurs eliminated the Rockets from the 2017 NBA playoffs with a 114-75 beatdown.

This pretty much sums up the night in Houston. #SCtop10 pic.twitter.com/OWKfaLekhS — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) May 12, 2017

Aldridge finished with 34 points on 16-for-26 shooting and 12 rebounds, while Jonathon Simmons added 18 points and four assists for San Antonio. Harden went 2-for-11 from the field, scoring 11 points and dishing seven assists in an embarrassing loss that had many questioning his MVP credentials.

The defeat is particularly irksome for Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni, who is now 5-20 in the postseason against Popovich, having lost all five series between the two.

Leonard missed Game 6 due to an ankle injury he suffered in the second half of San Antonio’s overtime Game 5 victory, as the Spurs had the luxury of a potential Game 7 at home on Sunday if they lost on Thursday night.

Mike D’Antoni is a realist.

So when the Houston Rockets head coach took a step back to evaluate this Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, he wasn’t afraid to speak some truth.

“It could be said that (the Spurs) should win,” D’Antoni told USA TODAY Sports last week before Game 3. “They’re better than us right now. We’re a little bit ahead in our progression.”

Except for one thing: He said that when Kawhi Leonard was actually playing.

The Leonard-less Spurs handed the Rockets a humiliating end to their surprise season on Thursday night at the Toyota Center, closing out the series with a 114-75 win that pits them against the vaunted Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals that will start on Sunday. With Leonard sidelined by a left ankle injury suffered in Game 5, his much-maligned co-star, 31-year-old forward LaMarcus Aldridge, had just the sort of game the Spurs had in mind when they added him in free agency in the summer of 2015.

""He's been like that through these first two rounds,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said after the win. ""He's really turned it on and demanded the ball.""

Latest NBA coverage:

The final inspired line: 34 points on 16 of 26 shooting to go with 12 rebounds. It was Aldridge’s best offensive game since May 2, 2016 when he scored 41 points in a playoff win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. More than that, it was the latest reminder that the Spurs aren’t going away anytime soon.

They lost Tim Duncan to retirement last summer, then saw veteran point guard Tony Parker go down with a season-ending quadriceps tendon tear in Game 2. The lone remaining member of their old-school trio, 39-year-old Manu Ginobili, pulled off a vintage performance in Game 5 that brought them to this point.

One game after his game-saving block on James Harden, with Harden himself having a disastrous finish (10 points on two of 10 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds, and six turnovers), the Spurs turned to their younger crew. Rookie point guard DeJounte Murray gave them 11 points, 10 rebounds and five assists off the bench (good for a plus-33 mark). Jonathon Simmons, the 27-year-old point guard who played his way to the Spurs through the NBA Development League, added 18 points on eight of 12 shooting.

""It happens,"" D'Antoni said. ""I just told the guys, they had an unbelievable year. ... We'll figure that out and get better this summer and then come back and do it again. It was a pleasure coaching them. They tried to do everything they could to make it a great year. I'm proud to be their coach. I know they feel as bad as I do.""

It would have been one thing for the Rockets to fall in this series with both sides at full strength, a respectable finish after their surprise campaign in which they had the league’s third-best record just one season after sneaking into the playoffs as the Western Conference’s eighth seed. After all, only the Warriors were better than the Spurs (61-21) this season. But this? It was as bad as season-ending exits get.

16,Outside money floods House special elections in Georgia and Montana,"Democrat Rob Quist is running for an open House seat in Montana. (Photo: Bobby Calvan, AP)

WASHINGTON — Political parties and independent groups have unleashed more than $20 million in federal races so far this year, in an early preview of the massive spending that will buffet the 2018 midterm contests for the House.

The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., tops the organizations active in early races. The group has reported already spending more than $5 million to protect Republican-held House seats in three elections this year, a USA TODAY tally of Federal Election Commission records shows.

Corry Bliss, the super PAC’s executive director, predicts the group will spend a total of $8.6 million on two fast-approaching special elections: the May 25 contest to fill an open House seat in Montana and the June 20 election for the suburban Atlanta seat vacated by House and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. The Georgia race, now down to a runoff between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, already is on track to be the nation’s most expensive House contest.

The leadership fund is looking ahead to the 2018 midterms when all 435 House members are up for re-election and has committed to spending $100 million for those elections — twice its 2016 budget.

Officials also plan to open between 20 and 30 field offices in competitive House races around the country. It’s the first time that the super PAC, which can raise unlimited sums, has added a voter-turnout operation to its election arsenal and a sign of the midterm's high stakes for the party.

“We are just getting warmed up,” Bliss said of the group’s aggressive efforts in special elections.

The president’s party generally loses ground in midterm elections, and Republicans are moving early to protect their majority in the House. Democrats need 24 seats to retake the chamber and hope they can capitalize on President Trump’s near-record unpopularity and a contentious vote this month in the House to repeal the Affordable Care Act to nab seats from Republicans. Democrats view the upcoming special elections as an early test of party strength.

“The enthusiasm here is off the charts,” Nancy Keenan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said of the race for the state’s at-large House seat.

The seat had been held by Republicans for two decades, and the GOP nominee Greg Gianforte, who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, is considered the favorite. But recent polls show a tightening race. And the Democratic nominee, musician Rob Quist, recently raised more $500,000 in just four days, Keenan said.

Quist and Gianforte also face Libertarian Mark Wicks in the election to fill the seat vacated by former Montana congressman and current Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.

Democrats face a steep climb in a rural state that Trump won by nearly 21 points last year. In one sign of the race's importance, however, Vice President Pence is set to stump for Gianforte on Friday in Billings, Mont. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, has pledged to campaign for Quist.

Seat once held by Newt Gingrich

Democrats and Republicans, however, are training most of their firepower on the special election that is still more than a month away in Georgia. Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker, has raised big sums in his quest for a seat once held by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

Ossoff collected an eye-popping $8.3 million ahead of the first round of voting in mid-April. He has not yet released fundraising totals for next month’s runoff with Handel. But Ossoff’s campaign said he took in $500,000 on April 19, the day after his first-place finish in the April 18 special election.

He received 48.1% of that vote, just shy of the 50% needed to capture the seat outright. That forced the June 20 runoff with Handel, the top Republican vote-getter.

The Congressional Leadership Fund spent $3 million in the first round of the Georgia special election and will spend another $3.5 million by Election Day, Bliss said. The super PAC is testing its new field operation in the race, deploying 90 full-time door knockers with the goal of talking to 200,000 additional voters.

Ossoff’s team also has assembled a big get-out-the-vote operation of its own, with 150 people working in six field offices, according to his aides.The campaign's staff and volunteers had knocked on more than 250,000 doors ahead of the April 18 primary alone, they said.

Read more:

The super PAC has sought to cast Ossoff as out of step with Georgians and more in line with national Democratic figures, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.

Republicans also have targeted him for living outside the district he hopes to represent. Ossoff has said he and his fiancée Alisha Kramer are temporarily living closer to Atlanta’s Emory University, where she is a medical student.

Handel, a former county commissioner, “has lived and worked and accomplished in the district for years and years,” Bliss said. “The only thing Jon Ossoff ever did in the district was be born to really rich parents.”

Ossoff “knows the district; he grew up in the district, and he’s extremely familiar with the issues,” countered his spokeswoman Sacha Haworth.

Ossofff’s team contends that the leadership fund represents the real outsiders in the race.

Although super PACs have to disclose donors’ identities, $3.5 million of the nearly $4.5 million the Congressional Leadership Fund reported raising through March 29 came from its nonprofit arm, the American Action Network, Federal Election Commission records show.

Because by the looks of it, it appears that James Harden, one of the favorites to win the MVP award this year, followed up his terrible clutch performance in Game 5 with an even worse Game 6.

An all-time bad Game 6.

Nicole Kidman is one tough food critic, not afraid to tell you when your pizza just isn't cutting it. She'll even spit it out, on live television.

Both Kidman and Ellen DeGeneres had a tough time chewing through celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis' clementine and fennel focaccia bread pizza during a cooking demonstration on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday.

As Ellen soldiered on during the tasting, chomping on the hard bread, Kidman vocalized her thoughts, before literally taking the pizza out of her mouth.

""It's a little tough. I know you're not meant to criticize. But it's a little tough,"" said Kidman, ""Don't let my kids see I did that.""

The site almost caused DeGeneres to choke on her food.

A laughing De Laurentiis pointed out, ""It's been sitting there for like five hours.""

The Ellen cooking demonstration is classic television. De Laurentiis, promoting her 13th season of Food Network Star, started off the segment teaching the duo how to make arancini balls out of leftover risotto. That brings about a flurry of ""ball"" double-entendres.

The trio laughed it up all the while as an Ellen producer kept urging them to move along.

""Isn't it meant to be relaxing?"" Kidman said at one point.

16,‘Purge’ killer given 3 life sentences,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A killer who said he was inspired by the ""Purge"" movies, was sentenced to three life sentences after a three-day rampage in May 2016 that led to the murder of three Indianapolis men. Dwight Adams/IndyStar

INDIANAPOLIS — Billy Boyd was killed one year ago Friday, as he walked home to care for his father with prostate cancer, his family says. He did not live to see the birth of his first grandchild. His father died shortly after him.

Three days later, Jose Ruiz was shot and killed. His daughter still has nightmares, his niece testified. His 18-year-old son has put off going to college.

""You could always call Billy in the middle of the night,"" his sister, Jennifer Darby, testified Thursday afternoon at the sentencing for her brother's killer, wiping away tears

Family members for 44-year-old Ruiz, 54-year-old Boyd and 40-year-old Jay Higginbotham crowded into the courtroom, sharing their pain and grief in the wake of the senseless rampage committed last year in the name of the horror film The Purge.

Marion Superior Judge Sheila Carlisle sentenced Johnathan S. Cruz, 20, of Indianapolis to three consecutive life sentences without parole for shooting and killing the three men in a three-day span last May. She also sentenced him to 16 years in prison for robbery, which will be served alongside the life sentences.

Cruz previously faced three murder charges and a slew of robbery, intimidation and gun charges. Marion County prosecutors in July notified the court the state would seek the death penalty in the case due to the allegation that Cruz killed three people in the commission of a robbery.

Last month, Cruz pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and one count of robbery. In exchange, prosecutors dropped the other charges and agreed not to pursue the death penalty.

Susan Leon, a niece of Ruiz, said her uncle was a father, husband, friend and godfather to many.

""If you needed anything, you could turn to him,"" she said.

“We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend. We've never seen this.” Terry Curry, Marion County prosecutor

Family members of Higginbotham declined to speak at the hearing, but noted for the court that they approved of the plea agreement.

After the hearing, Darby said many members of her family supported a life sentence from the beginning. She said she does not believe in the death penalty.

Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said his office took into account the defendant's possible mental health problems when considering the plea agreement.

""This individual spending the rest of his life in prison is gratifying,"" Curry said. ""He is 20 years old. His life is effectively over.""

The killing spree, according to court documents, was modeled after the horror film in which the U.S. government designates a 12-hour period where all crimes, including murder, are legal.

To witnesses, Cruz described his violent spree as a ""purge,"" court documents say. Investigators believed it was related to criminal gang activity.

""We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend,"" Curry said. ""We've never seen this.""

6,Timeline: Trump's words contradict White House answers on Comey firing,"Trump told NBC News on Thursday that he was going to fire Comey with or without Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's memo criticizing the director.

That statement contradicts at least 10 times Trump's top aides and advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, tried to explain the how and the why the President decided to sack Comey. Tuesday's unceremonious move came amid the FBI's probe into Russia's role in the 2016 election and any connections the Trump campaign had to the hackers.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation,"" Trump told NBC. He added: ""(Rosenstein) made a recommendation ... He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.""

That was not the story Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

""President Trump made the right decision at the right time to accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General,"" Pence said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said her answers ""went off that information that I had when I answered your question.""

At the time, she said, she ""hadn't had a chance"" to ask the President directly, despite having numerous conversations with him. Sanders also claimed the White House story had been ""consistent,"" despite the clear inconsistencies.

Here is a list of comments by White House staff and the vice president that were contradicted by Trump's Thursday interview:

6,Could Trump have obstructed justice?,"Jimmy Gurulé is a law professor at Notre Dame and a former under secretary for enforcement at the US Department of the Treasury, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs, and assistant US attorney. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.

President Trump's claims that this dismissal was justified based on Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal are curious, given that during the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump enthusiastically praised and applauded Comey's decision to reopen the Clinton investigation -- after initially rebuking Clinton for her carelessness and concluding she had committed no crime. Back then, Donald Trump portrayed Comey's actions as a profile in courage. So what accounts for this sudden and dramatic change of opinion?

Ultimately, Comey may have been fired not because he wasn't doing a good job, as Trump claims, but because he was doing his job too well -- and that's bad news for the President, because it puts him within range of obstruction of justice charges. Evidence that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice could serve as the basis of impeachment proceedings.

Two significant events may explain this bizarre turn of events. First, grand jury subpoenas were recently served on associates of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, indicating the FBI investigation was aggressively moving forward. As a former federal prosecutor, I have conducted dozens of grand jury investigations and subpoenaing someone to testify is a serious matter. Witnesses testify under oath and knowingly making a material false statement could result in perjury charges. Moreover, witnesses are not subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury unless they are suspected of having knowledge or evidence of a crime. Obviously, this was not good news for the Trump administration, who desperately want to change the narrative and terminate the criminal investigation.

Second, days before his firing, Comey requested a significant increase in money and personnel to expand the scope of the FBI inquiry involving the Russians and Trump's campaign, according to news reports. The Justice Department denied this allegation. A request for additional resources would mean the FBI had identified significant evidentiary leads that needed to be investigated more fully. It seems likely the FBI investigation was proceeding forward with no end in sight.

If the President's real reason for firing Comey was to derail or obstruct the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and Trump associates to influence the outcome of the presidential election, this could warrant serious legal consequences. More specifically, Trump's actions could constitute obstruction of justice, a federal felony offense.

Most obstruction of justice charges are filed under the omnibus clauses of 18 U.S.C. § 1503 and § 1505 , where the government must prove that: (1) the defendant acted with ""corrupt"" intent (in this case, intent to interfere with or thwart the investigation); (2) the defendant endeavored to interfere with a pending judicial proceeding; (3) there was a sufficient ""nexus"" between the defendant's actions and the pending proceeding (the actions were likely to affect the judicial proceedings); and (4) the defendant acted with knowledge that the judicial proceedings were pending. Further, and most critically in this case, the defendant need not actually obstruct the pending judicial proceeding, but only ""endeavor"" to do so.

If you read the law and compare it to the events unfolding, it seems the actions of Donald Trump and his administration meet some of the required criteria. Trump fired Comey amid a pending grand jury investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and the Russians. Witnesses had been subpoenaed to appear before that grand jury. Further, Trump was likely aware of the pending grand jury proceedings, since he was constantly obsessed with the Russian investigation, and, by firing Comey, attempted to disrupt and interfere with those proceedings. Ultimately, the fundamental issue is whether Trump fired Comey with a ""corrupt"" intent, meaning to obstruct or impede the federal grand jury investigation. If so, President Trump committed a federal crime.

6,"Trump gets 2 scoops of ice cream, everyone else gets 1","According to an extensive interview with TIME Magazine , Trump's White House staff has settled into Trump's routine and know his desires, sometimes before he does,

For example: Trump takes two scoops of ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, TIME reported, while everyone else around the table gets just one.

In the interview published Thursday, Trump also expanded on his view of Russian hacking during the 2016 election, refuted reports that he is unhappy with his current national security adviser and took a level of blame for his combative administration.

But, more than anything, Trump gave TIME a window into some of the oddities that make his White House unlike any in modern history, including the traits that make Trump tick.

Here are some illuminating takeaways from the interview:

Business at any cost

Trump casts himself throughout the interview as America's businessman, someone who is bringing his private-sector savvy to the White House to spur growth and create jobs. That focus extends to faulty digital launching systems on aircraft carriers -- ""Time and material means you're going to get your ass kicked"" -- to arms deals with unlikely African leaders.

TIME reported that Trump brought up how he is trying to mint an arms deal with an African leader who has decades-old human rights concerns, all in the name of spurring American business. Trump declined to name the country.

'It could be my fault'

Trump rarely takes blame, and throughout the 2016 campaign he said he rarely, if ever, apologizes.

But during his interview with TIME, Trump took responsibility -- sort of -- for the combative tone of his administration.

""It could be my fault,"" he said. ""I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.""

It's not an admission, but it's a close as Trump usually gets.

""I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong,"" Trump told Jimmy Fallon in September 2015. ""I will absolutely apologize sometime in the distant future if I'm ever wrong.""

A level of introspection

Trump, carrying on the tenor of his vicious 2016 campaign, has made Washington a more acrimonious place. Democrats, appalled by his victory, have grown more fearful, more vocal and more disgusted. Trump has kept his foot on the gas, too, with near constant combative tweets.

But doing the TIME interview, as their dinner was wrapping up, Trump appeared to have a moment of introspection.

""It never made sense to me, the level of animosity,"" Trump said. ""All you want to do is, like, let's have a great military. Let's have low taxes. Let's have good health care. Let's have good education.""

Trump, notably, at times during the 2016 campaign demeaned his primary and general election opponents' spouses and attacked a Gold Star family. More recently, he cast the entire media as the ""enemy of the state.""

Arrests included mostly US citizens

Washington (CNN) Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced its largest anti-gang operation ever on Thursday, a six-week operation that netted more than 1,300 arrests nationwide.

Though the effort was led by ICE, the focus was not exclusively on immigrants. Of the arrests, 933 were US citizens and 445 were foreign nationals, with 384 in the country illegally.

ICE said three of the arrested individuals were previous recipients of protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, instituted by the Obama administration for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.

Criminal violations or being deemed a public safety threat can void a person's DACA status.

ICE also noted that 10 of the arrests were of people who crossed the border as unaccompanied minors, eight of whom were confirmed to belong to the MS-13 gang , ICE said. Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, is strongest in Central America, especially El Salvador, but extends its criminal enterprise across the US, including cities like Los Angeles, New York and the Washington region.

Nicole Kushner Meyer and other executives will not attend investor presentations in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, a spokesman for Kushner Companies told CNNMoney on Thursday. The move was previously reported by The Washington Post.

The real estate business drew criticism after Meyer mentioned her brother and his job as a top White House adviser during a sales pitch last weekend in Beijing. Jared Kushner is married to President Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Kushner Companies was courting investors for a New Jersey development called 1 Journal Square. Ethics watchdogs said Meyer appeared to be leveraging family ties to the White House to enrich the family business. The company later apologized.

Kushner Companies sought to attract real estate investors through a U.S. visa program called EB-5. It promises immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs stateside. The program is frequently used by wealthy Chinese nationals.

In his first interview since firing the FBI director, Mr Trump told NBC News on Thursday he had asked Mr Comey whether he was under investigation.

""I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

""There's no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians,"" he added.

Mr Trump recently tweeted that the Russia-Trump collusion allegations were a ""total hoax"".

But on Thursday he denied he wanted the FBI inquiry dropped.

Many liberals had previously called for Mr Comey to be removed, blaming his updates last year about the FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails for Mr Trump's shock election victory.

The White House has depicted the Russia inquiry as ""probably one of the smallest things"" that the FBI has ""got going on their plate"".

But acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that it was ""a highly significant investigation"".

In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.

Republican committee chairman Richard Burr asked Mr McCabe if he had ever heard Mr Comey tell Mr Trump the president was not the subject of investigation.

Rosenstein's way out - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - who penned a memo detailing Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"" - brought a reputation for even-handedness and probity with him to the job of deputy attorney general. Two weeks later, that reputation is being put to the test.

Such is life in the Trump White House, where every appointee and aide is just one tweet, event or press conference away from the maelstrom.

On Tuesday night, as the administration press shop scrambled to explain the president's surprise decision to sack his FBI director, Trump supporters leaned hard on Mr Rosenstein's credentials to paint the move as a nonpartisan decision based on Mr Comey's overall job performance.

The deputy attorney general reportedly balked at the characterisation that he was the driving force behind Mr Comey's dismissal, however.

Mr Rosenstein's threat to resign is different than actually packing bags, of course, and his fate at this point is still tethered firmly to the president he chose to serve.

There is a way out, though. Due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal on the matter, it's Mr Rosenstein's call whether to appoint a special counsel to head the Justice Department's Russia investigation. It may be the one card he can play to sidestep the growing frenzy that spins around him.

A Mexican businesswoman who headed a group of 600 families searching for their disappeared relatives has been killed.

Miriam Rodriguez Martinez was shot in her home in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state.

She was known for successfully investigating the kidnap and murder of her daughter by a local drug cartel, the Zetas.

The information she gave the police ensured the gang members were jailed.

But in March one of them escaped and her colleagues said she started to receive threats.

Her colleagues said she had asked for police protection but was ignored.

The Mexican human rights commission issued a statement saying it deplored her murder and called for a full investigation.

Image copyright Photoshot Image caption The UN in Mexico tweeted its condemnation of the murder

Mrs Rodriguez founded the local collective in her town for families who were victims of violence after her daughter was kidnapped in 2012.

She had managed to find her daughter's body in a clandestine grave and put her murderers in jail.

She also foiled an attempted kidnapping by the Zetas of her husband, when she chased the gang in her car, at the same time notifying the army who then managed to arrest them.

The group she established was part of a wider trend which mushroomed after the October 2014 disappearance of 43 rural student teachers studying at Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Frustrated by a lack of government help, groups of families began their own searches for people who had disappeared in their areas, taking courses in forensic anthropology, archaeology, law, buying caving equipment and becoming experts in identifying graves and bones.

There are now at least 13 of these groups across the country.

Of those, 1,095 were confirmed as gang members, ICE said, while the remaining 238 ""were arrested on either criminal or administrative charges"".

More than 900 of the arrested were US citizens.

Acting director Thomas Homan said ""violent criminal street gangs are the biggest threat facing our communities"".

The Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit carried out the operation, its largest to date.

ICE said it was targeting gang members and ""associates"" involved in cross-border criminal activity - including drug and weapons smuggling, sex trafficking and murder.

During the six-week operation, 238 firearms were seized, alongside almost 600lb (270kg) in mixed drugs, and almost half a million dollars in cash.

Those arrested were considered ""confirmed"" as gang members, ICE said, if they admitted to membership, had been convicted of gang-related offences, had tattoos of a specific gang, or were identified ""by a reliable source"".

Of the 1,378 people arrested:

137 were affiliated with the Bloods gang of Los Angeles

104 were part of the Crips, also of Los Angeles

118 with the Surenos, a Mexican-American affiliation

104 with MS-13, born in LA but with roots in El Salvador

283 had no gang affiliation.

Is arrest of 'dreamer' a sign of things to come?

ICE also said that 10 people arrested had entered the US as unaccompanied minors - and nine of them were gang members. Another three had been part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) scheme - so called ""dreamers"", or undocumented immigrants who arrived as children who are allowed to stay,

""Aliens granted DACA who are found to pose a threat to national security or public safety may have their deferred action terminated at any time and the Department of Homeland Security may seek their removal from the United States,"" ICE said in its press release- adding that about 1,500 people have been deported for that reason since 2012.

The large-scale operation was part of Operation Community Shield, an ongoing programme which targets gang members with the help of federal and local law enforcement agencies.",bbc-news
3,Copenhagen imam accused of calling for killing of Jews,"Image copyright MEMRI Image caption Denmark's immigration minister called Mundhir Abdallah's sermon ""completely preposterous""

A video of an imam appearing to call for the murder of Jews in a sermon during Friday prayers at a Copenhagen mosque has caused outrage in Denmark.

Mundhir Abdallah was reported to police after being filmed citing in Arabic a hadith - a teaching of the Prophet Muhammad - considered anti-Semitic.

The hadith says the Day of Judgement ""will not come unless the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them"".

A Jewish community leader said his words were a ""thinly-veiled"" threat.

Videos of the sermon were posted on YouTube and Facebook by the Al-Faruq Mosque on Sunday, although Mr Abdallah reportedly gave it on 31 March.

A part of the 30-minute address was later translated by the Washington-based Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri).

In the video, Mr Abdallah is seen standing in front of a black flag with the Shahadah written on it, similar to those used by jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda.

He declares there will soon be a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia - that will wage jihad to unite the Muslim community and liberate the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem ""from the filth of the Zionists"".

Then, he says, ""the words of the Prophet Muhammad will be fulfilled"" and cites the hadith.

Jewish community leader Dan Rosenberg told the Politiken newspaper: ""We are concerned weak and impressionable people may perceive this kind of preaching as a clear call to violence and terror against Jews.""

Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg also expressed outrage.

""This is completely preposterous, undemocratic and awful,"" the centre-right Venstre politician wrote on Facebook. ""But it also shows why we need to lead a harsh and consistent policy. We cannot and should not accept this!""",bbc-news
3,Arctic summit: Trump to make 'right decision for the US' on climate,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Cook explains why the Arctic Circle summit in Alaska matters

The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy, the secretary of state says.

Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views.

President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it.

Meanwhile, other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases.

They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action.

Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks, which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy.

Mr Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change.

Image caption Climate campaigners fear US policy will damage attempts to combat climate change

""We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,"" he said.

""We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States.""

Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015.

An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month.

The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference, which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation.

But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made.

Reading between the lines: By James Cook, BBC News, Fairbanks, Alaska

Image copyright AFP

Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States.

The thrust of the text, argues Prof John Walsh, chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center, actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration.

The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide) and pollutants (like black carbon and aerosols) appears significant.

But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change, the word ""human"" is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord, an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists.

Not only that, but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection, and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review.

So, in short, it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming - and with US politics in astonishing flux, the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.",bbc-news
10,Microsoft Build 2017: the biggest highlights and all the news,"The second keynote of Build 2017 didn't disappoint when it came to big announcements, and there were even a few surprises that took everyone in attendance and watching by surprise.

Whether another update coming soon for Windows 10, new features, cross-platform collaborations, a Mixed Reality accessory and a whole new design language, Microsoft gave us plenty to digest as it put a bow on Build.

Read on for the biggest highlights of Day 2, and jump to the next page to catch up on everything that happened on Day 1.

Windows 10 Fall Creators Update

Microsoft is releasing another update to its Windows 10 operating system later this year, and it's appropriately called the Fall Creators Update.

Within the update are several new features, some of which we'll dive into in just a little bit. Much of the update centers around a new design language, a unified and responsive experience for users, new applications, and letting users work quickly and seamlessly from any device, whether Windows, iOS and Android.

A big part of the Fall Creators Update is a new design language for developers, called the Fluent Design System. It will allow for responsive, unified apps, experiences and interactions within Windows 10. Developers can create ""more expressive and engaging apps"" with it, Microsoft says, and one of its most important features is that it creates a harmonious experience across devices and platforms.

In other words, no more using an app that looks and responds a certain way on one device only to find it's completely different on another device – a jarring experience, to say the least.

Fluent Design also aims to improve input diversity, letting users interact with their machines using touch, pen, voice, gestures and even eye control.

The simplest way to think of Fluent Design is that it will allow for harmonious and responsive cross-device experiences, which should be a boon for developers and users alike.

Fall Creators Update features and the Microsoft Graph

If you can't tell by a now, a major focus for Microsoft is improving the Windows experience not only across devices, but across platforms.

To that end, it introduced Microsoft Graph. Using the cloud to connect devices and experiences, Microsoft built the Graph API to allow for seamless moving between Windows, iOS and Android. Basically, Microsoft wants the competing platforms to play nicely with each other in addition to improving the experience on Windows machines.

Several new features, coming with the Fall Creators Update, are part of the Microsoft Graph picture. Here are the ones Microsoft highlighted today:

The new Timeline feature will let users retrace their steps to whatever they were doing last, such as recently accessed files, apps and websites they want to pull up again without starting from scratch. A visual timeline lets users see what they've done and select where they want to go. Think of it like macOS' Time Machine, but for hopping back to whatever was last on your desktop.

Along the same lines is the Pick Up Were You Left Off feature (Microsoft may want to shorten the name). With Cortana, users can move activities across Windows, iOS and Android devices, such as starting a doc on a Windows PC and picking it up on an Android phone.

Clipboard elicited a buzz from the Build crowd when announced. It lets users copy text from one device and paste it onto a phone, no matter who that phone is made by. Microsoft gave the example of copying the name of a business you're researching from a PC and pasting it into Google Maps on a Samsung Galaxy S8, to give you an idea.

Last but not least is OneDrive Files on Demand, a feature that lets you access any file you have stored in the cloud without downloading it. This will be great for saving space on your devices as well as collaborative projects. All changes made in the cloud will appear the next time you pull up a file. OneDrive Files on Demand will head to preview versions of Windows 10 in early summer.

Windows Story Remix

Microsoft announced a brand-new app made for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, called Windows Story Remix.

This a creative app lets users edit their photos and videos, adding everything from filters to music to 3D augmented reality objects.

Story Remix can stitch together footage from different sources to create one video, and can intelligently identify people in an image or clip. The aim is to help users create shareable moments, tapping into the creative tools provided by Microsoft and others as well as AI and the Microsoft Graph.

iTunes is coming to the Windows Store

If you need to re-read that, we understand. No one in the Build crowd seemed to anticipate that iTunes is coming to Microsoft's digital marketplace, but as Terry Myerson revealed on stage, it's indeed true.

Apple's iTunes will arrive later this year, giving Windows users access to all it has to offer, including Apple Music.

While PC owners could already download iTunes from Apple directly, this marks the first time the service will be available right in the Windows Store.

This is a huge get for Microsoft's marketplace as it's notorious for having poor app selection. It's also a sign of Microsoft's embrace of competing platforms and services, a big change of course for the company.

Microsoft's Mixed Reality motion controllers

The one bit of new hardware Microsoft unveiled at Build are its own Mixed Reality motion controllers, designed for the suite of Windows Mixed Reality headsets on the way from various partners.

What really sets the controllers apart is that they don't require trackers positioned throughout a room, as you need with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive controllers to create a sense of room scale.

Instead, Microsoft's controllers rely on sensors inside the Mixed Reality headsets to track motion and pick up commands, meaning not only is there no extra installation, but you don't have to pay for any sensors.

What's more, this could make the whole system more portable as you don't need sensors set up anyone's house in order to use them.

The best bit of news is how affordable the controllers appear to be: though we don't know how much they cost on their own, Acer's Mixed Reality headset is getting bundled with the controllers for just $399, going on sale this holiday. That's significantly cheaper than what you'll find from Oculus or HTC.

Developers can pre-order Windows Mixed Reality headsets starting today

Microsoft is certainly moving the mixed reality ball forward, and its hardware partners are right along side.

It was revealed today that the developers in the US and Canada can pre-order Acer and HP's Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition headsets starting today from the Microsoft Store, and the devices will be delivered later this summer. Acer's headset is priced at $299 while HP's design is $329.

Though a shame you can't buy these headsets yet, it does mean developers get a chance to start working on Mixed Reality applications and other content before the headsets become available to consumers. This is how Oculus Rift released, and it's a smart play by Microsoft.

10,Microsoft brings your hands into mixed reality with surprisingly affordable controllers,"It feels like we’ve known about Microsoft’s Mixed Reality headsets for the longest time, but at Build 2017 we’re finally getting our first look at the VR controllers.

Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers might look similar to those we’ve seen from the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, however, it doesn’t need a tracker. Rather than setting up light boxes IR cameras, sensors in the headset work in tandem with the motion controllers to deliver precise sub-millimeter control and responsive tracking of movement in the user’s field of view.

It’s a far simpler setup we appreciate and given the lower hardware requirements of Microsoft’s Mixed Reality platform, we might actually be able take to a friend’s house and share.

Forget VR, this is the best gaming mouse you can buy

Unfortunately, Microsoft decided not to demo the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers on stage, so we won't get a good look at how well they work until we get some hands on time with them.

What’s even, more impressive about this whole setup is the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers on stage with Acer Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display will come bundled together for just $399 (about £310, AU$540) – and the bundle is available for pre-order right now and will arrive this holiday.

Microsoft also announced developer versions of the Acer and HP Mixed reality headsets on their own are also up for pre-order on the Microsoft Store for $299 (about £230, AU$400) and $329 (about £250, AU$440), respectively to release this summer.",techradar

The Fire HD 8 price was already nearly unbeatable compared to the competition, but this Mother's Day deal definitely makes it a tablet worth checking out.",techradar
10,Microsoft unveils the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update,"Microsoft has announced that its next big update to Windows 10 will be the Fall Creators Update and it’s coming later this year.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar
10,Prey review,"In Arkane’s smart and stylish revival of the 2006 first-person shooter, the moon-orbiting Talos 1 space station is being overrun by Typhon, a shape-shifting collective of aliens. It’s up to your character, Morgan Yu, to fight back by any means necessary. However, your goal is just as much about finding a motive worth fighting for.



Is there anyone left to save? Can I actually make a difference? And why am I in the middle of it all? These are all questions that you’ll answer with your actions, or at least try to, throughout the roughly 20 hour campaign.



For some gamers, a gun in-hand is reason enough to truck through to the game’s end. Prey is an action game, after all, so it wastes little time rolling out a pistol, wrench and shotgun, as well as a few other futuristic weapons, like the GLOO gun that freezes enemies in their tracks.



But if you’re looking for more depth in your FPS games, it’s not too difficult to find it here. Prey features a large skill tree filled with fun, upgradeable abilities that will make your trek feel dynamic and fresh, no matter your style of play.



Mixed in with the balance gunplay and supernatural abilities, players can further mix up their strategy by crafting items to build up your offense against the Typhon.



Unlike games like Arkane’s own Dishonored, and BioShock, you aren’t delivered an ending based on your level of violence or lack thereof. The multiple endings hinge on some big decisions you make throughout the story, both in the main quest and in how you handle many of its sidequests.



While Prey is a solid offering on almost all accounts, it misses the mark in a few areas. While performance on the PC was rock-solid, the clumsy melee combat controls never really seem to jive with the hectic movement of the Typhon creatures. And its story, which concludes majestically, takes a little too long to find its groove and misses a beat from time to time.

Talos 1 is so detail-packed that you’ll probably want to squeeze every drip out of it, but the game frustratingly steps on its own toes at times. For example, it’s all too easy to become overwhelmed with quest objectives that have you zipping around the environment faster than you can memorize its layout.



Also, character dialogue will sometimes overlap with audio logs, which essentially makes you miss out on two potentially important bits of story at once and is a little immersion-breaking for the serious atmosphere that Arkane has made.



All said, if you’re a fan of FPS games and enjoy a sci-fi setting, Prey is a must-play. But for the more discerning player, those few minor flaws might stand in your way of total enjoyment.

The tale on Talos 1

Prey is, more or less, an open-world game. As you explore Talos 1 on foot (and outside of it in glorious microgravity), you’ll come across new quests to take on and be treated to many bits of environmental storytelling and collectable lore in the form of notes and audio logs.



If you look and listen closely, you’ll notice the excellent narrative details put into the game, which paints a humanizing (or sometimes, dehumanizing) picture of life on the space station just before, and as, shit hit the fan with the Typhon invasion.

Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6

Prey has many layers to its narrative, but mostly leaves it up to you to peel them all back. It’s a shame that some of its more memorable beats are hidden away, but at least it gives you all the more reason to go back through the journey a second time.



Speaking on the bigger moments in the story that you can’t help but see play out in front of you, many of them unfold exactly as you’d expect. Thankfully, a few big curve balls tossed in along the way really help to avoid being fatigued by familiarity.

Attack and release

A few things are made very clear from the start of the game: you are outnumbered and outmaneuvered by the Typhon.



Ranging from the small, Half-Life headcrab-like Mimics, to the intimidating bipedal Phantoms (and a few others that I won’t spoil for you), the struggle is made just a little more bearable by knowing each enemy’s weakness, discoverable by scanning it with the Psychoscope a la Metroid Prime.



Equipped with this intel, finding the ideal mix and match of assault combos for each enemy type is endlessly satisfying. For most of the beasts, applying some motion-freezing GLOO, followed by some wrench action yields decent results. At best, you’ll lose little health and waste almost no resources in the process.

Speaking of resources, Prey features a robust inventory management system that’s actually a lot of fun to use. The remains of slain Typhon, as well as other scraps and abandoned tech can be salvaged for raw materials for use in crafting items like ammo, medkits and other things that are rare to come by during play, especially in the game’s tough later sections.



That said, there certainly are some encounters that call for the boomstick. And even though you aren’t punished for brute forcing your way through the game, the style of play that yielded the best results involved taking a moment to consider how each battle would affect my resources on hand. There’s nothing that I love more than saying hello to a Phantom with a loud gun, but in most cases (as I fail to illustrate below) I valued having a fat stack of reserve materials a little more.

The power of choice

Neuromods also help you even-out the fight against the Typhon. Shortly after you begin the journey, Morgan can learn new perks with these collectable items that can be used to unlock new abilities and upgrades to your suit’s capabilities.



Want to boost your strength, hack terminals and double your health gauge? Enjoy being stealthy? There’s a perk for that. Additionally, there are chipsets sprinkled throughout the campaign that give your suit some specialized powers, like the ability to see hidden mimics and granting you higher chances of landing critical blows with your favorite weapon, and more.

As such, the skill tree presented here allows for surprisingly deep customization, even allowing Morgan to take on certain traits of the Typhon to gain a considerable edge in combat. Abilities like shape-shifting, teleporting and mind-hacking really broaden the playbook when they become available around halfway through the journey. However, there are some interesting implications at stake for adopting the enemy’s ways.

To hunt and to be hunted

I have a confession to make: it took me a while to not suck at Prey. A common scenario involved being ambushed by a lowly Mimic while it was disguised as a mug. Effortlessly juking around the room, it avoided my every swing of a wrench. Having drained all of my stamina, I realize that I am the prey, owned by the easiest enemy in the game.



While I did become more proficient later on, the wild enemy patterns are tougher to read than they seem. To that end, I appreciate that this game enforces learning through failures and plotting out your attack, even when it’s just a casual encounter with a relatively harmless enemy.



In the end, the harsh, but fair difficulty made applying learned battle tactics to each Typhon encounter during my bleak tenure on Talos 1 one of the more rewarding things I’ve done in a game this year.



Prey is a captivating exploration of how far humans will go to sustain their species, even at the cost of their own lives or others. While it suffers from poor pacing at times and a few quality of life issues, this game more than makes up for it with surprising depth in its story, an incredible atmosphere and an open-ended approach that caters to casual and more hardcore gamers alike.

Arkane has crafted one of my favorite experiences of 2017.

Verdict: Play it now

Prey was reviewed on the PC with code provided by Bethesda.

10,TCL eyes the throne as one of the world's top TV makers,"“It can be overwhelming to walk into a retailer and see all the TVs on the wall. All their settings are cranked up to compete with one another,” Chris Larson, Senior Vice President, TCL tells us at a recent briefing held at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, Calif.

The discussion was about how TCL TVs … well, all TVs really, are calibrated differently for stores than they are for your home. It’s a trick TV manufacturers have been using for years – turning saturation levels up to sickening levels while cranking the brightness up to its maximum level. It’s intense, definitely, and more than a little deceitful.

But let’s not focus on that god-awful practice for a minute. Let’s focus on the wall of TVs.

For anyone who knows the difference between a composite and component cable, this wall is a visual chocolate factory – each television offering a different flavor of eye candy. We love walking into a Best Buy or Tesco to see what’s new in the world of pixels and panels. We comment on how this LG OLED might look better than Samsung’s new QLED screen, at least in terms of contrast, and quibble over whether Android TV is the best or the worst thing to ever happen to televisions in the last century.

But for others, like my parents, this section of the store – and in particular this wall of TVs – is nothing but a bunch of seemingly identical screens. Who makes a better OLED really isn’t on their list of concerns. I’ve tried to explain Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision, HDR and dozens of other technologies over the years to my parents and, honestly, they’re not interested. As long as the TV looks good and doesn’t cost much, they’re happy.

If you want to know how TCL (an acronym that at one point stood for True China Lion) became the third largest TV manufacturer in the world, it’s through people like my parents.

Quality, performance and value

Sorry, that last bit makes it sound like TCL doesn’t make very good TVs. They do. I mean, they’re not exceptional in the same way the LG Signature Series W7 OLED or the Samsung Q9F QLED TV are, but they’re quite good – especially now that they support Dolby Vision.

The reason for my visit to Dolby Labs was to check out TCL’s 2017 line-up. Two series from last year are getting a refresh (the P- and S-Series) while TCL is introducing a completely new line called the C-Series that taps into contemporary aesthetics and adds support for most HDR sources.

These TVs look good and, according to Larson, will also be priced fairly. If you’re looking for a way to help differentiate TCL from the masses of TVs on the aforementioned wall, it’s their brand promise: Delivering uncompromised experiences at a recognized value with an attractive cosmetic.

It’s a promise that seems to be harder and harder to keep every year now that new Chinese TV makers like Hisense and LeEco have moved into the market. To me, this seems like something worth fretting over, but it didn’t seem to scare anyone in that office.

Oprah might give away cars, but Ellen's got TVs covered.

Larsen told me there were already branding programs in place to help make TCL a household name. “We have a partnership with the Ellen Show and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Plus, we acquired the TCL Chinese Theater down in L.A.” Other ties include UCLA athletic teams, the San Jose Earthquakes (a MLS team based in Northern California) and the Rose Bowl, one of the biggest football games in the NCAA.

And while the list is impressive, I’m not sure a few sponsorship deals will be enough to beat out the most ubiquitous names in television like Sony, Samsung and LG – each of whom have a long and storied career in American families’ living rooms. But maybe it will be.

The grand plan

So what’s the end goal here? If TCL got this far in the TV world without an insane amount of brand recognition, why does it want to change anything?

According to Larsen, it's easy to sell smaller value TVs. It’s a crowded market, sure, but in the end value always beats out performance. But being the main screen in the house? That’s much, much harder. To get to the coveted center of the home you’ve not only got to look good in terms of picture quality and cost less than everyone else, but you need a decent design aesthetic, too.

And according to Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL, that’s where this year’s all new C-Series come in.

The new series will go on sale in late June and combines “contemporary design” (Dew’s words) and the latest in 4K HDR technology. As far as operating systems go, the TVs use Roku OS 7.5 – a close relative of the operating system used on Roku streaming boxes like the Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere+ and Roku Express.

The C-Series will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch versions and will include both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (HLG is something TCL is looking into, but not actively including on any TV this year.) They'll feature wide color gamut with advanced LED phosphor for more realistic colors, brighter highlights and increased light-to-dark contrast and support almost 100% of the DCI-P3 color space.

I left the demo impressed with what I saw. The Dolby Vision integration helped add some pizzazz to TCL’s panels, while Roku OS provided a familiar face that I knew could help me find the content I’ve been looking for.

And yet, I couldn’t help but think back to that wall.

When TCL’s latest series make it to showrooms in late June, will my parents be blown away by Dolby Vision? Will they care that the 2017 P-Series now has 72 Contrast Control Zones that increase contrast and clarity? Maybe. Maybe not.

But considering that TCL’s 55-inch C-Series TV, the 55C807, goes for $699 (around £540, AU$950), I guess it doesn’t matter.",techradar
6,OnPolitics Today: Trump contradicted himself on the Comey firing,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Trump said FBI Director James Comey was fired because of the Clinton email investigation but later contradicted himself. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Two days. That's how long it took for President Donald Trump to upend his own administration's rationale behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the fallout from which continued to engulf Washington on Thursday.

In a letter Trump sent to Comey on Tuesday, the president wrote that he fired the director based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But in an interview Thursday with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump claimed that Sessions and Rosenstein didn't influence his decision at all. Trump had already made up his mind.

""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" said Trump, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander.""

It's OnPolitics Today, the new daily politics roundup from USA TODAY. Subscribe here.

Some key folks disagree with Trump's characterization of Comey

Trump said this week that he fired Comey because he was ""not doing a good job,"" telling Holt in his Thursday interview that ""the FBI has been in turmoil.""

You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,"" Trump said. ""You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago, it hasn't recovered from that.""

Except everyone does not know that, including Andrew McCabe, the FBI's new acting director. The White House said this week that Comey had lost the confidence of the bureau, a claim McCabe contradicted on Thursday when speaking to a Senate committee. “The vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,” McCabe said, which continues ""to this day.""

The firing of Comey, McCabe said, would not deter the FBI's investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia: ""Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing.""

Republican Richard Burr, the North Carolina senator chairing the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Comey "" the most ethical, upstanding individual I’ve had the pleasure to work with.""

And, for what it's worth, a new online poll from NBC News found that a slight majority of Americans — 54% — don't think Comey's sudden firing was appropriate.

So about Rod Rosenstein

The deputy attorney general is getting an invite from senators to brief them about his role in Comey's firing. According to Politico, Rosenstein reached out to Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about meeting amid reports that he was ""furious"" about the White House's characterization of his recommendation that allegedly caused Comey's firing.

Democrat and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer asked Rosenstein more than two dozen questions in a letter on Thursday, including whether Comeys' firing came days after he asked for more resources for the FBI's Russia inquiry, as has been widely reported.

The all-senators briefing with Rosentein is slated for next week, according to a spokesman Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Russia reportedly tricked Trump's White House

Optics be damned, Trump met with top Russian diplomats on Wednesday, the day after firing the man overseeing the FBI's investigation into his own campaign and Russia. In a move both surprising and not, all media was barred from the meeting except one Russia-owned news agency. Photos soon surfaced of a beaming Donald Trump with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the man who's caused much of Trump's Russia-related headaches through his communications with Trump associates, including now-fired adviser Michael Flynn.

CNN reported Thursday that the White House is furious over release of the photos, claiming the Russians ""tricked us.""

Spoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Thursday's episode of The Big Bang Theory.

For someone who often seems immune to basic human emotions, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) showed impressive dramatic flair with his marriage proposal in Thursday’s Season 10 finale of The Big Bang Theory.

The socially awkward genius impulsively flew from California to New Jersey to drop to his knee and offer an engagement ring to girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who had just started a fellowship at Princeton. In true cliffhanger mode, fans will have to wait until fall to find out Amy’s answer.

Sheldon has had the ring and thoughts of marriage for some time, but it's a romantic kiss from a returning admirer, Dr. Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), that compels him to act. He immediately leaves the office, heads to the airport, flies across the country and proposes as Amy opens her apartment door.

“We like to end the season finales on something intriguing, and we found ourselves enjoying the idea that while Amy was away another woman made a play for Sheldon,” says executive producer Steven Molaro. “Those pieces started to fit together.

“The season finale is a real pivotal moment for Sheldon and Amy,” he says. “When we shot that (proposal) scene, everybody was on stage, (including) the actors who weren’t in the scene. It was emotionally important for us to be part of it. And the studio audience just lost their minds.”

Parsons says he was surprised — but not completely — when he read the scene in the script. Sheldon has been advancing, slowly but surely, over the seasons: dating Amy, entering a committed relationship and losing his virginity with her. This season, they started living together.

Parsons spoke with Bialik about Sheldon’s motivation in proposing.

“The way it was instigated through this woman who came back into his life, there’s something very interesting that he was motivated by that,” he says. “He didn’t need a reminder that he missed (Amy). … Both of us wondered if he wasn’t trying to squash some weird feeling that he was uncomfortable with.”

Molaro, the top-rated sitcom’s head writer, says he’s not fully locked in on how Amy will respond when Bang returns for an eleventh season in the fall.

“On paper, it makes sense that she would say yes, but it’s a little complicated,” he says. “I have versions of the answer that are playing out in my head for us to talk about in the writers room. I think it’s good for a show when we pull the trigger on these momentous events even when we don’t know if we’re fully ready for it. It keeps it exciting.”

Parsons, like Sheldon, awaits Amy’s answer.

“I will be curious to see where it heads. This could be pretty straightforward,” he muses, before pausing. “Well, that’s not going to be true. Even if they go through with the wedding, there will be something weird about it.”

9,"Spurs eliminate James Harden, Rockets in Game 6 rout","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The San Antonio Spurs and Golden State Warriors held the two best records in the regular season, and will now face off in the Western Conference Finals. USA TODAY Sports

Mike D’Antoni is a realist.

So when the Houston Rockets head coach took a step back to evaluate this Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, he wasn’t afraid to speak some truth.

“It could be said that (the Spurs) should win,” D’Antoni told USA TODAY Sports last week before Game 3. “They’re better than us right now. We’re a little bit ahead in our progression.”

Except for one thing: He said that when Kawhi Leonard was actually playing.

The Leonard-less Spurs handed the Rockets a humiliating end to their surprise season on Thursday night at the Toyota Center, closing out the series with a 114-75 win that pits them against the vaunted Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals that will start on Sunday. With Leonard sidelined by a left ankle injury suffered in Game 5, his much-maligned co-star, 31-year-old forward LaMarcus Aldridge, had just the sort of game the Spurs had in mind when they added him in free agency in the summer of 2015.

""He's been like that through these first two rounds,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said after the win. ""He's really turned it on and demanded the ball.""

Latest NBA coverage:

The final inspired line: 34 points on 16 of 26 shooting to go with 12 rebounds. It was Aldridge’s best offensive game since May 2, 2016 when he scored 41 points in a playoff win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. More than that, it was the latest reminder that the Spurs aren’t going away anytime soon.

They lost Tim Duncan to retirement last summer, then saw veteran point guard Tony Parker go down with a season-ending quadriceps tendon tear in Game 2. The lone remaining member of their old-school trio, 39-year-old Manu Ginobili, pulled off a vintage performance in Game 5 that brought them to this point.

One game after his game-saving block on James Harden, with Harden himself having a disastrous finish (10 points on two of 11 shooting, seven assists, three rebounds, and six turnovers), the Spurs turned to their younger crew.

""I don't know what it was,"" Harden said. ""I know they played well, and we didn't.""

San Antonio rookie point guard DeJounte Murray gave them 11 points, 10 rebounds and five assists off the bench (good for a plus-33 mark). Jonathon Simmons, the 27-year-old point guard who played his way to the Spurs through the NBA Development League, added 18 points on eight of 12 shooting.

""It happens,"" D'Antoni said. ""I just told the guys, they had an unbelievable year. ... We'll figure that out and get better this summer and then come back and do it again. It was a pleasure coaching them. They tried to do everything they could to make it a great year. I'm proud to be their coach. I know they feel as bad as I do.""

It would have been one thing for the Rockets to fall in this series with both sides at full strength, a respectable finish after their surprise campaign in which they had the league’s third-best record just one season after sneaking into the playoffs as the Western Conference’s eighth seed. After all, only the Warriors were better than the Spurs (61-21) this season. But this? It was as bad as season-ending exits get.

6,Comey gets the 'United' treatment on 'New Yorker' cover,"The cover for the May 22 edition of 'The New Yorker' depicts former FBI director James Comey being dragged off a flight by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Photo: Barry Blitt, The New Yorker)

The New Yorker, long been known for its comedic covers that flirt with controversy, is taking on the firing of FBI Director James Comey and in the process comparing it to the outrage-inspiring story of the man who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight.

The cover for the May 22 issue of the magazine shows a complacent Comey being dragged down the aisle of a plane by Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is wearing a police uniform. Looking over his shoulder is the plane's captain, President Trump.

""It’s probably a bit of a leap,"" said artist Barry Blitt about his drawing for the cover, which is titled Ejected. ""James Comey is six feet eight — he probably would have been happy to give up his seat in a cramped cabin.""

An early look at next week's cover, “Ejected,” by Barry Blitt: https://t.co/HJUOYaH8qkpic.twitter.com/kCAqsAOUn5 — The New Yorker (@NewYorker) May 11, 2017

The cover instantly evokes the April 9 incident in which David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., doctor, refused to give up his seat on United flight after being involuntarily bumped. Police yanked Dao from his seat and dragged him off the plane, giving him a concussion and two lost teeth in the process.

Both the United incident and the Comey firing sparked waves of public outrage. It remains to be seen if the outcry over Comey will prove as ephemeral as that which followed Dao's rough removal.

6,Poll: Majority of Americans don't think Comey firing was appropriate,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A timeline of events that led up to President Donald Trump abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey in the midst of the agency's investigation into whether Trump's presidential campaign was connected to Russian meddling in the election. (May 10) AP

A majority of Americans don't believe President Trump's sudden firing of James Comey was appropriate, according to a new poll.

The NBC News and SurveyMonkey online poll found that 54% of Americans believed Comey's dismissal was inappropriate, while 38% thought it was appropriate.

The poll was released the same day that Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he had planned to fire Comey ""regardless of (the Justice Department's) recommendation.""

The White House had previously asserted that Comey was fired based on the recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who lambasted Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

However, according to the survey, 46% of Americans believe that Comey was fired because he is overseeing an FBI investigation into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the presidential election.

A 24% faction believe it was because of the Clinton email investigation. Another 22% said the firing was because of something else.

Even though Americans are clearly suspicious of Trump's motives for firing Comey, they don't necessarily like the former FBI director. About 4 out of 10 Americans (44%) said they did not approve of how Comey did his job as FBI director. Only 25% said they approved, and another 28% said they didn't know enough to say.

Comey's recent tenure has been marked by two widely publicized probes – and he didn't get high approval ratings for how he handled either of them. Comey made the unusual decision of coming out in July to announce he was not recommending prosecution against Clinton for her use of a private email server during secretary of State, only to announce he was reopening the probe just 11 days before the November election.

The poll found Comey had a low, 19% approval rating for how he handled the Clinton email probe. Another 57% said they disapproved of his handling of that investigation.

Comey earlier this year announced the FBI was in the middle of a full blown counterintelligence investigation into whether there was any collusion between Russia and Trump campaign associates. Only 34% of Americans said they approved of how he was handling the Russia investigation, while 27% disapproved.

Still, following Comey's ouster, a majority of people (55%) said they were now less confident that the Russia investigation would be fairly conducted. Comparably, 36% said it made them more confident.

A majority of people (54%) said they believed that the alleged contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials is a serious issue. Another 40% said it was more of a distraction.

The poll was conducted online from May 10 to May 11 among a national sample of 3,746 adults.

16,‘Purge’ killer given 3 life sentences,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A killer who said he was inspired by the ""Purge"" movies, was sentenced to three life sentences after a three-day rampage in May 2016 that led to the murder of three Indianapolis men. Dwight Adams/IndyStar

Johnathan Cruz (Photo: Provided by IMPD)

INDIANAPOLIS — Billy Boyd was killed one year ago Friday, as he walked home to care for his father with prostate cancer, his family says. He did not live to see the birth of his first grandchild. His father died shortly after him.

Three days later, Jose Ruiz was shot and killed. His daughter still has nightmares, his niece testified. His 18-year-old son has put off going to college.

""You could always call Billy in the middle of the night,"" his sister, Jennifer Darby, testified Thursday afternoon at the sentencing for her brother's killer, wiping away tears

Family members for 44-year-old Ruiz, 54-year-old Boyd and 40-year-old Jay Higginbotham crowded into the courtroom, sharing their pain and grief in the wake of the senseless rampage committed last year in the name of the horror film The Purge.

Marion Superior Judge Sheila Carlisle sentenced Johnathan S. Cruz, 20, of Indianapolis to three consecutive life sentences without parole for shooting and killing the three men in a three-day span last May. She also sentenced him to 16 years in prison for robbery, which will be served alongside the life sentences.

Cruz previously faced three murder charges and a slew of robbery, intimidation and gun charges. Marion County prosecutors in July notified the court the state would seek the death penalty in the case due to the allegation that Cruz killed three people in the commission of a robbery.

Last month, Cruz pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and one count of robbery. In exchange, prosecutors dropped the other charges and agreed not to pursue the death penalty.

Susan Leon, a niece of Ruiz, said her uncle was a father, husband, friend and godfather to many.

""If you needed anything, you could turn to him,"" she said.

“We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend. We've never seen this.” Terry Curry, Marion County prosecutor

Family members of Higginbotham declined to speak at the hearing, but noted for the court that they approved of the plea agreement.

After the hearing, Darby said many members of her family supported a life sentence from the beginning. She said she does not believe in the death penalty.

Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said his office took into account the defendant's possible mental health problems when considering the plea agreement.

""This individual spending the rest of his life in prison is gratifying,"" Curry said. ""He is 20 years old. His life is effectively over.""

The killing spree, according to court documents, was modeled after the horror film in which the U.S. government designates a 12-hour period where all crimes, including murder, are legal.

To witnesses, Cruz described his violent spree as a ""purge,"" court documents say. Investigators believed it was related to criminal gang activity.

""We see things every week that are difficult to comprehend,"" Curry said. ""We've never seen this.""

Nicole Kidman is one tough food critic, not afraid to tell you when your pizza just isn't cutting it. She'll even spit it out, on live television.

Both Kidman and Ellen DeGeneres had a tough time chewing through celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis' clementine and fennel focaccia bread pizza during a cooking demonstration on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday.

As Ellen soldiered on during the tasting, chomping on the hard bread, Kidman vocalized her thoughts, before literally taking the pizza out of her mouth.

""It's a little tough. I know you're not meant to criticize. But it's a little tough,"" said Kidman, ""Don't let my kids see I did that.""

The sight almost caused DeGeneres to choke on her food.

A laughing De Laurentiis pointed out, ""It's been sitting there for like five hours.""

The Ellen cooking demonstration is classic television. De Laurentiis, promoting her 13th season of Food Network Star, started off the segment teaching the duo how to make arancini balls out of leftover risotto. That brings about a flurry of ""ball"" double-entendres.

The trio laughed it up all the while as an Ellen producer kept urging them to move along.

""Isn't it meant to be relaxing?"" Kidman said at one point.

Colin Kaepernick is still a quarterback without a job, but there apparently are still teams in the NFL that are curious about his prospects.

Harry Edwards, the renowned sociologist who has been an adviser to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, told USA TODAY Sports that three teams have contacted him about Kaepernick since the free agency period opened in March.

This, amid speculation that Kaepernick, 29, is being blackballed after igniting a movement last season when he protested police brutality and racial inequalities by refusing to stand for the national anthem.

“They’ve asked, ‘Can he play? Does he want to play?’ “ Edwards said. “The last question I can’t answer. The first question, absolutely. If Kaep makes up his mind, he wouldn’t only go in and make a team, he’d put pressure on somebody to start.”

MORE COVERAGE:

It is certainly baffling, from a football sense, that a man with a Super Bowl start on his resume hasn’t been offered as much as a backup slot in a league with a dearth of quarterback talent. Even Blaine Gabbert, who was benched last season when Kaepernick returned to the starting lineup, has a new job. Gabbert signed with the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday.

Kaepernick, meanwhile, hasn’t been publicly linked to any team. Although Kaepernick has been seen publicly while engaged in some charity causes during the offseason, he hasn’t commented on his football prospects. Edwards, also a consultant to the 49ers, wouldn’t reveal which teams contacted him and said that he hasn’t spoken to Kaepernick since he opted out of his San Francisco contract.

Is Kaepernick’s lack of opportunity essentially backlash for his protests?

“I don’t think there’s any question that there are some owners who wouldn’t have him in the league, much less on their team,” Edwards said. “But I fully expect one (team to sign him), because it’s in the best interest of the league to have him on a team.

“You can’t have a league that’s approaching 80% black, and then say it you stand up and say anything relevant to these issues – especially in the age of (President) Trump – this is what happens to you. You can’t do that. You can’t just up and right off black protests as if this were 1950.”

In March, ESPN reported that Kaepernick would resume standing for the anthem. Yet that apparently hardly moved the needle on his market appeal.

If he doesn’t wind up with a team, Edwards suggests that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell find a position for Kaepernick at league headquarters.

“I want to hear what he thinks and what he has to say about what’s going on in the league,” Edwards said.

Of course, the best-case scenario is to hear from Kaepernick while he also has the chance to demonstrate that he can still play in the NFL, too.

4,This Dog Is A Tad Embarrassed By His Mom's Birthday Celebration For Him And It's So Cute,"Matt Buechele

Currently, Carson's hobbies are going on walks and eating sliders at Arby's, one of his humans, Matt Buechele, told BuzzFeed News.

9,James Harden’s Game 6 choke job was the defining moment of his career,"What was that?

No, seriously, what was that?

Because by the looks of it, it appears that James Harden, one of the favorites to win the MVP award this year, followed up his terrible clutch performance in Game 5 with an even worse Game 6.

An all-time bad Game 6.

A performance so woeful, so puzzling, that it has to go down as the defining moment of Harden’s season.

9,Dana White sets deadline for Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather negotiations | FOX Sports,"UFC president Dana White is ready to either get the deal done for Conor McGregor to face off with Floyd Mayweather, or he’s walking away from the negotiating table altogether.

White has stated for weeks that he was going to do everything in his power to get the fight done that would see the current UFC lightweight champion likely pocket a paycheck that could potentially exceed $75 million for the matchup with Mayweather.

According to White, his plan was to sit down with McGregor following the birth of his child, which took place last weekend, and now it appears he plans on speaking to the Irish fighter on Sunday to hammer out a deal.

White told Jim Rome on Thursday that he’s hoping to wrap up McGregor’s part of the negotiations on Sunday before then moving on to deal with Mayweather’s camp starting on Monday.

“I plan on having this thing locked up by this Sunday and then moving on to Team Mayweather and starting a negotiation with them. If we really do get it done in that time frame, then this thing could possibly happen,” White said.

“But again, I still need to go negotiate with [Floyd Mayweather’s team]. There’s no guarantee that we’re going to come to a deal.”

The flipside is White also stating that if he can’t reach an agreement with McGregor on financial terms on Sunday then he’s calling a stop to the negotiations and moving on from the fight completely.

White said Sunday is “absolutely” his deadline to get a deal done with McGregor but he’s feeling “pretty good” about coming to an agreement with the UFC lightweight champion.

“Hopefully, Monday I’m going to sit down to negotiate with Team Mayweather,” White teased.

McGregor and Mayweather have been flirting with this matchup for more than a year, but it appeared in recent months that the fight was actually going to come together.

The sticking point has always been the financial stakes for McGregor and Mayweather with both fighters claiming to be the larger draw in the matchup, which would mean a bigger piece of the lucrative pay-per-view pie that would undoubtedly earn a ton of money.

White promised McGregor that he would do everything in his power to get the deal done but the sand in the hourglass is nearly running out with the UFC president setting a deadline when he’s walking away from the table.

By all accounts, it appears White will know by Monday if he’s one step closer towards making the fight a reality or putting a nail in the coffin for this long-rumored matchup once and for all.

“Yeah I just can’t keep messing with this thing,” White said. “I need to run my business and I have to focus on all the other things that are going on around here.”",fox-sports

""And it was funny, Skip. I was just thinking about him yesterday, and out of a blue a text popped up. Guess who it was from? Kaep.

""He said ‘I appreciate you setting the record straight about money, about what I would or wouldn’t accept. Because no one has contacted me or my representative.’

""Now there’s been all this speculation that he wanted $9 million. All this speculation that he can’t accept being a backup.

9,How to fix the Houston Rockets in 3 easy steps | FOX Sports,"Year One of the Mike D'Antoni era in Houston went better than anyone expected, but the Rockets' impressive 2016-17 season came to an ignoble end in Game 6 against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday.

Without Kawhi Leonard on the floor to check James Harden, Houston still rolled over and lost by 39 points at home in an elimination game.

While it wasn't the greatest way to go out this season, the Rockets can take solace in the fact they're a team on the rise. They don't need to make any earth-shaking adjustments; they just need to trust their process and make a few changes to turn the modern version of D'Antoni's Suns into a team that can compete for a title.

Here are three ways the Rockets can improve this offseason.",fox-sports
9,Spurs embarrass Rockets by 39 points without Kawhi Leonard in Game 6 closeout win | FOX Sports,"That’s right: 39 points.

There was always the chance for a blowout when the San Antonio Spurs decided to sit Kawhi Leonard for Game 6 against the Houston Rockets. We just didn’t expect the Spurs to be the team delivering the thrashing.

Thanks to one of the worst nights of James Harden’s career and a much-needed big game from LaMarcus Aldridge, though, the Spurs eliminated the Rockets from the 2017 NBA playoffs with a 114-75 beatdown.

This pretty much sums up the night in Houston. #SCtop10 pic.twitter.com/OWKfaLekhS — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) May 12, 2017

Aldridge finished with 34 points on 16-for-26 shooting and 12 rebounds, while Jonathon Simmons added 18 points and four assists for San Antonio. Harden went 2-for-11 from the field, scoring 11 points and dishing seven assists in an embarrassing loss that had many questioning his MVP credentials.

The defeat is particularly irksome for Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni, who is now 5-20 in the postseason against Popovich, having lost all five series between the two.

Leonard missed Game 6 due to an ankle injury he suffered in the second half of San Antonio’s overtime Game 5 victory, as the Spurs had the luxury of a potential Game 7 at home on Sunday if they lost on Thursday night.

Instead, San Antonio will tip off the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors, who swept their second-round series against the Utah Jazz, on Sunday in Oakland.",fox-sports
9,Yair Rodriguez explains why he can be a bigger star than Canelo Alvarez in Mexico | FOX Sports,"As the UFC continues to expand into Latin America, featherweight contender Yair Rodriguez would like to become the new face of the promotion in Mexico with hopes to even surpass Saul “Canelo” Alvarez as the biggest combat sports star in his home country.

Now that might sound like very lofty aspirations considering Alvarez has become one of the biggest sports stars in all of Mexico while also becoming a real draw for the sport of boxing.

Alvarez’s most recent fight against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. reportedly sold around one million pay-per-views, which is a massive landmark for the 26-year old Mexican boxer.

Now Rodriguez makes it clear that he has no ill will towards his fellow countryman whatsoever, but he still believes in the long term that he could become an even bigger draw for the Mexican faithful than what “Canelo” is currently pulling for his fights.

“He became a big star. Well why him being Mexican and being a fighter, can I not become a big star in Mexico? Why not? It doesn’t make any sense for me when people ask me,” Rodriguez explained when speaking to FOX Sports. “Why not?

“If I become a champion, if I become the first Mexican UFC champion, I can become bigger because I will be the first one. There are already a lot of Mexican boxers, great boxers. I’m not saying Canelo is not great. He’s great. But I think I can become bigger than that because I’ll be the first one.”

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports

Lofty goals indeed for Rodriguez but there’s no lack of confidence in the surging featherweight star ahead of his next fight at UFC 211 this weekend.

To remain on his path to become the first ever Mexican born UFC champion, Rodriguez will have to get past Frankie Edgar on Saturday night and that’s no easy task.

Edgar has sat atop two divisions during different stages in his UFC career while currently being ranked No. 2 at featherweight sitting behind only champion Jose Aldo and interim champion Max Holloway. In fact, Edgar has only been defeated by Aldo since moving down to 145 pounds while racking up wins over every other fighter he’s faced including stoppages over Cub Swanson and Chad Mendes.

Despite that resume, Rodriguez not only believes that he can beat Edgar at UFC 211, but he wants to add another career first to his record as well.

He wants to be the first person to hand Edgar a loss by knockout.

“I think he’s never fought a guy like me,” Rodriguez said about Edgar. “Everybody thinks I’m fast, but they don’t know how fast I am until they fight me. Whenever they fight me, they can never find me. I think Frankie Edgar has the potential for me to knock him out because the way that he moves and he’s short. I like to fight short guys because my range helps me out a lot. So I think it’s just because of that.”

As much as the hype around this fight centers around Rodriguez taking a big step up in competition to face a former champion like Edgar, he refuses to acknowledge that this matchup is any tougher than the others he’s faced in the past.

It’s not that Rodriguez doesn’t see Edgar as a threat, but instead he prefers to focus on what he’s doing to get ready for the fight rather than putting any opponent on a pedestal.

“For me it’s just one more fight. With all respect to him, he’s just one more fight for me,” Rodriguez said. “I treated B.J. Penn the same, I treated Alex Caceres the same, I treat any fighter the same. It doesn’t matter. Because for me, they’re just a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re the champion or not. For me, that doesn’t matter. I’m going to treat you the same because you are a human being.

“You have a brain, you have a heart, you have two arms and two legs. You train just like me. It doesn’t matter where you think you are. I’m going to treat you the same.”",fox-sports
9,Joanna Jedrzejczyk wants to be a two-division champion just like Conor McGregor | FOX Sports,"The addition of the women’s flyweight division later this year has Joanna Jedrzejczyk contemplating a chance to make history sooner rather than later.

The reigning and defending women’s strawweight champion has flirted with the idea of moving up to 125 pounds previously but now that the UFC is set to crown the first ever champion in the division later this year, it’s now becoming a reality.

While Jedrzejczyk is laser focused on her title fight this weekend against Jessica Andrade at UFC 211, she can’t ignore the possibility of winning a second world title while joining Conor McGregor as the only simultaneous two division champions in UFC history.

“Maybe next year, I will fight for the second belt. Why not? It’s a big challenge, probably the challenge of my life. We will see,” Jedrzejczyk said on Thursday in Dallas.

Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

Of course, Jedrzejczyk expects to get the same blowback that McGregor received when he began serious pursuit of a second world title while already reigning as champion in a different division.

As McGregor went through two fights with Nate Diaz before finally facing Eddie Alvarez last November for the lightweight title, the featherweight division where he was also champion sat somewhat stagnant as contenders were all hoping for a shot at him.

Jedrzejczyk understands that argument, but she also wants to live out her dreams and goals and nothing would taste sweeter than becoming the first woman in UFC history to hold two titles at the same time.

“I remember when I was talking about this division a year ago people were like ‘focus on your belt’. I’m going for my fifth title defense. That’s the thing, why not? I have bigger, bigger goals and dreams. If I don’t win this second belt, nothing is going to happen because like I said, I already reached my goals and dreams, but there is something better coming,” Jedrzejczyk said.

“People were saying the same to Conor [McGregor] when he was saying he wants to be a king in two different divisions. Same with me. I just want to challenge myself and this is what I’m doing in my life.”

Of course, McGregor promised that he would eventually defend both titles but he never got the chance when the UFC stripped him of the featherweight belt less than a month after becoming a two division champion.

While she can’t predict the future, Jedrzejczyk believes she could stay busy and active enough to defend both titles if she’s fortunate enough to win a championship at 125 pounds.

“If I became a champion [at] 125, I will be jump between 115 and 125,” Jedrzejczyk said. “I want to be the real champion of two different divisions.”",fox-sports
9,Spurs star Kawhi Leonard will not play in Game 6 against the Rockets | FOX Sports,"The San Antonio Spurs will not have Kawhi Leonard in the lineup Thursday against the Houston Rockets in a potential series closeout game. Leonard, who suffered an ankle injury in the Spurs’ Game 5 victory, missed all of the fourth quarter and overtime in Tuesday’s 110-107 win.

Per Coach Pop, Kawhi Leonard will not play tonight — San Antonio Spurs (@spurs) May 11, 2017

Jonathan Simmons will start in Leonard’s place. Leonard, who is averaging 23.8 points, 9.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists in the series, played 38 minutes and finished with 22 points and 15 rebounds Tuesday as the Spurs took a 3-2 lead.

The Spurs were already shorthanded before losing Leonard as starting point guard Tony Parker was ruled out for the rest of the season after rupturing a quad in Game 2 of the series.

3,Zika virus: Brazil says emergency is over,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The virus has been linked to microcephaly, or abnormally small heads

Brazil has declared an end to a national emergency over the Zika virus after a sharp decrease in cases.

The number of cases dropped 95% between January and April, compared to the same period a year ago, officials said.

The virus has been linked to the birth of babies with abnormally small heads. The threat was at its peak as Brazil prepared to host the 2016 Olympics.

The World Health Organisation lifted its own international emergency in November last year.

The Zika virus has been linked to severe birth defects in almost 30 countries.

Brazil had declared a national emergency in November 2015. The threat led to a campaign to eradicate the mosquitoes which carry the virus.

There were 7,911 cases of Zika from January to April this year, compared to 170,535 cases reported in the same time last year, the health ministry said in a statement (in Portuguese).

No deaths related to the virus have been reported this year, it added, saying that eight people died last year.

Some people might be a little bummed to be called a ""no-talent guy"" by the President of the United States.

But not when it's talk-show host Stephen Colbert dealing with an attack by President Trump.

Colbert was positively giddy on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Thursday night after Trump gave the insult — and more — during a Time magazine interview.

""The President of the United States has personally come after me and my show. And there's only one thing to say,"" said Colbert, happily clapping his hands together during the show's opening. ""Yayyyyyyy!""

The crowd started yelling ""Stephen, Stephen"" as Colbert mouthed ""I love you"" to Trump through the TV camera.

""Mr. Trump. There's a lot you don't understand,"" Colbert added. ""But I never thought one of those things would be show business. Don't you know, I've been trying for a year to get you to say my name. And you were very restrained, admirably restrained. But now you did it.""

Then Colbert could only whisper as he pointed to himself: ""I won!""

Colbert further capitalized on the public relations bonanza by tweeting about Trump before the show:

Trump talked smack about me in TIME mag. If only I had a nightly show to respond on...oh yeah, I do! Join us, won't you? 11:35 #briarpatch — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) May 12, 2017

""Trump talked smack about me in TIME mag. If only I had a nightly show to respond on...oh yeah, I do! Join us, won't you?"" Colbert wrote on Twitter.

Colbert has leveled a series of blistering attacks on Trump during his show, including one so fierce and off-color it lead to the hashtag #FireColbert. The talk-show host has also picked up a substantial ratings increase with his nightly skewering of the Trump presidency.

Trump finally slammed him back in the Time interview:

""You see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There’s nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying. I’ve done his show. … But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high—highest rating. The highest rating he’s ever had.""

16,'Big Bang Theory' season finale: Did Sheldon really  pop the question?,"Sheldon (Jim Parsons), right, pops the question to Amy (Mayim Bialik) at the end of the Season 10 finale of CBS's 'The Big Bang Theory.' (Photo: Michael Yarish, Warner Bros. Entertainment)

For someone who often seems immune to basic human emotions, Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) showed impressive dramatic flair with his marriage proposal in Thursday’s Season 10 finale of The Big Bang Theory.

The socially awkward genius impulsively flew from California to New Jersey to drop to his knee and offer an engagement ring to girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik), who had just started a fellowship at Princeton. In true cliffhanger mode, fans will have to wait until fall to find out Amy’s answer.

Sheldon has had the ring and thoughts of marriage for some time, but it's a romantic kiss from a returning admirer, Dr. Ramona Nowitzki (Riki Lindhome), that compels him to act. He immediately leaves the office, heads to the airport, flies across the country and proposes as Amy opens her apartment door.

“We like to end the season finales on something intriguing, and we found ourselves enjoying the idea that while Amy was away another woman made a play for Sheldon,” says executive producer Steven Molaro. “Those pieces started to fit together.

“The season finale is a real pivotal moment for Sheldon and Amy,” he says. “When we shot that (proposal) scene, everybody was on stage, (including) the actors who weren’t in the scene. It was emotionally important for us to be part of it. And the studio audience just lost their minds.”

Parsons says he was surprised — but not completely — when he read the scene in the script. Sheldon has been advancing, slowly but surely, over the seasons: dating Amy, entering a committed relationship and losing his virginity with her. This season, they started living together.

Parsons spoke with Bialik about Sheldon’s motivation in proposing.

“The way it was instigated through this woman who came back into his life, there’s something very interesting that he was motivated by that,” he says. “He didn’t need a reminder that he missed (Amy). … Both of us wondered if he wasn’t trying to squash some weird feeling that he was uncomfortable with.”

Molaro, the top-rated sitcom’s head writer, says he’s not fully locked in on how Amy will respond when Bang returns for an eleventh season in the fall.

“On paper, it makes sense that she would say yes, but it’s a little complicated,” he says. “I have versions of the answer that are playing out in my head for us to talk about in the writers room. I think it’s good for a show when we pull the trigger on these momentous events even when we don’t know if we’re fully ready for it. It keeps it exciting.”

Parsons, like Sheldon, awaits Amy’s answer.

“I will be curious to see where it heads. This could be pretty straightforward,” he muses, before pausing. “Well, that’s not going to be true. Even if they go through with the wedding, there will be something weird about it.”

6,Trump's anger could lead down a dangerous road,"(CNN) Presidents often get angry, but most go to great lengths to hide their fits of rage and the impression that red faced fury rules their actions.

Not Donald Trump.

In three-and-a-half months in office, the 45th President has shown that indignation, impulsiveness and a prickly desire to protect his own self image are at the core of his governing philosophy.

The latest example of the President's simmering fury has emerged in the aftermath of his firing of James Comey this week, apparently the culmination of long-brewing animosity towards the FBI director.

Trump gave a glimpse of his irritation and impatience with Comey during an interview with NBC News on Thursday.

""He's a showboat,"" Trump said. ""He's a grandstander.""

JUST WATCHED Trump: I planned to fire Comey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: I planned to fire Comey 02:13

Trouble

But such visceral reactions sometimes get the President into trouble. The sudden dismissal of Comey for example could do more than deal a political blow to the President. It could lead him onto perilous constitutional ground and risks embroiling him in a web of investigations that could lead off in unpredictable directions and dig up all sorts of hidden political or legal baggage.

This would not be the first time Trump has hurt himself politically with his temper.

He's spent weeks, for example, waging feuds sparked by his own anger -- opening his presidency with a showdown over the size of his inauguration crowd, then claiming, apparently furious at the never ending Russia election meddling story, that he was wire-tapped by President Barack Obama.

His daily torrent on Twitter, and at less frequent news conferences and campaign rallies, also reveal his highly emotional response to the merest political slight and thin skin for criticism.

But even though his outbursts hurt him sometimes, there's a reason he may be reluctant to cool it. Anger has been a potent political weapon to connect with the animosity toward Washington felt by his supporters. He admitted as much during an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett in January 2016.

""I am angry. I am angry, and a lot of other people are angry too about how incompetently out country is being run. I am extremely angry and upset about it and I think its ridiculous,"" Trump said.

Presidential temperament

Trump is not the first President to feel the bile boiling within. Lyndon Johnson's temper iswaslegendary. Richard Nixon's stomach-clutching fury about his foes is revealed in the White House taping system that led to his downfall. Bill Clinton's staff feared his puce-faced rages. And even Barack Obama vented in private when the cameras were off in rants mostly reserved for his staff, like on the occasion when the Healthcare.gov website crashed on its launch day.

But unlike those Presidents, Trump's emotions and anger form the dominant strain of his political persona. They seem to largely dictate how he conducts his business as president, lashing out at perceived enemies, seemingly without forethought.

The Comey drama suggests serious downsides to such an approach.

It also raises a potentially crucial question that gets to the heart of Trump's hopes for forging a successful presidency. Could his impetuous and extemporaneous use of his executive power become a fatal flaw and lead him into situations far more serious than the political spats he has battled through so far, and even into legal jeopardy?

Any president has the right to replace an FBI director. But it is the timing and the optics surrounding the Comey dismissal that are troublesome for the White House, since the FBI director was overseeing a probe into whether Trump aides cooperated with a Russian effort to meddle in the US election.

Trump was reportedly also mad that Comey refuted his wiretapping claims in a congressional hearing -- though he did some damage control on that issue in his NBC News interview.

""I was surprised he said it but I wasn't angry,"" Trump said.

Comey's departure raised suspicions that Trump's decision was motivated not just by deep personal animosity but was an attempt to derail an investigation with the potential to expose deep wrongdoing in his inner circle.

It's what's motivating Trump's anger in this case that will dictate how it turns out.

If Trump did just fire Comey in a fit of pique, he may damage himself politically and foster impressions that his administration is in disarray but he's unlikely to find himself careening down a dangerous legal slope.

But if Trump's anger is motivated by some inside knowledge of alleged links between Russia and his campaign team, or the worry that some other wrongdoing could be exposed, that would be another matter.

""If it turns out for example that the presidency had nothing to do with any of that, if it turns out that it was entirely irrelevant and he is firing Comey for political reasons it pretty much dies on the vine,"" said Andrew Hall, a lawyer who represented John Ehrlichman, assistant to the President for domestic affairs during the Nixon administration who was caught up in Watergate.

""But if it goes further than that to show that he is trying to protect either himself, or some other member of his team from the disclosure of an event that would be criminal or an huge embarrassment and he goes through illegal acts that would prevent the disclosure, then he is going to get himself into trouble,"" Hall said.

Motive unclear

So far it's been almost impossible to judge whether Trump's is simply acting rashly or with more nefarious forethought since his own administration's explanations have been laced with confusion and contradictions.

He told Comey for example in his letter or dismissal that he was accepting a recommendation he received on Tuesday from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to let him go because of his handling into the Clinton email investigation.

The next day, the White House said that Trump had actually been thinking of canning Comey ever since he was elected in November.

CNN's Jeff Zeleny and John King reported that the President was ""white hot"" over Comey , and complained about the FBI chief's comment that he felt ""mildly nauseous"" that his comments about Clinton may have swayed the election.

Trump also thought that the FBI boss did not take leak investigations seriously enough and thought he was his ""own man"" who could spell trouble being so close to the presidency, CNN reported.

Then on Thursday, Trump came up with his own motive for canning Comey complaining about his ""showboat"" persona.

The various accounts certainly fog the issue politically and make it difficult to understand exactly what the President's intentions were.

But they may also inadvertently be providing Trump with a legal shield.

""The more plausible, benign reasons and motivations you may have to do a firing of an otherwise at-will employee actually can undermine a prosecutor's case in a criminal obstruction charge,"" CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said on ""Newsroom"" Thursday.

""If there were these non partisan, nonpolitical reasons and motivations, even if they are contradictory, and even if they cannot toe the line of a consistent story, they undermine it criminally,"" Coates said.

Still, Trump may also want to consider that even if his motives are not sinister, the White House's behavior in the Comey affair invites suspicion and investigation.

That's where administrations can get drawn into tampering or thwarting inquiries and trying to prevent truths coming out and eventually get stuck in the legal mud. After all it was not the burglary at the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate that caused Nixon's downfall, but the efforts he and his team took to cover it up.

In that sense, there may be a smart political case for Trump to keep his anger in check and to lay low for a while -- even though such a move would contradict almost every one of his personal and political reflexes.

""A sophisticated political player would know that the smartest thing to do when the storm is brewing is batten down the hatches so to speak ... let the storm pass under its own terms and you don't basically expose yourself in the storm to what ever uncertainties there are,"" said Hall, of Lamb, Hall & Leto.

""There is a whole lot of downside risk. That's the lessons of 1973 and 1974 and 1975 -- these things evolve a life of their own and your conduct really is like anger and revenge -- served hot they are very dangerous, served cold they are different,"" he said.",cnn
13,Another scorpion reported on United flight,"A United Airlines Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner takes off from Los Angeles International Airport in March 2017. (Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, special for USA TODAY)

HOUSTON — A United Airlines flight from Houston to Ecuador was delayed Thursday evening at George Bush Intercontinental Airport after a scorpion was spotted on board the plane.

It's the second time in less than a month that one of the stinging insects has been reported on a United aircraft.

According to United, a scorpion reportedly crawled out of a passenger’s clothing Thursday on Flight 1035 as the flight was preparing to take off from Bush and travel to Quito, Ecuador. Paramedics examined the passenger and determined that he had not been stung.

It is unclear whether a scorpion was ever found.

Flight 1035 eventually took off, 3½ hours late, to Ecuador.

United issued the following statement Thursday evening:

""Houston to Quito Flight 1035 returned to the gate after a scorpion reportedly emerged from a customer’s clothing. Paramedics at the gate immediately examined the customer and determined that he had not been stung.

“The customer declined further medical treatment and, as a precaution, a new aircraft was arranged. We provided all passengers with a meal voucher due to the delay and the flight, with the customer aboard, has departed for Quito.""

On April 14, another man was stung by a scorpion on a United flight from Houston to Calgary.

United has been under increased scrutiny after a passenger was dragged by aviation police off a United Express flight April 9, leaving him with a concussion and two broken teeth. The airline needed to remove four passengers after Flight 3411 from Chicago O’Hare to Louisville had loaded to make room for crew members.

Clapper, however, qualified his remarks by saying he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until Comey announced it to the public at a House hearing in March. And it's unclear how much Clapper would know about developments in the investigation after he left office earlier this year.

It's not unheard of for presidents to record conversations, using different systems to do so, with and without participants' knowledge. Six presidents secretly recorded meetings and telephone conversations between 1940 and 1973, according to historian and CNN contributor Julian Zelizer

JUST WATCHED Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey 03:23

Trump's reasoning behind firing Comey

The official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.

Sources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election. A source close to Comey told CNN's Jake Tapper Wednesday there are two specific reasons why Trump fired the FBI director:

1. Comey never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty.

2. The FBI's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia in the 2016 election was accelerating.

Trump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was ""not possible"" for his team to recount details and talking points with ""perfect accuracy.""

On Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.

Trump told NBC's Lester Holt: ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'""

Comey has not yet responded to the Senate intelligence committee's invitation to testify in closed session next week, Democratic and Republican spokespersons for the committee told CNN Friday.

Trump threatens press

Comey was not Trump's only target of an apparent threat Friday -- he also suggested the possibility of ending White House press briefings

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

6,Trump just threw his entire WH staff under the bus,"In an interview with NBC's Lester Holt Thursday night , the President directly contradicted the reasoning his staff -- as well as Vice President Mike Pence -- had laid out for his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.

""I was going to fire Comey -- my decision,"" Trump told Holt. ""There is no good time to do it, by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

That assertion came fewer than 18 hours after Pence was on Capitol Hill telling a totally different story. ""The President took strong and decisive leadership here to put the safety and the security of the American people first by accepting the recommendation of the deputy attorney general to remove Director Comey as the head of the FBI,"" Pence said Wednesday.

And he was far from the only one singing from that songbook -- which Trump promptly ripped up in his interview with Holt.

""The President was presented with a pretty clear and direct and very strong recommendation by deputy Attorney General (Rod Rosenstein),"" said White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""The deputy made the recommendation, the president made a swift and decisive action and let Comey go.""

Then there was this from White House counselor Kellyanne Conway: ""He acted decisively today, he took the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General.... I would really ask everyone tonight to read Mr. Rosenstein's memo. This is what he presented to the Attorney General, he presented to the President and the President took decisive action.""

There is no amount of spin available in the world that would somehow make what Trump said Thursday night jibe with what his aides and his vice president said earlier in the week. It's simply not possible. C-a-t doesn't spell dog.

Trump seemed to acknowledge Friday morning the impossibility of his surrogates keeping up with him: ""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" he tweeted.

As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Why would Trump say what he said to Holt -- knowing that it would undermine the significant work his White House had done over the past 24 hours to cast the Comey firing as more than just a fit of pique by the President?

Simple. Trump imagines himself as the decider, the guy sitting in the boardroom and telling people ""you're fired!"" (Never underestimate how much of his personality as president is shaped by his time as a reality show boss on ""The Apprentice."") While the story of Rosenstein detailing the FBI's issues with Comey in a memo to Trump and then Trump thoughtfully considering it before making a decision is clearly the best face to put on the situation, it doesn't make the President central enough to the firing.

Trump wants the credit. He wants everyone to know he had already made the decision to get rid of Comey before the Rosenstein memo. Because he's the boss. He's the guy who makes the calls. He doesn't sit around and wait for memos from underlings.

Seen in this light, the Rosenstein memo was nothing more than a paper-trail creation to justify Trump's action. Trump was going to get rid of Comey because he didn't like Comey -- thought he was a showboat and insufficiently loyal. Period. Everything else, as Trump himself made clear in the interview with Holt, is just window-dressing.

Trump has always been a solo operator. He likes it that way. He wants the credit any time he feels credit is due. Being a member of his staff is accepting that reality and eating the embarrassment that comes with your boss directly and publicly contradicting you in the space of 18 hours.

6,Comey turmoil puts Trump's isolation on view,"Washington (CNN) Days after his abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump's attempts to triage the fallout only plunged the episode further into confusion.

Conflicting accounts of how and why the firing happened ricocheted across Washington Thursday, each seeming to push the decision closer to Comey's oversight of an investigation into Russian election meddling.

Trump himself linked the decision to the Russia probe in an interview. His spokeswoman suggested Comey's dismissal could hasten the inquiry.

The turmoil surrounding Comey's dismissal has frustrated the President and his senior-most aides, according to people familiar with the situation. All have expressed anger that the decision to fire Comey wasn't properly executed and created a sharp backlash. The topic has all but consumed the West Wing, where Trump remains holed up Friday, his seventh straight day without a public event.

Attempts to move on from the firing have been minimal. Trump's own official schedule remains empty, leaving some of his allies wondering whether his governing agenda has veered drastically off course. Even the normal parade of photo-ops has been scrapped; instead, Trump signed two executive orders behind closed doors Thursday, avoiding any more questions about his decision to remove Comey from his post.

It all led to the impression of a commander in chief operating in chaotic isolation while leaving even his closest allies to pick up the pieces. Trump seemed to confirm the situation himself on Twitter Friday morning.

'I was going to fire Comey'

There are few signs that the crisis is close to lifting.

On Friday morning, Trump fired off a thinly veiled threat to Comey: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.""

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

The tweet marks an extraordinary development in the ongoing feud between Trump and the agencies investigating alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.

Trump also threw two days of official White House accounts into dispute by insisting he'd long planned to fire Comey, even before his Justice Department provided him a reason, and suggesting he was thinking about the FBI's Russia investigation when he made the decision.

""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,' "" Trump told NBC News.

""Regardless of the recommendation,"" Trump told NBC, ""I was going to fire Comey.""

That flew in the face of what his top deputies -- including Vice President Mike Pence -- had said publicly about the incident in the 24 hours after the dismissal. Pence said seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday that Trump acted only after receiving the recommendation to fire Comey from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump's spokeswoman, explaining her own statements that seemed to be contradicted by the President's interview, said Trump hadn't told her that he was long planning to dismiss his FBI director.

""I hadn't had a chance to have the conversation directly,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday. ""I went off of the information I had when I answered your question. I've since had the conversation with him, right before I walked on today. And he laid it out very clearly. He had already made that decision. He had been thinking about it for months.""

Meanwhile, the FBI's acting director told a congressional panel that Comey enjoyed ""broad support"" at the FBI, further undercutting Trump's explanation that Comey had been dismissed because he'd lost the support of his staff.

Toxic atmosphere

In his interview, Trump said Comey had fostered a toxic atmosphere at the FBI, which his dismissal was meant to remedy. But on Capitol Hill, the agency's acting director denied that rank-and-file agents at the bureau were dissatisfied with their leadership. Instead, he said Comey commanded widespread respect among his employees, including himself.

""I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard,"" said the acting director, Andrew McCabe. ""I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity.""

He said Comey enjoyed ""broad support within the FBI and still does to this day"" and added ""the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey.""

People within the bureau said the firing had caused anger among agents toward Trump. A planned visit by Trump to FBI headquarters this week never materialized.

""He wouldn't have been received well,"" one official said of the President, noting the bureau remains shellshocked over Comey's firing.

At the White House, tensions were high. Many top officials placed blame on the press office for its handling of the situation, though few in the communications wing had advance warning that Trump was planning to fire Comey.

One official called the attempts to handle the aftermath an ""embarrassment. Another termed the cleanup attempts ""a disaster.""

The President himself thought it was ""handled poorly,"" according to one person familiar with Trump's thinking.

The scramble to contain the fallout of Trump's decision reflects a sudden change for a president who, less than a week ago, was celebrating a major victory: passage of a Republican health care plan in the House of Representatives. The moment has proven distracting for a President facing a series of hard decisions about US policy, as well as a grueling five-stop foreign swing that begins in just over a week.

Grudges

Trump himself signaled his continued preoccupation with the matter Thursday afternoon, sending a message on Twitter citing his longtime nemesis, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who called for Comey's dismissal in December.

""We finally agree on something Rosie,"" the President wrote. Moments later, he continued his Twitter tirade: ""Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.""

The messages reflected Trump's longstanding preoccupation with the claims his campaign coordinated with Russia during last year's election. Trump has viewed the claims -- along with the FBI investigation into them -- as a challenge to the legitimacy of his presidency, according to people who have spoken with him.

Trump has been nearly perpetually frustrated by Russia probe, which he believes has overshadowed parts of his agenda, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Trump also bore a grudge against Comey for shooting down his claims during public congressional testimony that Trump's phones had been tapped by President Barack Obama's administration, according to sources.

But firing Comey did not end the conversation about the FBI's look into Russian meddling; if anything, the story has emerged with renewed force.

""You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,"" McCabe said.

Meanwhile, at the White House, Trump's spokeswoman suggested that Comey's firing could hasten the FBI's work.

""We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,"" Sanders said, referring to the FBI's probe into Moscow's interference in last year's election. ""And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.""",cnn

6,AG Sessions paves way for stricter sentencing in criminal cases,"(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a new directive for federal prosecutors across the country: charge suspects with the most serious offense you can prove.

Friday's announcement follows a line of several other significant departures from Obama-era domestic policies at the Justice Department, but this decision crystalized Sessions' position in the criminal justice realm.

In a brief one-and-a-half-page memo , Sessions outlined his new instructions for charging decisions in federal cases, saying that his new first principle is ""that prosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense.""

""The most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial guidelines sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences,"" Sessions later adds.

While the federal sentencing guidelines are advisory -- and take into account everything from a defendant's criminal history to cooperation with authorities -- some judges have felt handcuffed by mandatory minimums, which provide a statutory sentencing minimum of months below which the judge cannot depart.

The move was harshly criticized by the New York University School of Law Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute focused on democracy and justice.

""The Trump administration is returning to archaic and deeply-flawed policies,"" Inimai Chettiar, the center's justice program director, said Friday. ""Sessions is leaving little to no room for prosecutors to use their judgment and determine what criminal charges best fit the crime.""

""That approach is what led to this mess of mass incarceration,"" she added. ""It exploded the prison population, didn't help public safety, and cost taxpayers billions in enforcement and incarceration costs.""

The American Civil Liberties Union said Sessions' move would return the government to failed policies and could prompt long mandatory minimum sentences.

""Jeff Sessions is pushing federal prosecutors to reverse progress and repeat a failed experiment -- the War on Drugs -- that has devastated the lives and rights of millions of Americans, ripping apart families and communities and setting millions, particularly black people and other people of color, on a vicious cycle of incarceration,"" said Udi Ofer, director of the ACLU's Campaign for Smart Justice.

Sessions also formally withdrew a signature part of Attorney General Eric Holder's ""Smart on Crime"" initiative, which sought to target the most serious crimes and reduce the number of defendants charged with non-violent drug offenses that would otherwise trigger mandatory minimum sentences.

""We must ensure that our most severe mandatory minimum penalties are reserved for serious, high-level, or violent drug traffickers,"" Holder wrote in a 2013 memo. ""In some cases, mandatory minimum and recidivist enhancements statutes have resulted in unduly harsh sentences and perceived or actual disparities that do not reflect our Principles of Federal Prosecution.""

As a result, during the Obama era, federal prosecutors were instructed not to charge someone for a drug crime that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence if certain specific factors were met: (a) the relevant conduct didn't involve death, violence, a threat of violence or possession of a weapon; (b) the defendant wasn't an organizer, leader or manager of others within a criminal organization; (c) there were no ties to large-scale drug trafficking operations; and (d) the defendant didn't have a ""significant"" criminal history (i.e., prior convictions).

All of those charging factors are now gone under Sessions' reign and not surprising, as he has previously telegraphed his desire to prosecute more federal cases generally.

The effects of Friday's decision are likely to be felt most immediately in the narcotics context where federal mandatory minimums established by Congress can be harsh for even first-time offenders because the sentences are dictated based on drug type and quantity.",cnn

US President Donald Trump has warned fired FBI chief James Comey against leaking material to the media.

In a tweet on Friday, he said Mr Comey had ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"".

Mr Comey, who had been leading an inquiry into possible collusion between Trump election campaign officials and Russia, was fired on Tuesday.

Mr Trump has since insisted he was told by Mr Comey that he was not under investigation.

Read more:

Twice over dinner and once over the phone Mr Comey had told him he was not a target of the inquiry, the US president said.

His comments raised accusations among opponents that he was interfering in the investigation.

Mr Trump also said this week that he alone was responsible for the decision to sack Mr Comey, calling him a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"".

But this explanation appeared to undermine earlier comments from administration officials that Mr Comey had been fired on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein.

The first line of Mr Trump's letter sacking Mr Comey refers to a memo written by Mr Rosenstein and says: ""I have accepted their recommendation"".

But he later told NBC he was ""going to fire him regardless of the recommendation"".

Apparently angered by criticism of the different accounts, Mr Trump used another of his tweets on Friday to say: ""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!""

He added: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

Mr Trump has dismissed the FBI investigation as a ""charade"" and has said Democrats are using ""fake news"" about collusion with the Russians as an excuse for losing the election.

It was unclear whether Mr Trump's reference to ""tapes"" suggested there might be secret recordings of conversations that could be used to challenge any statements by Mr Comey, or whether it was simply a way of warding him off from commenting.

But the reference has done nothing to silence the echoes of the Watergate affair that have resounded around the Russian interference inquiry.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon sacked Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor who was seeking access to tapes of presidential conversations that ultimately led to Mr Nixon's resignation.

In testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff.

""I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,"" Mr McCabe said.

Separately on Friday, Mr Trump's lawyers said a review of the past 10 years of his tax returns showed ""no income of any type from Russian sources"".

3,Mexican mum who investigated daughter's death is killed,"Image copyright EPA

A Mexican businesswoman who headed a group of 600 families searching for their disappeared relatives has been killed.

Miriam Rodríguez Martínez was shot in her home in the town of San Fernando in Tamaulipas state.

She was known for successfully investigating the kidnap and murder of her daughter by a local drug cartel, the Zetas.

The information she gave the police ensured the gang members were jailed.

But in March one of them escaped and her colleagues said she started to receive threats.

She was killed on Mexico's mother's day, 10 May.

Her colleagues said she had asked for police protection but was ignored.

State prosecutor Irving Barrios told a news conference that security needs had been met and police officers made rounds three times a day. Her family disputes this.

The Mexican human rights commission issued a statement saying it deplored her murder and called for a full investigation.

Mrs Rodríguez founded the local group for families who were victims of violence after her daughter, Karen Alejandra, was kidnapped in 2012.

She had managed to find her daughter's body in a clandestine grave and put her murderers in jail.

She also foiled an attempted kidnapping by the Zetas of her husband, when she chased the gang in her car, at the same time notifying the army who then managed to arrest them.

According to one of her fellow campaigners, Mrs Rodríguez felt she could not sit back after her daughter's killers were caught.

""She told us that she was incomplete, that although she had found her daughter, nothing would ever return to normal for her,"" Graciela Pérez told the BBC.

Ms Pérez, who also has a missing daughter, described the murdered activist as someone ""with a very strong, caring and cheerful character"".

The group she established was part of a wider trend which mushroomed after the October 2014 disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero.

Frustrated by a lack of government help, groups of families began their own searches for people who had disappeared in their areas, taking courses in forensic anthropology, archaeology, law, buying caving equipment and becoming experts in identifying graves and bones.

There are now at least 13 of these groups across the country.

6,Lib Dems to back a 'regulated cannabis market' in UK,"Image caption The party has long argued drugs laws are a ""failure"" and made fresh calls for a regulated cannabis market

The Liberal Democrats would legalise selling and growing cannabis if elected, the party has confirmed ahead of publishing its manifesto.

The party would allow licensed shops to sell the drug to over-18s, let people grow cannabis at home and introduce small ""cannabis social clubs"".

The Lib Dem spring conference in 2016 backed a regulated cannabis market.

The party's manifesto will also include a promise to extend paid parental leave for fathers from two weeks to a month.

Under UK legislation, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments - but many argue that the law is not enforced.

Supplying or producing cannabis, which is a class ""B"" drug, attracts a maximum 14-year prison sentence, unlimited fine or both, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

'Criminal gangs'

It is legal to consume small amounts of marijuana in some other countries - including Norway, the Netherlands and Portugal - while in other countries police do not arrest people for possession.

In 2001, Portugal became the first country in the world to decriminalise the use of all drugs.

Last year, the Lib Dems backed proposals for a ""regulated market"" to control the pricing, potency and packaging of sales to over-18s.

The proposals were outlined in a report, co-authored by the government's former chief drugs adviser Sir David Nutt, which argued that cannabis should be taxed - and that doing so could yield up to £1bn a year for the government.

Image caption In the Netherlands, cannabis products are sold in ""coffee shops"" and possession of small amounts for personal use is allowed

The Lib Dems' Julian Huppert confirmed the policy would appear in its upcoming manifesto to BuzzFeed, saying: ""The market is run by criminal gangs and they have no interest in public health - the system is causing huge amounts of harm.""

During the 2015 election campaign, the Lib Dems called for drug use to be treated as a health rather than a public policy issue.

Labour in its 2015 manifesto called for better drug treatment services, while the Conservatives said they would introduce random drug-testing in jails.

Speaking last year, the Lib Dems' health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said that ""the war on drugs has been a catastrophic failure"".

""We criminalise thousands of people, blighting their careers,"" he said. ""When people buy cannabis from criminals, they have no idea what they are buying.""

'Health and happiness'

The party is also promising extra paid paternity leave - which it is calling ""Daddy Month"" in a bid to encourage more sharing of parental responsibilities.

Jo Swinson, equalities minister in the coalition government when shared parental leave was introduced in 2015, said: ""More needs to be done to encourage men to take leave when they become a dad.

""Research shows that fathers being more involved in their children's lives is good for children's development and good for the health and happiness of the whole family.""

Labour has also said it supports extending paid paternity leave.",bbc-news

Reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner says she is considering entering US politics in a bid to promote transgender issues.

She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had been ""really upset"" by some of President Donald Trump's policies on the LGBT community.

The ex-Olympic athlete, who changed her name and transitioned to living as a woman aged 65, said Mr Trump was being ""influenced by people around him"".

Jenner said her life was ""much simpler"" now she was living openly as a woman.

Over the past two years, Jenner has become the most famous transgender person in the world.

'No regret'

A Republican supporter who supported Mr Trump in last year's US election, Jenner said she was disappointed the new president had overturned guidance allowing transgender students to use school toilets matching their gender identity.

""It doesn't make me regret my vote yet, but it is very disappointing and I have been very verbal about that,"" she said.

""I thought Trump would be better on these issues.""

Asked why she believed that, she said it was because she had ""talked to him"", adding: ""I will have more conversation with him about it in the future.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A former athlete, Jenner won gold at the 1976 Olympics

She told the programme she was now considering going into politics to promote LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues.

""I do a lot of political stuff, but it is mostly all behind the scenes,"" she said.

Asked if she would stand for election, she added: ""I have been asked that question quite a bit, to be honest with you - over the next year I'm looking into it.

""I want to know where can I do a better job for my community, in bringing the Republican Party around when it comes to all LGBT issues.

""Is it from the outside? Kind of working on the outside and the perimeter and working with everybody to get the Republicans to change their thinking?

""Or is it better off being on the inside and actually running for a Congress or Senate seat? Can I do more good there? And those are the things that I am evaluating.""

10,Smartphones that charge in five minutes 'could arrive next year',"Image copyright StoreDot Image caption StoreDot has produced mock-ups of a smartphone charging in a special dock

Smartphones with batteries that fully charge in five minutes could be available to consumers next year.

The technology was first shown off in 2015, when Israeli start-up StoreDot demonstrated its FlashBattery at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.

Chief executive Doron Myersdorf told the BBC it is now expected to enter production in early 2018.

However, Ben Wood, a technology analyst at CCS Insight, said he had doubts about the claims.

Mr Myersdorf said he could not reveal which manufacturers were signed up to use the technology.

In 2015, he told the BBC his firm's battery contained materials that allowed for ""non-traditional"" reactions and the unusually fast transfer of ions from an anode to a cathode - the electrical process that charges a battery.

The design involves nanomaterials, which feature extremely small structures, and - unnamed - organic compounds.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC was shown a demonstration of the fast-charging battery in 2015

Some versions of the battery were thicker than most smartphone batteries at the time, but now Mr Myersdorf has claimed it is ready for the market.

""We will charge a smartphone in five minutes,"" he said.

He added that the technology was in pilot production at two Asian battery makers and that ""mass production"" was expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018.

'Remain sceptical'

Mr Wood, while remaining unconvinced whether the rollout would happen as quickly as claimed, did admit that if the battery worked as planned, then it could be a major moment in the industry.

""Taking risks with battery technology can bite you,"" he told the BBC. ""I would say that experience has taught me to always remain sceptical. Let's see if it happens would be my view.""

He pointed out, for example, that any design that generates large amounts of heat can impact the performance of the battery.

However, he added that anyone who did manage to crack the ""battery problem"" could have a transformational effect on consumer electronics.

Other manufacturers are also working on quick-charging battery tech.

In November, Qualcomm announced its Quick Charge 4 system, for example, that offers five hours of battery life following a five-minute charge.

Image copyright StoreDot Image caption StoreDot claims it could also charge a car battery in only five minutes

StoreDot also unveiled an electric car battery that charges in five minutes at a tech show in Berlin this week.

The firm said the battery provides 300 miles of range.

A demonstration of the technology was given at the Cube Tech Fair - though the short presentation ended before the battery had finished charging.

""We don't have contracts but we are working with car companies to develop the battery - this will take another three years or so to be on the road,"" said Mr Myersdorf.

By contrast, Elon Musk's electric vehicle firm Tesla says its Supercharger technology takes 75 minutes to fully charge the battery in one of the firm's cars, such as a Model S for example.

A 30-minute charge would allow for 170 miles of range with the same system.

""Consumers want charge times similar to filling up their cars at a petrol station,"" said Joe Kempton, an analyst at Canalys.

But real applications would depend on ""whether the technology can be produced at a large enough scale"" and at the right cost, he added.",bbc-news

Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

Europe braced for the possibility of an in-cabin laptop and tablet ban on flights to the United States as officials prepared for talks Friday about expanding a March ban for airlines flying out of some Middle East and African airports that would affect millions of passengers.

Officials from France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy will take part in a conference call later Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a transport spokeswoman for the European Commission, the 28-nation political bloc's executive branch, confirmed the talks.

No decision has been made and it was not clear when one would may be handed down. Itkonen said the EU had no new information about a specific security concern that would have prompted the talks or required additional safety measures.

Any expansion of the ban that currently impacts eight countries in the Middle East and Africa could affect U.S. carriers such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. The United Kingdom has a similar ban in place for some in-bound flights, although its list of targeted countries differs from that of the United States.

The ban was introduced in March over fears that bombs or explosive materials could be concealed on small electronic devices brought onboard. The nine airlines affected are Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways. The ban does not prevent passengers from checking laptops and other electronic devices into luggage holds.

Still, the move could lead to fewer bookings and would complicate passengers' travel plans. The U.S. is a major destination for Europe-originated flights, with more than 10 million travelers flying there each year from destinations across the continent.

Cellphones would still be allowed in cabins but virtually every other electronic device would not be permitted. One issue that has become a focus for security officials is how to make sure that lithium batteries used in laptops aren't turned into bombs that can be detonated mid-air even if when stored in luggage holds.

WASHINGTON – Attorney General Jeff Sessions is directing federal prosecutors to seek ""the most serious'' criminal charges against suspects, a move that would result in severe prison sentences – and is expected to reverse recent declines in the overcrowded federal prison system.



The brief, two-page directive, issued to the 94 U.S. attorneys offices across the country late Thursday, replaces a 2013 memo put in place by then-Attorney General Eric Holder that sought to limit the use of mandatory-minimum sentencing rules that had condemned some non-violent offenders to long prison terms – that proved to be expensive for taxpayers.

Justice officials said the new policy would not target low-level drug offenders, unless they were linked to firearms, gang membership or other aggravating crimes.

""This policy affirms our responsibility to enforce the law, is moral and just, and produces consistency,'' Sessions said in the directive. ""This policy fully utilizes the tools Congress has given us. By definition, the most serious offenses are those that carry the most substantial... sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences.''

Under the plan, ten-year mandatory minimum sentences would typically be sought in cases where suspects were in possession of 1 kilogram of heroin (equal to thousands of doses); 5 kilograms of cocaine (about 11 pounds); or 1,000 kilograms of marijuana (more than 2,000 pounds).

""There will be circumstances in which good judgment would lead a prosecutor to conclude that a strict application of... the charging policy is not warranted,'' Sessions said. But such exercises of discretion, the attorney general said, would be subject to high-level approval.

Justice officials already have alerted federal prison officials that the action, in conjunction with the administration's recently announced increase in immigration prosecutions, would likely result in a larger prison population.

Last month, Sessions directed federal prosecutors to bring felony charges against immigrants suspected of making repeated illegal entries to the United States. Undocumented entry cases have been previously charged as misdemeanors.

During the Obama administration, Holder's policy had sought to reduce the size of the federal prison system that has long been a financial drag on the Justice Department, representing about 25% of its budget. That policy echoed shifts in law enforcement policy that had been sweeping the states in recent years. State officials have increasingly acknowledged that they can no longer bear the cost of warehousing offenders – many for drug crimes – who were targets of harsh punishments which began decades ago.

The number of sentenced prisoners in federal custody fell by 7,981 inmates – or 5% – between the end of 2009 and 2015, according to a January Pew Research Center analysis. Preliminary figures for 2016 show the decline continued during Obama’s last full year in office and that the overall reduction during his tenure will likely exceed 5%, the center found.

The federal prison population now stands at nearly 190,000 inmates.

WASHINGTON — In a flood of angry tweets Friday morning, President Trump threatened the press and James Comey personally as he continues to grapple with the fallout from his abrupt firing of his FBI director and the conflicting stories he and his aides have told about it.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump said in a tweet that he followed up in a second missive: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

...Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy??? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

As for the former FBI director, Trump tweeted: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

It is not known whether Trump tapes his conversations.

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance.

""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Trump's statements raised even more questions about his decision to fire the FBI director who was running an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 presidential election.

That coverage of the Comey story prompted the Friday tweetstorm from the president, who also continued to loudly deny that he or his team had anything to do with Russia's hacking Democrats during the 2016 election.

While Democrats continue to decry the timing of Comey's firing was a way to short-circuit the ongoing counterintelligence probe, Trump tweeted that is is all politics: ""Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.""

Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

In yet another tweet, Trump called the investigation into his campaign associates’ ties to Russia a “witch hunt,” insisting that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there was no collusion.

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Clapper has said the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any any evidence of collusion. Clapper also said he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation itself until Comey disclosed it publicly in March. But that's not the same thing as saying, definitively, that no collusion took place.

In his short termination letter to Comey, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation over Russia. He later elaborated those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency' acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

In an earlier tweet, the president returned to one of his favorite subjects – the media: ""The Fake Media is working overtime today!""

The Fake Media is working overtime today! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Trump has frequently attacked the press during his four months in office. He's made cracks about ""fake media"" and threatened to change libel laws. But this appears to be the first time he has gone so far as to threaten to do away with briefings altogether, though briefly during the presidential transition, Trump aides had discussed moving press out of the briefing room.

News of firing took many White House officials by surprise, forcing them to scramble to provide explanations that proceeded to change in the hours and days after the news broke.

Typically, when presidents make decisions of this magnitude, there's a clear plan in place to communicate that decision to the press — and the American public. Comey is only the second director to be fired in the 82-year history of the FBI, and some journalists found it remarkable that there seemed to be such confusion at the White House among key aides.

The White House fired Comey with no replacement set, with no clear messaging and no legal experts or surrogates lined up. — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) May 10, 2017

A North Korean parliamentary committee made a rare move Friday, sending a letter of protest to the U.S. House of Representatives over its new package of sanctions.

The missive comes as Pyongyang has been in high-outrage mode for weeks after President Trump threatened the reclusive nation with military action over its ballistic and nuclear weapons tests, and over North Korea's claims it thwarted a CIA plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un with a bomb laced with chemical weapons.

The committee denounced the sanctions as ""the most heinous act against humanity that not only infringes upon the sacred sovereignty of (North Korea) but also arbitrarily violates universal principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries which run through the United Nations Charter."" North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency published the letter.

Since North Korea and the United States have no formal diplomatic relations and virtually no official channels of communication, it was not immediately clear how the letter was dispatched — if it was sent by mail, email — or even how it was addressed. The was also no immediate word on whether it had been received.

Pyongyang regularly uses pugnacious rhetoric to condemn moves by Washington to censure its activities. A direct complaint to Congress is uncommon.

The parliamentary foreign affairs committee responsible for the letter had been mothballed for almost two decades. Kim recently revived it, a move that could be interpreted as an attempt by Pyongyang to create a “window” for contacts with the outside world, especially with Seoul and Washington, Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Dongguk University, told the Associated Press.

The House on May 4 voted overwhelmingly in favor of the sanctions that target North Korea's shipping industry and its use of ""slave labor"" — goods produced by forced labor. Before the sanctions can be implemented, the U.S. Senate will need to approve them, a procedural point apparently lost on North Korea's leadership.

""The U.S. House of Representatives should think twice,"" the foreign affairs committee of the North’s Supreme People’s Assembly said in its letter. ""As (the House) enacts more and more of these reckless hostile laws, the DPRK's efforts to strengthen nuclear deterrents will gather greater pace, beyond anyone's imagination,"" it added, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's formal name.

North Korea's Central Public Prosecutors Office released a separate statement Friday via state-run media calling for ""relevant authorities to immediately detect and arrest and hand over to the DPRK the masterminds of the hideous state-sponsored crime, accomplices and their followers.""

The statement appeared to suggest that North Korea believes South Korea and the U.S. are harboring suspects related to the alleged assassination plot.

You probably remember that problem from high school math class: If you saved $5 a day and invested it at a nominal interest rate, you’d make $147,000 after 35 years. The point your math teacher was trying to make was that little amounts add up.

But you don’t have to stick a $5 bill in a jar. The virtual universe is full of deals, and shrewd Internet habits could lead to big savings over time. You don’t even have to sacrifice simple pleasures like music and video games; you can just obtain them in a smarter and more economical way.

By the way, if you’ve avoided budgeting and managing your money because it’s too cumbersome, depressing or difficult, new apps and programs make it manageable and maybe even, dare I say, fun. More on the best budgeting and finance software.

So how do you cut corners? Here are seven simple ways to save money on the internet.

1. Use online coupons

Most people hear the word “coupon” and roll their eyes. It’s tedious, snipping out little squares from the Sunday newspaper and then handing them over to a cashier. But online, this process is much easier. Visit sites like RetailMeNot or CouponCodes, and you’ll have access to discounts on everyday products. Codes work for a diverse selection of retailers, including Walmart, Target, Sears, and Macy’s. When you check out, you’ll see the words “promo code.” Just copy and paste your code into the field, and that’s it. You’ll be astounded by the rewards you can reap.

Meanwhile, Amazon has an entire section of its website dedicated to coupons. Here, you can find discounts in specific categories, such as groceries, electronics, and office supplies. The coupons get even more enticing for Prime Members. Get coupons on Amazon while you shop.

2. Get free music (or even rent it)

Twenty years ago, it was hard to imagine CDs vanishing from shelves, but today it’s hard to even find a physical music store. Now, we may be entering a new phase. Music fans may not have to buy music at all.

Music subscription services like Spotify and Pandora have huge libraries containing millions and millions of songs. They’re basically an all-you-can-eat buffet of artists and albums. For a limited selection and quality, you can sign up for free, and many listeners will be satisfied this robust offering. But for the full experience, a subscription to either service will give you access to all the latest hits.

It gets better if you’re already an Amazon Prime member. Many people enjoy their first year of Prime without ever knowing they can download music for free. Yes, you can stream songs, but you can also choose from more than a million MP3s to keep on your phone or computer.

3. Avoid in-game purchases

For years, the routine was the same: Gamers went to a store, bought a game, and took it home. When new consoles came out, gamers upgraded. Some rented games from the video store (remember those?) but the console game prices were pretty consistent.

That’s why the “in-game purchase” is such an alarming trend. You can play to a certain point, and then you have to wait or pay to proceed. It’s a splash of the cold water in an otherwise exciting experience. Apps are notorious for this practice.

Instead of paying to skip a level, get more points, or gain additional lives in a game, Google search the game’s title and the level you are attempting to master. There are sites that list exactly what you need to do to avoid paying the game developer. Best of all, the steps are free.

4. Skip the crazy gadgets

Some of these gadgets can be fun, especially if you give them as tongue-in-cheek gifts, but who actually needs a “smart” Panini maker? Is your roommate really such a jerk that you need an “ice cream lock”? And although it may be colorful, who could sleep with a “light-up pillow”?

Worse are the “proof-of-concept” projects that start their lives on crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter. Many never see the light of day, and you may lose your pledge money without ever seeing a finished product.

5. Redeem those rebates

Yes, rebates used to be a pain. Why would you mail a form in, when you don’t remember the last time you licked a stamp? Some shoppers are young enough not to know the difference between a coupon and a rebate. To refresh: Coupons are used at the time of purchase and are instantaneous. Rebates can only be redeemed after the purchase of an item, usually at full price.

But now rebates can be easy. Amazon has a special section for checking if an item you have purchased qualifies for a rebate. Manufacturers, wireless service providers, merchants, and other companies on Amazon.com use mail-in rebates to offer the best possible price on new items.

You’ll need your order number and email address handy, and make sure to keep the packing slip when your order is delivered. You’ll use these documents to complete the online rebate form. Rebates may take 12 to 15 weeks to process, but they’re another way to get cash back. Read more information about Amazon rebates.

6. Watch your smart phone’s data

Smartphones are more powerful than ever, enabling you to use GPS, Skype friends in Japan, and stream videos while sitting on a boat in the middle of a bay. These are amazing features, of course, but they also devour your data.

If you don’t have an unlimited data plan, you may run out of juice before your next billing cycle. This is the kiss of death for smartphone users. Buying more data is generally expensive, and you’re forced to add a gig or two because your phone is useless otherwise.

My suggestion is to either secure an unlimited data plan, especially if you use heavyweight apps on the go, or just carefully watch your data. You can always track how much data you have left, either through your phone’s settings or by downloading your provider’s app. 5 ways to drastically reduce your smartphone’s data usage.

7. Wait to upgrade your phone

Waiting to upgrade your phone can yield big cost savings. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)

You don’t have to tell me: Phones get better every year. Every incarnation comes with its exciting new features, like improved battery life and camera resolution. So once the next iPhone or Galaxy becomes available, why should you wait to snatch it from the display case?

For one, it’s expensive. The people who camp overnight in front of the Apple store don’t mind spending up to $1,000 on the latest model, but most of us don’t have the spare capital. If your phone is working nicely and it’s still in good physical condition, there’s no particular reason to upgrade.

Bonus: Buy your modem or router

Buying a router or modem, rather than renting one from your service provider, can save you money. (Photo: Linksys)

Too many people make the mistake of renting a modem and router from their service provider. Sure, the rental fee for modems and routers is usually nominal, about $6 per month, but after four years of service, that adds up to $288.

You can find a very decent router through Best Buy or Amazon for under $100. Better yet, buy your router based on the features you want. Not all routers are created equal. Some are faster; others are better known for security.

There are a few considerations, though: First, your internet service provider may not let you use a store-bought router or modem. Second, you may have to figure out how to install the devices yourself, and not everybody wants to deal with that. Finally, do you expect to use the same service provider for more than a year?

The same advice applies to your modem. You’re better off buying that too. How to buy the best modem.

Harry Styles performs on NBC's ""Today"" show at Rockefeller Plaza on Tuesday, May 9, 2017, in New York. (Photo: Charles Sykes, Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)

Promoting a new album is hard work, and for Harry Styles, that work involves gamely commenting on One Direction fan-fiction theories.

""Oh, is that a thing?"" he said, amused by the supposed link between his new song Sweet Creature and his 1D bandmate Louis Tomlinson. ""Well, whatever it is that it makes one feel. But I think if you listen to the lyrics, you can work out what it’s about.""

Styles' charming, British-accented modesty aside, the 23-year-old One Direction singer is poised to become one of the world's biggest pop stars with the release of his self-titled debut album (out Friday), a collection of music that Styles describes as “songs about stories, and another group of songs delving into, ‘Why did I feel like that.’”

His first single Sign of the Times was a Biblically-epic debut, drawing comparisons to David Bowie and Elton John, a logical progression from the classic-rock nostalgia heard on One Direction's final two albums. But Styles, and his similarly-aged fans, grew up in an era of music where genre distinctions have melted together, and his album spends just as much time dabbling in twangy folk and modern alt-pop than the stadium-rock of his former band.

“I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things,” he said.

And when he does name-drop a classic rock icon, he opts for a figure known more for classic songwriting than sheer starpower. “I listened to a lot of Harry Nilsson while making the album,” he said. “His lyrics are honest, and so good, and I think it’s because he’s never trying to sound clever.”

Making the album was ""like therapy"" for Styles, who explained, ""It’s so much easier saying something to an instrument than it is to a person."" And time and again when talking about his music, Styles returns to this Nilsson-esque theme of honesty, which he saw as less a goal on his album and more a responsibility. “I really didn’t want to be editing lyrics and pulling stuff out,” he said. “I kind of decided early on, that every time I said to myself, ‘Can I say this?’ I wanted to say yes.’”

As a result, Harry Styles is packed with flashbacks and allusions, with references to wild nights and inside jokes that seem coded for the people who inspired the tracks to hear. Styles himself has been the subject of these kinds of songs, his fans sleuthing out clues in lyrics from his former fling Taylor Swift. However, unlike Swift’s coy admissions to the press about her inspirations, Styles declines to drop any hints.

“I’ve never really felt like I’ve had to explain my personal life,” he said. “ And I love that with writing, you get to wrap it up with a song. I understand that people will dissect stuff like that, which is amazing, that people care enough about you to try and figure out what it means.”

That includes Sweet Creature, a sweetly-strummed ode to a person that Styles won't disclose. . “The fun thing is, you can write a love song that’s not always in the traditional sense — it doesn’t always have to be romantic or even about a person at all, if you don’t want,” he said.

And Harry Styles’ most nontraditional love story happens to be its best. Among the many other young songwriters to claim Harry Nilsson as an influence was Elliott Smith, whose achingly-intimate acoustic melodies are an unmistakable influence on Harry Styles’ final song From the Dining Table, which opens with this line, “Woke up alone in this hotel room, played with myself where were you / Fell back asleep, got drunk by noon, I've never felt less cool.”

""I’d say it’s the most honest I’ve been, I’ve never written and recorded a song like that,” Styles said about the track, which “came at a time when any barrier of editing myself had been stripped away. I never do anything while listening to it, it’s a song that makes me stop and listen rather than doing something and having it on in the background.”

Yet, Styles chooses his words carefully when asked whether the song, a lonely snapshot of a drunk kid in a hotel room, is a comment on fame, saying he has “no complaints” about his life. As always, he knows the rest of the world is listening.

“I feel very lucky to be able to travel and play music and work in music,” he said. “But for me, my favorite artists’ songs aren’t the ones where they’re talking about how great their life is, they're not the stories you want to hear. You want to know why they chose to be alone somewhere, I think that’s the stuff that makes you feel something. (That’s) way more interesting than them telling me they had champagne for dinner.""

9,The Spurs' Game 6 win was the ultimate proof Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate | FOX Sports,"In case that were still up for debate (you know, since the polling closed a month ago), San Antonio's Game 6 blowout of the Houston Rockets with Leonard on the bench served as all the evidence you need.

With Leonard on the sideline, the Spurs played a classic, Spurs-ian game. They moved the ball on offense, finding the open man and punishing the smaller Rockets on the interior. At one point, Houston had 64 total points, while San Antonio had 54 points in the paint alone.

This is no indictment of Leonard, no matter what some might tell you. (If anything, the result showed how valuable James Harden is to the Rockets. When he vanishes while somehow leaving his corporeal form behind, Houston is doomed.) In fact, credit LaMarcus Aldridge for playing within himself and the Spurs' natural offensive flow. He would have looked right at home on the championship-winning teams that beat LeBron James' Miami Heat.

Yet that's the point. The Spurs haven't had that same freedom of movement with Leonard running the offense this season, because he's learning on the job. He's learning quickly, sure, but he's not quite at the elite level as a primary offensive option that so many people think he is.

He's still adding pieces to his game — exploring what it means to be the creator on offense and the destroyer on defense, while trying to strike the balance between the two — and managing to play like one of the NBA's very best players along the way.

You can be incredibly valuable, getting better, and not be the MVP. There's some grey area left in this world, right?",fox-sports

It wasn’t all rookies at the event, as the team asked 10-time Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas – the longest-tenured Brown – to attend.

Tight end David Njoku, one of Cleveland’s three first-round picks, probably wishes his first meeting with Thomas went a little bit differently because it was definitely awkward. He thought Thomas was a coach, which I guess is an honest mistake.

9,"David Ortiz rips 'arrogant' Bobby Valentine, calls 2012 'worst season of my career' | FOX Sports","Five years later, the Bobby Valentine era in Boston – which lasted only one season – still is a sore spot for everyone from Red Sox fans to David Ortiz. In his upcoming book, Big Papi chronicles that disappointing 2012 season and throws some serious shade at his former manager.

Valentine was fired following that 69-93 campaign, as the team posted its highest loss total since 1965 – before winning the World Series in 2013 under new manager John Farrell. But it’s that 2012 season that still irks Ortiz, who chronicled his failed relationship with Bobby V in “Papi: My Story,” an excerpt of which can be found at SI.com.

Ortiz admittedly didn’t know Valentine before that season but decided to keep an open mind, despite plenty of warnings from those within the sport. But it didn’t take long for Big Papi to form his own opinions, and they weren’t positive (see: “aggravating as hell, arrogant and disrespectful”). Among the highlights:

* “It was all about [Valentine] in the spring. It was as if he wanted to prove how smart he was by running us through all these drills he’d used while managing in Japan, drills we had never done before. Bobby was in his own bubble, and I just wanted to get him out of it and tell him, “[Expletive] you.”

* [Dustin Pedroia, Adrián González and I] decided to meet with Bobby in his office and attempt to tell him how he was being perceived. It was a waste of time. We tried reasoning with him, and it was like communicating with a wall. All he did was roll his eyes and look everywhere but at us. It could not have been more obvious that he didn’t care what we had to say. We left his office shaking our heads.”

* “I thought that I would never have to hear from Bobby Valentine again after ownership fired him one day after the season ended. Of course, Bobby didn’t know how to leave town quietly.

“I’d heard that he was going to be on TV with Bob Costas, talking about his time in Boston and other things. I watched the whole thing and was shocked when I saw him tell Costas that I had quit on him and the Red Sox. All season long I was the one who had defended him, who had tried to have his back, even when it was an unpopular stance to take as far as my teammates were concerned. But it was the right thing to do, and now he had the balls to go on national TV and suggest that I quit?

“Days later, he tried to call me and apologize. I didn’t want to hear it. We had already made a trade with Toronto to bring back John Farrell to be our new manager. I knew him, kind of. Farrell had been our pitching coach when we won the World Series in 2007. When we traded for him, no one called or texted to say “good luck.” I figured we were in good hands.”

6,Comey was taken aback by Trump request for loyalty pledge,"Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey was ""taken aback"" by President Donald Trump's request for a personal assurance or pledge of loyalty at a dinner shortly after he took office, a source close to Comey told CNN Friday.

Comey refused to do so, saying he could not provide such a pledge -- those who work at the FBI pledge their loyalty to the US Constitution, not to any individual person -- but he promised to always be honest with the President.

Trump then asked if Comey would pledge ""honest loyalty,"" to which the FBI director agreed. The source said the term ""honest loyalty"" doesn't necessarily mean anything.

The late January dinner was arranged at Trump's request, the source added.

A description of the dinner and conversation was first reported Thursday night by The New York Times, although CNN had previously reported Comey's refusal to give Trump any assurance of personal loyalty.

6,Donald Trump threatened James Comey via Twitter. This is not a test.,"Washington (CNN) Just 72 hours after his shocking decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to warn Comey not to share the contents of their private conversations .

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!

Where to begin.

First, the facts. What we have here is the President of the United States openly threatening the recently-deposed FBI director to stay silent. At issue, primarily, is the claim made by Trump that Comey told him, on three separate occasions, that he was not under investigation. That would represent a major breach of protocol on Comey's part and would raise serious questions about conflicts of interest -- the same sort of questions that led then Attorney General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself from the Clinton email investigation after former President Bill Clinton boarded a plane to talk to her

Comey has yet to speak publicly about Trump's claims but his allies, without their names attached, have described the idea that he would have told the President that he wasn't under investigation as ""literally farcical,"" according to a report in the Wall Street Journal

Trump seems very interested in keeping Comey silent. Which raises all sorts of questions. Does Trump know Comey knows things that would undercut his assertions about either their conversations, the ongoing Russia investigation or something else? Does Trump really believe the best way to keep Comey quiet is to publicly threaten him? If so, why?

Then there is the fact that Trump insinuates that he did -- or could -- tape conversations with Comey, giving him a way to prove, theoretically, that he is telling the truth (and Comey isn't) about their conversations.

The last president who taped his conversations was a guy named Richard Milhous Nixon. (Regular taping of phone calls made by the president has been largely verboten since then; read this amazing piece by Yahoo's Olivier Knox on that .) It didn't end all that well for Nixon if you remember.

That Trump would invoke the specter of Nixon at the end of this week is truly startling. His dismissal of Comey led to a slew of comparisons to Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been appointed by Congress to look into the Watergate break-in. Less than 24 hours later, Trump did a surprise photo-op with Henry Kissinger, who served as Nixon's Secretary of State.

I mean, you can't make this stuff up. Truly.

It's not clear from the wording of Trump's tweet whether he actually was taping conversations with Comey or simply using the idea of doing so as a sort of Sword of Damocles to hang over the head of the former FBI director. Either way, it's very strange, to say the least.

It's difficult to see a strategy in all of this. Trump spent Thursday directly contradicting the story his staff had constructed about why Comey was fired . He spent Friday morning insisting that he is so active that his staff can't be expected to know or tell the whole truth in the daily press briefing and threatening the former FBI director into silence.

While all of Trump's presidency -- the entire 112 days of it -- has had a lurching, zig-zag feel to it, the last 72 hours -- and, especially, the last 24 -- feel even more erratic and unpredictable. Where can Trump possibly go from here?",cnn
6,Fact check: Why did President Trump fire FBI Director James Comey?,"In this Jan. 22, 2017, file photo, President Trump shakes hands with James Comey during an Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House. (Photo: Andrew Harrer, Pool/Getty Images)

Why did President Trump fire FBI Director James Comey? The president and top administration officials have offered contradictory accounts in recent days:

The official White House statement on May 9 said Trump “acted based on the clear recommendations” of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. But Trump, in an interview two days later, said he was going to fire Comey “regardless of recommendation.”

Trump said the “FBI has been in turmoil,” and a White House spokeswoman said “the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence” in Comey. “That is not accurate,” according to Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who said Comey “enjoyed broad support within the FBI, and still does to this day.”

The Rosenstein Memo

Trump fired Comey on May 9. The White House issued a statement saying, “President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.”

Rosenstein wrote a two-and-a-half page memo with the subject line “Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI” that stated the reasons why Comey should be removed. The memo cited Comey’s “handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [Hillary] Clinton’s emails.” Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a press conference on July 5, 2016, to publicly announce his recommendation not to charge Clinton, and for announcing on Oct. 28, 2016, that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Clinton.

Comey’s firing came less than two months after the director confirmed at a congressional hearing on March 20 that the bureau is investigating “whether there was any coordination between the [Trump] campaign and Russia’s efforts” to influence the 2016 presidential election.

In January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified intelligence report that found “Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election” with the goal of hurting Clinton and helping to elect Trump.

Democrats have criticized the timing of Comey’s firing, because of the ongoing investigation. But Trump administration officials said the decision had nothing to do with Russia.

On the night of Comey’s firing, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, “Why fire James Comey now?” She cited Rosenstein’s letter and his bipartisan credentials, noting that he was overwhelmingly confirmed as deputy attorney general.

Conway, May 9: ""Well, I would point them to the three letters that were received today, Anderson, the letter by President Donald Trump and letter by Attorney General Sessions and really the underlying report by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who the FBI director reports to, the FBI director traditionally reports to the deputy attorney general. Rod Rosenstein was confirmed just 14 days ago by a vote of 94 to 6 by United States senators. He’s well-respected across both sides of the aisle. He served as U.S. attorney in Maryland under President Obama. And he sent out a memo today to the attorney general and the re line, Anderson, says 'restoring public confidence in the FBI.' ""

Conway said Trump “took the recommendation of his deputy attorney general, who oversees the FBI director.”

Later in the interview, Cooper said that “a lot of people are … saying it destroys people’s confidence in the FBI” and its ability to investigate whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to interfere in last year’s election. Conway said the firing “had zero to do” with Russia and “everything to do with … Mr. Rosenstein.”

The next morning, on CNN’s New Day, Conway repeated the claim: “The president took the advice of the deputy attorney general who oversees the director of the FBI, brought those concerns to the attorney general who brought them to the president. And they made a decision to remove him.”

On MSNBC’s Morning Joe that same morning, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoed the official White House statement and Conway’s remarks when she was asked why Comey was fired.

Sanders, May 10: ""I think he’s heard from the rank and file of the FBI, but particularly someone who had done a thorough review and someone who has the respect and reputation that the deputy attorney general has, he took that seriously. He took the recommendation seriously. And he made a decision based on that.""

Trump, however, told NBC’s Lester Holt in a May 11 interview that he did not base his decision on Rosenstein’s recommendation.

Holt, May 11: ""Monday you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein."" Trump: ""Right."" Holt: ""Did you ask for a recommendation?"" Trump: ""What I did is, I was going to fire Comey. My decision. It was not —"" Holt: ""You had made the decision before they came in the room."" Trump: ""I was going to fire Comey. There’s no good time to do it, by the way."" Holt: ""Because in your letter you said, 'I accepted their recommendation.'"" Trump: ""Well, they also —"" Holt: ""So, you had already made the decision."" Trump: ""Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.""

The president told Holt, “The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn’t recovered from that.”

Comey’s ‘Broad Support’ Within FBI

Trump and others in the administration have repeatedly made the claim that Comey had lost the confidence and respect of the FBI’s rank and file.

In addition to Trump saying the FBI has been in “turmoil,” Conway on CNN’s New Day said that “Jim Comey had lost the confidence of people at the FBI.”

At a May 10 press briefing, Sanders said the president, members of Congress and the Department of Justice had lost confidence in Comey. “And most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director,” Sanders said.

McCabe — a 21-year FBI official who assumed the position of acting FBI director when Comey was fired — was asked about Sanders’ remark at a May 11 hearing of the Senate intelligence committee. “No, sir, that is not accurate,” he said.

McCabe called working with Comey “the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life.”

McCabe, May 11: ""I can tell you also that Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI, and still does to this day. We are a large organization. We are 36,500 people across this country, across this globe. We have a diversity of opinions about many things. But I can confidently tell you that the majority — the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.""

A day earlier, former FBI Deputy General Counsel Ernie Babcock told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Comey “created an atmosphere of integrity and transparency, and, unfortunately, being transparent is now becoming a political football and one side or the other will not be happy if you actually do your job.”

Tapper, May 10: ""How was morale at the FBI under Comey when you were there?"" Babcock: ""It was outstanding. Jim Comey is an inclusive leader. He would not make and did not make critical decisions on his own as some other leaders do. He brought the senior staff together on a regular basis and included them in making any of the difficult decisions.""

This is obviously a developing story and more information likely will emerge.

But what we know right now is that the White House’s initial claim that the president acted based on Rosenstein’s recommendation has been contradicted by the president himself. And its portrayal of Comey as having lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file is at best a matter of dispute.

16,Workers to recruiters: Make me an offer,"Nearly half of all workers in leisure and hospitality, which includes restaurants, switched jobs the past year. (Photo: Josh T. Reynolds, for USA TODAY)

America’s workers are on the move.

With the low unemployment rate giving workers more leverage than they’ve had in years, a surprisingly large number are either job hopping or on the lookout for new opportunities.

About 27% of employees switched jobs in the 12 months ending in the first quarter, according to payroll processor ADP, the most since the firm began tracking the figure in 2014. Three years ago, about 23% of workers left one job for another during the prior year. ADP compiles labor market data based on the 24 million U.S. employees whose employers contract with ADP to handle their payrolls,

Some areas of the labor market are havens for job switchers. Nearly half of all leisure and hospitality workers and one-third of those in professional and business services changed jobs the past year.

Not surprisingly, job hoppers are snaring bigger pay increases than their more loyal colleagues. In the first quarter, switchers who worked full-time realized average annual earnings gains of 5.2%, compared with 4.3% for full-time job holders.

“As the labor market tightens, employees have more power,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of ADP’s research institute. The 4.4% unemployment rate has resulted in a smaller pool of idle workers, forcing firms to bid up to lure employees from other companies.

One reason businesses should be nervous: 63% of workers are open to making a switch, according to a separate national survey of 2,156 employees that ADP conducted. Seventeen percent are actively looking while 46% are receptive to an overture from a recruiter.

Related:

Yet employers are a bit too complacent. Those surveyed believe only 49% of their employees are in the market, according to their average estimate. “There’s a disconnect,” Ahu said. “Employers really have to think about how to attract, how to engage, and how to retain employees.”

Alfredo Rodriguez, 29, of Denver, took an entry-level marketing job with a local mortgage company in September 2015. Within a year he landed interviews for two higher-level positions and received offers for both. He accepted a position as marketing coordinator for a national mortgage firm, snagging about a 20% raise. He said he decided to start job-hunting after hearing from friends and college classmates about an abundance of openings.

“I got a little bit of a sense there were more jobs out there,” he said.

ADP’s survey found that, all else equal, a 13% bump in pay would be enough to coax an employee to switch jobs, based on respondents’ average estimate.

Yet money isn’t necessarily the chief reason employees bolt.

Work Institute, a research firm, found that 22% of employees left their jobs last year for career development, followed by work life balance (12%), management behavior (11%), compensation and benefits (9%), and well-being (9%). Its findings were based on analysis of more than 34,000 exit interviews.

Millennials are especially antsy, with an average job tenure of less than three years, according to Tony Lee, who manages talent acquisition issues for the Society for Human Resource Management.

Since many firms have limited ability to increase pay, they should find other ways to reward workers in today’s hyper-competitive market, Lee said. Those include flexible hours, the option to work at home and even awards that shouldn’t wait until employees reach their fifth or 10th or 25th anniversaries. Lee says.

“If people feel they're being recognized, they're less likely to go somewhere else to look for” that acknowledgment, he says.

9,Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe react to James Harden’s Game 6 meltdown | FOX Sports,"Harden had the biggest meltdown since LeBron in 2011

“This was the biggest superstar meltdown we have witnessed since LeBron James in the 2011 NBA finals. No Kawhi Leonard. No Tony Parker – both of whom were NBA Finals MVPs. All the pressure was on the home team to hold serve with no Kawhi and get it back to san Antonio for Game 7. And right on cue, James Harden unraveled under that pressure. Couldn’t even take a shot for the first quarter and a half. And the truth is, it was pretty predictable. James harden has always had some LeBron in him. When the lights are brightest and the stakes are highest, he tends to shrink or melt under that pressure. I don’t even call it choking in Harden’s case because choking is what happens when you miss a last-second shot. This is big picture. This is disappearing, shrinking melting. Getting smaller and smaller.

It was a continuation of Game 5 when down the stretch, fourth quarter, no Kawhi Leonard, what happened? James Harden disappeared. … In overtime he got blanked, missed all three of his 3’s and had three game-turning turnovers. This has been the history of James Harden and people can’t see the history because they get blinded by the beard. The beard will shrink when the stakes are highest.""",fox-sports

16,Harry Styles interview: Writing his new album was 'like therapy',"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Harry Styles opens up in an interview about his new solo album. USA TODAY

Promoting a new album is hard work, and for Harry Styles, that work involves gamely commenting on One Direction fan-fiction theories.

""Oh, is that a thing?"" he said, amused by the supposed link between his new song Sweet Creature and his 1D bandmate Louis Tomlinson. ""Well, whatever it is that it makes one feel. But I think if you listen to the lyrics, you can work out what it’s about.""

Styles' charming, British-accented modesty aside, the 23-year-old One Direction singer is poised to become one of the world's biggest pop stars with the release of his self-titled debut album (out Friday), a collection of music that Styles describes as “songs about stories, and another group of songs delving into, ‘Why did I feel like that.’”

His first single Sign of the Times was a Biblically-epic debut, drawing comparisons to David Bowie and Elton John, a logical progression from the classic-rock nostalgia heard on One Direction's final two albums. But Styles, and his similarly-aged fans, grew up in an era of music where genre distinctions have melted together, and his album spends just as much time dabbling in twangy folk and modern alt-pop than the stadium-rock of his former band.

“I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things,” he said.

And when he does name-drop a classic rock icon, he opts for a figure known more for classic songwriting than sheer starpower. “I listened to a lot of Harry Nilsson while making the album,” he said. “His lyrics are honest, and so good, and I think it’s because he’s never trying to sound clever.”

Making the album was ""like therapy"" for Styles, who explained, ""It’s so much easier saying something to an instrument than it is to a person."" And time and again when talking about his music, Styles returns to this Nilsson-esque theme of honesty, which he saw as less a goal on his album and more a responsibility. “I really didn’t want to be editing lyrics and pulling stuff out,” he said. “I kind of decided early on, that every time I said to myself, ‘Can I say this?’ I wanted to say yes.’”

As a result, Harry Styles is packed with flashbacks and allusions, with references to wild nights and inside jokes that seem coded for the people who inspired the tracks to hear. Styles himself has been the subject of these kinds of songs, his fans sleuthing out clues in lyrics from his former fling Taylor Swift. However, unlike Swift’s coy admissions to the press about her inspirations, Styles declines to drop any hints.

“I’ve never really felt like I’ve had to explain my personal life,” he said. “ And I love that with writing, you get to wrap it up with a song. I understand that people will dissect stuff like that, which is amazing, that people care enough about you to try and figure out what it means.”

That includes Sweet Creature, a sweetly-strummed ode to a person that Styles won't disclose. . “The fun thing is, you can write a love song that’s not always in the traditional sense — it doesn’t always have to be romantic or even about a person at all, if you don’t want,” he said.

And Harry Styles’ most nontraditional love story happens to be its best. Among the many other young songwriters to claim Harry Nilsson as an influence was Elliott Smith, whose achingly-intimate acoustic melodies are an unmistakable influence on Harry Styles’ final song From the Dining Table, which opens with this line, “Woke up alone in this hotel room, played with myself where were you / Fell back asleep, got drunk by noon, I've never felt less cool.”

""I’d say it’s the most honest I’ve been, I’ve never written and recorded a song like that,” Styles said about the track, which “came at a time when any barrier of editing myself had been stripped away. I never do anything while listening to it, it’s a song that makes me stop and listen rather than doing something and having it on in the background.”

Yet, Styles chooses his words carefully when asked whether the song, a lonely snapshot of a drunk kid in a hotel room, is a comment on fame, saying he has “no complaints” about his life. As always, he knows the rest of the world is listening.

“I feel very lucky to be able to travel and play music and work in music,” he said. “But for me, my favorite artists’ songs aren’t the ones where they’re talking about how great their life is, they're not the stories you want to hear. You want to know why they chose to be alone somewhere, I think that’s the stuff that makes you feel something. (That’s) way more interesting than them telling me they had champagne for dinner.""

LONDON — A number of hospitals and healthcare services across England were hit by an apparent cyberattack Friday, health care authorities said.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire — north of London — and Cumbria — in northern England — were affected, according to the BBC. The NHS said 16 of its organisations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ""ransomware"" attack were demanding $300 in the electronic currency Bitcoins to release files from encryption, the Mirror and the Telegraph reported.

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organisations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organisations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organisations to confirm this.""

It said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask victims user for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack, local media reported.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results, we are dealing with urgent problems only, our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a not-for profit campaign aimed at supporting NHS staff which is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

9,Aaron Judge's cheering section at Yankee Stadium is as remarkable he is | FOX Sports,"Aaron Judge already is a larger-than-life presence in the Yankees’ batting order in his rookie season, and now he has the fan section to prove it.

Judge, who is 6-foot-7 and 280 pounds, was greeted by a group of fans dressed as judges – complete with those creepy white wigs – during Thursday’s game against the Astros at Yankee Stadium.

According to the New York Daily News, the fans are childhood friends – one even is a Red Sox fan – who came up with the idea in a group text.

“I was watching a game and was like, ‘You know what. Aaron Judge. I don’t see any judges in the stadium. Let’s do it.’ Rally the troops, and they made it happen,” Nick Greenwood, one of Judge’s judges, told the newspaper.

Alas, Judge went 0-for-3 with a strikeout in Thursday’s 3-2 loss to the Astros, but he still leads the AL in homers (13), runs (28) and OPS (1.146).

9,Dale Earnhardt Jr. among drivers hit with penalties at Kansas | FOX Sports,"Dale Earnhardt Jr., already battling a season notable for bad luck and several resulting bad finishes, will have an added challenge this weekend at Kansas Speedway, site of Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 (FS1, 7 p.m. ET).

At Talladega Superspeedway last weekend, Earnhardt’s No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet failed pre-race inspection three times, which means he will lose 15 minutes of practice time on Friday and, more importantly, the team will lose the ability to select a pit stall.

Normally, pit stall selection is based on qualifying results, with the pole-sitting winner getting first choice.

Earnhardt comes into the Kansas race 25th in points in this, his final season before retiring.

But Earnhardt wasn’t the only driver penalized at Kansas.

Kyle Busch and Corey LaJoie were held out of the first 15 minutes of practice for penalties deferred from Talladega.

And Jamie McMurray, Kyle Larson and Chris Buescher each lost 15 minutes of practice time for pre-race inspection issues at Talladega.

Last but not least, Erik Jones lost minutes of practice for missing the rookie meeting.

There are two rounds of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series practice today at 11:30 a.m. ET and 1:30 p.m., with Cup qualifying at 6:45 p.m.

You can use nasal steroids along with an antihistamine tablet to treat nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchy/watery eyes. Unlike the tablets, these can take up to a week to be effective, so you should start taking it before your symptoms get too bad. There are few different formulations (some are more of a light mist, while others are more of a squirt of liquid), so you might need to try a few to see what works best.

BOSTON — Sian-Pierre Regis was in Paris when his mother left him a voicemail that he will never forget: “I just got fired, just want you to know that. Call me. Bye.”

His 75-year-old housekeeper mother, Rebecca Danigelis, had been working in hospitality for as long as Regis could remember.

“We were raised above a hotel,” Regis says. Danigelis raised two boys by herself in Boston, above the hotel that she worked in.

“I was always very aware of the fact that everything she made went into our mouths,” Regis remembers about he and his brother’s upbringing. She cashed out her 401k to help Regis go to college, and he went on to live his dreams, while hers were set aside.

Then she got fired.

Regis decided it was time for his mother to live her dreams. He wanted to help her live her best life, and he wanted them to do it together.

The bucket list

Danigelis had been working on a bucket list of things she’s always wanted to do. “When she got fired,” says Regis, “all these bucket list items took on so much more weight.”

She added a few more items to the list and together they set off to live her dreams.

“There is a spirt within her that I’ve never seen so bright.” Sian-Pierre Regis

Some of the things on her list were pure fun: Take a hip-hop lesson with a dancer from the award-winning Broadway musical Hamilton, join Instagram, milk a cow in Vermont, take a mystery trip.

But some of her bucket list items were deeper and more meaningful to her, like visiting the grave of her sister in England.

Danigelis missed her sister’s funeral because she was working. She couldn’t find someone to cover her shift, so she didn’t attend. Standing over her sister’s grave, she sobbed, saying, “I wish I had come sooner.”

“I could see all the memories of she and her sister flooding towards her, she just felt horrible,” Regis says.

No regrets

Regis says his mother has been reflective about missing out on so many things in her life, but she says she would never change any of it. “She had to put food on the table,” he said. And her boys always were her priority.

As mother and son toured the world, ticking off her bucket list items, the duo has shared many laughs.

“There is a spirit within her that I’ve never seen so bright, she’s 75 but I’ve never seen her younger than in these moments,” Regis says.

Next chapter

This dynamic duo isn’t done with mom’s bucket list. Danigelis has yet to skydive or walk the Boston Marathon route, something she plans on doing with both her sons. She is actively looking for a job in hospitality, but says she is having trouble finding an employer who is seeking someone her age.

Regis has filmed their adventure since the beginning, hoping to share his mother’s struggle with the world, but also give her something she can cherish forever. “She’s always wanted to write a memoir,” Regis says. “So many people in their day-to-day jobs render that dream impossible, but now through this film, she’s able to tell her story and be in control of this story.”

They will continue completing items on mom’s bucket list through the end of 2017. Regis has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for production costs for his mother's film, which they've titled Duty Free.

In the meantime, follow her adventures on Instagram and Facebook. And if you see Danigelis painting a picture of her neighborhood in Boston’s Back Bay, know that she’s fulfilling another one of her dreams.

16,Melissa McCarthy's Sean Spicer impression hits the streets of NYC,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Melissa McCarthy drives Sean Spicer's podium through New York for ""SNL"" skit. (May 12) AP

Spicey — with the help of his motorized podium — is hitting the road.

On Friday morning, some lucky New York commuters spotted Melissa McCarthy dressed as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who she frequently plays on Saturday Night Live, zooming around the city's streets on the moving podium that's made an appearance in several of her cameos.

McCarthy wasn't just taking a joyride. The actress returns to SNL this weekend as guest host, and a camera crew accompanied her NYC jaunt, seemingly filming a short for the upcoming episode.

If McCarthy and the SNL crew were trying to go incognito, they failed, choosing the street outside CNN's NYC headquarters to film the scene. Naturally, CNN employees grabbed their phones and started recording the action.

Don Lemon, who President Trump called the ""dumbest person in broadcasting"" in a TIME magazine interview this week, also got in on the fun.

After the first round of Spicey-spotting tweets went viral, users started adding their own soundtracks to the video clips.

9,UFC 211 fight scrapped after Jared Gordon ends up in the hospital ahead of weigh-ins | FOX Sports,"UFC 211 has lost yet another fight in the days leading up to the event.

Jared Gordon, who was making his promotional debut against Michel Quinones, announced on Friday morning that he was taken to the hospital after suffering through symptoms similar to food poisoning.

UFC officials confirmed that Gordon was off the card under advice from a physician and his bout with Michel Quinones has been scrapped.

According to Gordon, he was advised under the care of a doctor that he required an IV for fluids before he was ultimately pulled from the card taking place Saturday night in Dallas.

“Unfortunately I will not be fighting tomorrow,” Gordon wrote on his Facebook. “Everything was going smooth last night when I turned sick at about 8-9 pm. I was experiencing food poison symptoms. I was admitted to the hospital, along side UFC’s doctor. I was advised to use an IV, by both ER and UFC’s doctor which would make me ineligible to fight because of USADA’s rules . “I’m extremely sorry to everyone who were going to attend and or watch. Just another bump in the road.”

Gordon was just bumped up to the FX prelims for UFC 211 following an injury to Henry Cejudo earlier this week that canceled his fight with Sergio Pettis on the main card.

With Gordon vs. Quinones canceled, UFC 211 moves forward with 12 total bouts on the card.",fox-sports

“I’m going to stand by what I’ve been saying all year long on this show: I don’t trust Kevin Durant to blend into the late-game chemistry when they’re pressed late in games. So far, Portland was not able to push GS into a late-game, clutch-time situation. Obviously, Utah was not capable of pushing GS late in games. my spurs are capable of hanging in and hanging on to make four of these games close games. I won’t be surprised if Game 1 is a blowout because [the Warriors] are 10-point favorites, so maybe they’ll win by 25 and you’ll come in pumping your fists.

“I wasn’t sure how this team was going to be post-Tim Duncan. And this team grew on me all year long. I just like what it’s made of. I like the will and I like the skill. There’s some grit and guts to this team featuring Patty Mills and Manu Ginobli that I love. And I think it’s going to shine through against Golden state. So im going to say that the Spurs are going to win this in seven games because if LeBron can win a Game 7 in Oakland, I believe my Spurs can win one this year.

6,Trump threatens Comey in Twitter outburst,"Soon after tweeting the threat to Comey, Trump invoked former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who testified before the Senate earlier this week that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

""When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?"" Trump tweeted.

When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Clapper, however, qualified his remarks by saying he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until Comey announced it to the public at a House hearing in March. And it's unclear how much Clapper would know about developments in the investigation after he left office earlier this year.

Clapper said on MSNBC Friday he was not intending to convict or clear anyone of collusion during his tenure.

""It would be in everyone's best interest to get to the bottom of this. And for the country,"" Clapper said. ""Otherwise, this is going to continue to linger as a dark cloud, in my opinion, over this administration.""

It's not unheard of for presidents to record conversations, using different systems to do so, with and without participants' knowledge. Six presidents secretly recorded meetings and telephone conversations between 1940 and 1973, according to historian and CNN contributor Julian Zelizer

John Dean, a former White House counsel under Nixon who served four months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal, said it would be Trump, not Comey, with the most to lose were recordings of the two men to surface.

""Obviously, President Trump is confused. He is the one who must hope there are no tapes. Honest people don't have problems being taped,"" Dean tweeted

JUST WATCHED Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper: The real reasons Trump fired Comey 03:23

Trump's reasoning behind firing Comey

The official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.

Sources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election. A source close to Comey told CNN's Jake Tapper Wednesday there are two specific reasons why Trump fired the FBI director:

1. Comey never provided the President with any assurance of personal loyalty.

2. The FBI's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia in the 2016 election was accelerating.

Trump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was ""not possible"" for his team to recount details and talking points with ""perfect accuracy.""

On Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.

Trump told NBC's Lester Holt: ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'""

Comey has not yet responded to the Senate intelligence committee's invitation to testify in closed session next week, Democratic and Republican spokespersons for the committee told CNN Friday.

Trump threatens press

Comey was not Trump's only target of an apparent threat Friday -- he also suggested the possibility of ending White House press briefings

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

WASHINGTON – An interim FBI director could be named as soon as Friday, Justice Department officials said.

Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said that acting director Andrew McCabe, who was appointed following Tuesday's abrupt firing of Director James Comey, would remain as deputy director if he was not chosen as the new interim chief.

In addition to McCabe, Flores said that Justice officials were reviewing four candidates, including three current FBI division chiefs. They are:

Adam Lee , chief of the FBI’s Richmond, Va., office. Prior to that, Lee oversaw the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In that role, Lee led the bureau’s investigations of elected and appointed government officials and civil rights violations.

Justice officials have said that the interim appointee could also be considered as an official nominee to succeed Comey, who was dismissed just four years into his 10-year term.

Meanwhile, the White House earlier this week said Trump is considering ""several individuals"" to replace Comey.

While they wouldn't discuss potential candidates to replace James Comey permanently, attention was focused on at least seven candidates, which in addition to McCabe include: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Milwaukee County Sheriff Dave Clarke; South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy; former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly; former FBI agent and former Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers, and John Pistole, a former deputy FBI director and Transportation Security Administration director.

6,Source: Comey is 'not worried about any tapes',"(CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey is ""not worried about any tapes"" of conversations between him and President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Friday, adding that ""if there is a tape, there's nothing he is worried about"" that could be on it.

Friday morning, Trump issued a thinly veiled threat to Comey, apparently suggesting there are possibly recorded conversations between the two men that could be leaked to counter the former FBI director if necessary.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press,"" Trump tweeted.

On Friday, CNN's Jake Tapper reported that Comey was ""taken aback"" by Trump's request for a personal assurance or pledge of loyalty at a dinner shortly after he took office. Comey refused, saying he could not make such a pledge, but he promised to always be honest with the President.

The source said of the dinner between Comey and Trump on January 27 that it came at Trump's request and was one-on-one.

1,The 16 best gifts for college graduates of 2017,"The 16 best gifts for college graduates of 2017 (Photo: Reviewed.com)

— Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives.

Every May, college seniors prepare to say goodbye to school and hello to adulthood. Even if grads have something planned, their life for the first time is a blank slate. It can be exciting, sad, happy, scary, and bittersweet.

If you know someone graduating in the class of 2017, help them adjust to the real world with a gift they'll actually use. Of course, you can always give grads money, but one of these gifts would make a thoughtful addition to a check or a great replacement to a wad of cash all together. Whether you give a grad a book to help them with their finances, clothes to help them build their professional wardrobe, or a laptop to help them leave their used college devices behind, all will be appreciated.

Here are 16 gift ideas for the new college graduate in your life.

1. The Amazon Echo

(Photo: Amazon)

Recent grads are likely to become someone else’s assistant, so give them the gift of their own (digital) assistant. They can ask Alexa, the voice inside the device, anything from what the weather forecast is to how old Ariana Grande is. Bonus: it plays music when asked. But that’s not all the smart device does. Read our list of EVERYTHING that works with Echo and Alexa to see what else it’s capable of.

Buy now: Amazon Echo, $149.99 (On sale from $179.99), Amazon

2. A nice watch

(Photo: Nordstrom)

Watches for some reason symbolize adulthood. This might be because time isn’t really a thing until you graduate from college and life starts going by really quickly and you realize you need to make the most of every second. That’s why you should get your grad a watch, to remind them of this sad-but-true fact of life. Shinola watches are popular right now, but there are more affordable picks out there. For men, Nixon is a great, affordable alternative. And for women, Olivia Burton and Movado are two great options.

For men

Buy now: Shinola The Canfield Chrono Leather Strap Watch, $850, Nordstrom

For women

Buy now: Olivia Burton Midi Dial Leather Strap Watch, $110, Nordstrom

3. A new laptop

(Photo: Amazon)

After four years of school, a laptop has gone through a lot. With the amount of wear and tear put on a computer during college, it might be time for a new computer when you graduate. Help your grad out with a new laptop. This popular ASUS is half the price of a Macbook, and we recommend it.

Buy now: ASUS ZenBook 13.3-inch Ultra-Slim Laptop, $699.00 (On sale from $759.99), Amazon

4. Upgraded drinking glassware

(Photo: Nordstrom)

Once you graduate from college, you have to say goodbye to the red solo cup. Okay, I’m half kidding. I grew up with three brothers and my mom definitely bought the 250-pack of red solo cups regularly so she wouldn’t have to do dishes more often than 24-7. But when it comes to drinking alcohol in the real world, you need to class it up. The whiskey drinker would love this sophisticated, monogrammed decanter. It says ‘yes, I’m adult now, but I also still like to have fun,’ which is really just the motto for recent grads.

Buy now: Monogram Decanter from Cathy’s Concepts, $42, Nordstrom

5. Professional wardrobe

(Photo: Rent the Runway)

Depending on where you work, it’s likely you can’t wear yoga pants and sweatshirts in the office every day. Wardrobes certainly need upgrading when you go from being a college student to a working professional – and spicing up your closet can get pricey. Help your grad transition their wardrobe. You can always take them shopping or give them a gift card, but for the ladies, you could give them the gift of an unlimited designer wardrobe. Rent the Runway’s unlimited subscription lets you rent three designer pieces at a time with free shipping, dry cleaning, and insurance. You can cancel it any time. I have the subscription, and I love it.

6. Nice weekend bag

(Photo: Amazon, Nordstrom)

Whether your grad is moving back home or moving to a new place, they’re most likely going to be on-the-go. Whether it’s a weekend away to visit college friends, a work trip, or a night away from the ‘rents, an overnight bag is necessary. Of course you can splurge on fancy suitcases and leather luggage, but here are two great, affordable options for both men and women.

For women

Buy now: Sole Society’s ‘Lacie’ Faux Leather Duffel Bag, $84.95, Nordstrom

For men

Buy now: Herschel Supply Co. Novel Duffle Bag, $77.25 (on sale from $84.99), Amazon

7. Business card holder

(Photo: Amazon)

Whether you have your own business cards or you’re collecting business cards from others (or both!), you need somewhere to store them. That’s where a business card holder comes in handy. There are lots of cheap options out there, but this cute Kate Spade holder is perfect for the trendy grad ready to take on the working world.

Buy now: Kate Spade “Let’s Do Lunch” Business Card Holder, $19, Amazon

8. A coffee maker

(Photo: Amazon)

Coffee is essential to getting through the work day, but it can get pretty expensive going to Starbucks every day (believe me, you don’t want to know how much money I’ve spent at coffee shops in the last month never mind the last seven years since I graduated). If you want to get them more than just a Keurig, give your grad the gift of an espresso machine. With the Nespresso, they can pretend they’re still studying abroad while drinking the finest and strongest of coffee.

Buy now: Nespresso Inissia Espresso Maker, $81.58 (On sale from $149), Amazon

Bonus buy: Espresso pods, $37.53, Amazon

9. Camera (that’s not a smartphone)

(Photo: Amazon)

If your grad is looking for a “serious” camera to capture their new adult life, look no further than the Nikon D5500. This is the perfect gift for creative people who might feel trapped in their new cubicles. They can use the camera to upgrade their Instagram page or maybe even to start a career as a photographer. Who knows!

Buy now: Nikon D5500 with lens kit, $596.95 (On sale from $796.95), Amazon

10. A gym membership

(Photo: Getty Images/Jacob Ammentorp Lund)

Most college students can go to the gym for free. In other words, it’s included in tuition. But when you stop paying for college, there’s no longer a gym to go to or fitness classes to attend for free – and that stuff gets expensive. If you’re not sure what they want to do and where they want to do it, try getting your grad a ClassPass membership. With ClassPass, members can take up to 10 classes per month at different fitness studios in their area. Check the ClassPass website to see if it's available where your grad lives.

Buy now: ClassPass Membership, $40/month - $120/month, ClassPass

11. Nice headphones

(Photo: Amazon)

If your grad is moving to the city, give them the gift of tuning people out on the subway AKA a great pair of headphones. We love the Beats Powerbeats 3 here at Reviewed. Not only are these wireless headphones great for subway riders, they’re great for working out and listening to music at work.

Buy now: Powerbeats3 Wireless In-Ear Headphones, $149.99 ($50 off), Amazon

12. An Instant Pot

(Photo: Amazon)

Part of entering the real world is doing things on your own. One of those things: cooking meals instead of always relying on the dining hall or takeout. Instead of letting a recent grad buy a bunch of small kitchen appliances for their new home, give them a device that does it all. Meet: The Instant Pot. It’s a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, yogurt maker, and more. It honestly does everything. If there’s only room for one small appliance in a recent grad’s new kitchen, make it this one.

Buy now: Instant Pot, $89.95 (On sale from $99.95), Amazon

13. Books!

(Photo: Amazon)

Adjusting to life after college is hard. Your grad might feel lost, confused, and unprepared. Get them a book that will make them laugh, learn, and feel less alone as they try to figure the world out. Here are some great options. The first two happen to best-sellers on Amazon.

*Oh, The Sh!t You Don’t Know!: College Graduation Edition by Antonio Carter

Buy now: $10.40, Amazon

14. A nice wallet

9,"Should the Capitals actually consider trading Alex Ovechkin? Well, it's complicated | FOX Sports","With the dust settling on the wreckage of yet another Washington Capitals season that ended too soon, there are fingers being pointed. That is to be expected.

And, not surprisingly, a lot of those fingers are being pointed at Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin.

This is hardly anything new. Ovechkin is one of the best pure goal scorers of his era – maybe ever – and has been the face of the Capitals since he entered the league as the top overall pick in 2004. But, at 31 years old, he has yet to lead the Caps past the second round of the playoffs.

This season may have held his best chance yet. The Capitals had a great team that finished with the best regular season record in the NHL for the second consecutive year. They were considered to be Cup favorites.

But then, also for the second consecutive year, the Caps were bounced in the second round by the Pittburgh Penguins.

It was a devastating fate for Washington, especially considering this was a beatable Pens team without Kris Letang for the entire series and Sidney Crosby for nearly two full games. The Capitals felt they were the better team – and, for much of the series, they were – but they simply didn’t get the job done.

Again.

Now, with another failure stacked on the pile, a familiar question is arising: Are the Capitals better off without Ovechkin?",fox-sports
9,"Former Ravens, Browns WR Michael Jackson killed in motorcycle accident | FOX Sports","Michael Jackson, who spent eight NFL seasons with the Browns and Ravens in the 1990s and led the league in touchdown catches during the Ravens’ first season in Baltimore, died early Friday morning in a motorcycle accident.

Louisiana police confirmed to TMZ Sports that Jackson, 48, was traveling at a high rate of speed on U.S. Highway 51 in Tangipahoa, La., when his motorcycle crashed into a car that was backing out into the highway. The impact was so strong that the bike reportedly smashed through the driver’s side door and killed both Jackson and the driver of the car.

Jackson was a sixth-round pick by the Browns in 1991 and had three 700-yard receiving years in his first five seasons before his breakout year when the team moved to Baltimore in 1996. He set career highs in receptions (76), yards (1,201) and TDs (14) in that season year as a Raven. He played two more years in Baltimore before injuries cut his career short at age 29.

6,This is the most WTF week in Washington in a long time,"(CNN) Remember that time when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in front of a Senate committee that she had warned White House counsel Don McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target?

That happened less than five days ago.

This week in politics has seemed more like a month as stories -- like the one involving Yates, Flynn and McGahn -- that would have been MASSIVE news in a normal week are forgotten amid the next MASSIVE story to break.

Walk down memory lane with me. And remember that all of these things have happened in the last 96 hours.

Tuesday, May 9

The day is dominated by talk of why Trump didn't fire Flynn for 18 days after Yates told McGahn about her concerns. Then, just before 6 p.m. ET, Trump fires FBI Director James Comey. Minutes later, CNN breaks the news that grand jury subpoenas have been delivered to associates of Flynn in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The White House communications shop goes into panic mode, with press secretary Sean Spicer's now-infamous among-the-bushes-in-the-dark briefing as the highlight/lowlight.

Wednesday, May 10

Vice President Mike Pence goes to Capitol Hill to argue that President Trump fired Comey because of a memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arguing that Comey lost the confidence of the FBI with his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. (Trump would directly contradict that assertion less than 24 hours later.) Then, Trump does a photo-op with former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even while comparisons of his firing of Comey to Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" swirl.

Later, pictures emerge of a smiling Trump shaking hands and laughing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Kislyak at the center of the Flynn investigation. And the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he met with twice during the 2016 campaign, leading to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. The White House later admits it was tricked by the Russians, who used the photos to troll Trump

It makes me tired just writing it all.

The pace at which the news moves in the Trump presidency is, literally, unheard of -- the result of the fast-twitch social media culture, Trump's unpredictability, the level of interest (positive and negative) in everything and he does and, frankly, the long hours he keeps.

It's easy amid the barrage -- and every week has been a maelstrom if not the Category 5 level of this week -- to forget things that happened even a day or two ago.

Some of that is a concerted strategy on Trump's part. If you throw 100 balls into the air every day, no one can catch them all. He has, throughout his life, shown a penchant for using a new headline (of his own making) to bump down a less favorable headline. He thinks and acts like a cable TV producer and he knows that whatever is freshest is what usually dominates.

But there's more here too. The pace at which Trump moves and acts -- and tweets -- often feels manic, as though he is playing right on the edge between strategic and totally out of control.

The events of this week seem to be firmly in the out-of-control space. Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one political/public-relations disaster to another. There appears to be no consistent message, no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one.

The image that keeps coming to my mind is Trump, alone, angry and tweeting, while his staff runs around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire -- even as two more start behind them.

Being unpredictable and unorthodox is one thing. Being totally out of control -- a car with no breaks, a roller coaster car running out of track -- is another. And Trump's White House finds itself jammed into that car -- with no clear sense of where they're headed -- right about now.",cnn
4,When Only Memories Can Fill The Cracks,"When I was a teenager, I drew the floor plan of my house a lot. It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed
9,Is this bicycle kick howler the greatest/worst own goal ever? | FOX Sports,"It’s not often that Swiss soccer highlights make their rounds on the internet, but when something amazing happens and there’s video of it, eventually it’ll make it to the masses.

Such is the case for Pully Football’s Adrien Gulfo, who hit a worldy against FC Renens in the Coupe de Vaudoise semifinal earlier this month. The Pully defender popped up the ball high in the air, timed his leap perfectly to make contact with a bicycle kick that settled delicately into the far corner of the net.

There was just one problem for Gulfo. He hit it into his own net.

So, it’s not ideal. But remove the own-goal aspect from it for just a second and imagine he’s a striker. That angle is unreal. Sure, the keeper might have been on his toes and been more poised to stop the attempt, but what a hit. The good news for Gulfo and Pully is that the world’s most stylish own goal didn’t come back to haunt them.

The match wound up finishing 3-3, and Pully pulled out a 4-3 win in the penalty shootout. They’ll take on Malley in the final on May 25.

6,"Sean Spicer isn't saying whether President Trump tapes his phone calls. Wait, what?","Washington (CNN) Six hours after President Donald Trump implied that he could be taping phone calls with now-deposed FBI Director James Comey , White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to rule that possibility out.

Stop. Go back and read that first sentence again. Ok. Moving on.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer repeated again and again as he was blitzed with questions about the ""tape"" tweet . ""The tweet speaks for itself.""

Deep breath.

So, here's what we know: The president of the United States made a not-so-subtle threat against the FBI director he fired to stay quiet because he might just have recorded the phone calls between the two of them. The White House press secretary, when given a chance to say definitively that no such recording happened, took a pass.

Now ask yourself this: If Trump wasn't recording phone calls, why wouldn't Spicer jump at the opportunity to clarify that as soon as humanly possible? After all, secretly recording phone calls in the White House has been off limits since Richard Nixon did so -- to great personal damage -- during his presidency.

Why, in a week in which Trump is already being compared to Nixon for his firing of Comey, would the White House not immediately swat the story down if it wasn't true?

There are two possible answers to that question as far as I can tell:

Trump refuses to acknowledge he got way over his skis in that tweet Friday morning Trump is recording his phone calls.

I genuinely don't know which one is more likely at this point.

My natural tendency would be to assume that of course Trump isn't recording phone calls because that would be incredibly cavalier and dangerous. But, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. He built a reputation and a career on saying and doing things no one else would even consider saying or doing. And it got him elected president. So, why would he feel constrained once he was sitting in the Oval Office?

On the other hand, Trump is famous (infamous?) for never saying sorry or even looking backward. His stubbornness has caused him and his staff untold agita in his first 112 days in office. One example: Trump's tweet that he was being wiretapped by President Obama during the 2016 campaign has been debunked by everyone in a position to know. And yet Trump stands by it -- trying desperately to find a way out that doesn't involve him admitting he made it up. (His latest tactic is to elide his allegation of wiretapping with the broader surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.)

Which is it then? I genuinely have no idea.

But no matter the reasons for Trump's sort-of insinuation and Spicer's refusal to knock down the idea, we now have real cause to wonder whether this president of the United States has a secret phone recording system up and running.

What a thing to contemplate.",cnn

16,Massive ransomware attack hits 74 countries,"Tens of thousands of ransomware attacks are targeting organizations around the world on Friday.

Security firm Kaspersky Lab has recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries in the past 10 hours. Most of the attacks have targeted Russia.

What is it?

The ransomware, called ""WannaCry,"" locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. Researchers say it is spreading through a Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) Windows exploit called ""EternalBlue,"" which Microsoft released a patch for in March. A hacking group leaked the exploit in a trove of other NSA spy tools last month.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

Sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK have been hit, and some of those hospitals have canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. Spanish telecom company Telefónica was also hit with the ransomware.

Spanish authorities confirmed the ransomware is spreading through the EternalBlue vulnerability and advised people to patch.

""It is going to spread far and wide within the internal systems of organizations -- this is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" UK-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Related: NSA's powerful Windows hacking tools leaked online

Kaspersky Lab says although the WannaCry ransomware can infect computers even without the vulnerability, EternalBlue is ""the most significant factor"" in the global outbreak.

How to prevent it

Beaumont examined a sample of the ransomware used to target NHS and confirmed it was the same used to target Telefónica. He said companies can apply the patch released in March to all systems to prevent WannaCry infections. Although it won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

He said it's likely the ransomware will spread to U.S. firms too. The ransomware is automatically scanning for computers it can infect whenever it loads itself onto a new machine. It can infect other computers on the same wireless network.

""It has a 'hunter' module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks,"" Beaumont said. ""So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.""

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, Friday's attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion. When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.",cnn

All other personal electronics devices will be required to be checked.""

But although the Trump administration is considering whether to ban laptops and other large devices from cabins on flights from Europe to the United States, no such ban is in effect yet. U.S. and European officials have been discussing an expansion this week, but for now, the ban still only applies to flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and Africa.

3,Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld by Italy court,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Francesco Schettino was sentenced in 2015

Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people.

Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said.

Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship.

The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.

More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the Costa Concordia capsized

Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm.

But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.

The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last.

The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.

Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine.

Posted on HTC’s official Twitter account, the teaser is a short, silent video of dirt bikes circling a person, and what appears to be a visual representation of sound waves coming from all directions.

Perhaps more telling than the content though, is the caption, which reads “360 real-life recording.”

It’s all still a bit vague, but recording presumably means either audio or video, and since the HTC U 11 is rumored to have fairly ordinary single-lens cameras on the front and back it’s unlikely that it will be able to shoot 360-degree videos.

Audio though is another matter altogether. HTC’s phones are often known for standout sound and there have already been rumors that the HTC U 11 will have 4 microphones, with the ability to record audio in 3D, for a surround sound effect, so we’d say this teaser is almost a confirmation of that.

Last year's HTC 10 had a similar power, and did certainly shoot brilliant 4K videos (among the best we'd seen on a phone in terms of a video and audio combo) but this could be a bigger step forward.

It might sound like a niche feature, but it has the potential to make videos far more immersive, particularly when recording scenes where sound is key, such as a concert – or, as in the teaser’s example, being circled by dirt bikes.

We’ll know for sure whether this is what HTC is teasing soon, as the HTC U 11 is being revealed on May 16.",techradar

10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Google rolled out new features for its Allo chat app in early May, namely incognito mode for groups, chat backup/restore and link preview. None of these are huge new additions, but it's a sign Google is actively updating Allo, and we'll likely hear much more about it at IO.

Google has also released its official IO 2017 app with new features such as early seat reservations. It's a handy tool for IO attendees, but the app also lets those who can't make it livestream the keynote and sessions on their phone or tablet.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is referring to this year's IO as an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: A general admission Google IO 2017 ticket costs $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks for the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

The theme of this year's conference seems to be ""more,"" with even more sessions still to be announced, more space for developers, more Office Hours and more ways to connect with everything Google announces.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, this session will go over what's new for developers when it comes to Android. This includes the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O has to offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's new & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" as well as go over the work that's already been done in Android Wear and best practices for making apps for the wearable operating system.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build their own. While this may be too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features of the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
6,"As Trump implies there are 'tapes' of talks with Comey, Sean Spicer refuses to answer","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As we continue to follow the developments of FBI Director James Comey’s firing, President Donald Trump continues to add fuel to the fire. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether President Trump tapes his phone calls or conversations with others – including inside the Oval Office.

The startling non-denial at the White House press briefing came just hours after Trump, in what appeared to be a threat to his fired FBI director Friday morning, implied there may be recordings of his conversations with James Comey. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Spicer dodged multiple questions from reporters about whether Trump makes a habit of recording conversations or whether there were recording devices in the room during the meeting with Comey.

""He simply stated the fact. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said. ""There's nothing further to add on that.""

Trump's early morning tweet that set off this firestorm was a clear indication of his defensiveness as the fallout continues from this week's abrupt and controversial firing of Comey, the man who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians seeking to influence the American presidential election.

Yet Trump's tweet this morning was not actually meant as a warning to Comey not to speak to the media, Spicer said. ""That’s not a threat. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As the Trump administration continues to stand by the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the administration continues to fight the 'false narrative' of Trump administration ties with Russia. (May 12) AP

At issue here are the differing accounts of the discussions Trump had with Comey over the FBI's Russia investigation.

In his short termination letter to Comey on Tuesday, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation in the counterintelligence probe. He later elaborated, in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, that those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency's acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

Also, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, cast serious doubt on Trump's claim that Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

Clapper said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.'' In an interview on MSNBC on Friday, Clapper said: ""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI.""

Trump, on the other hand, told NBC a day earlier that Comey had requested the dinner to ask to keep his job after the election. FBI directors, by law, serve 10 year terms; Comey had six more years left.

Since the other assurances Trump mentioned apparently took place by phone, some analysts wondered if Trump's reference to ""tapes"" referred to wiretapping.

In a letter sent to the White House, House Democrats – John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland – called for the release of any tapes and recorded communications between Trump and Comey.

""Under normal circumstances, we would not consider credible any claims that the White House may have taped conversations of meetings with the president,"" they wrote. ""However, because of the many false statements made by White House officials this week, we are compelled to ask whether any such recordings do in fact exist. If so, we request copies of all recordings in possession of the White House regarding this matter.""

Wikileaks also offered $100,000 to anyone who would leak tapes of Trump and Comey's communications.

Some analysts say Trump might not be the only one to be keeping track of conversations. Comey, they said, might have his own written records of his discussions with Trump.

Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: ""Have to presume that Comey kept some kind of record of any conversation he had with the President.""

And Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice during the Obama administration, tweeted: ""One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned.""

Giving more details about the discussions at Friday's briefing, Spicer said Trump was seeking assurances from the FBI director that he wasn't under investigation because he wanted to fight back against ""the narrative"" building around the Russia story.​

Disputing the basis of the Russia investigation, Spicer said, ""There's no collusion that occurred."" In fact, Trump wants investigators to get to the bottom of Russian involvement in the election, Spicer said, so as to debunk the ""false narrative"" that the Trump campaign was somehow involved.

In the Friday briefing, Spicer also denied reports that Trump solicited a loyalty pledge from Comey during their dinner earlier this year.

A New York Times report – one that may have inspired one of Friday's tweets — said Trump asked the FBI director to pledge personal loyalty to him during their dinner. ""Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge,"" the Times reported. ""Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not 'reliable' in the conventional political sense.""

Spicer's briefing began with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster discussing the president's upcoming trip to the Middle East and Europe, despite threats from President Trump earlier in the day threatening to cancel press briefings because he was unhappy with the media coverage of Comey's dismissal.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance. ""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Spicer called the coverage of changing stories behind Comey's dismissal miss the point.

""It's always the president's decision,"" Spicer said.

He did not dispute Trump's suggestion that press briefings should be canceled, saying only, ""I think he's a little dismayed"" by the media coverage.

Trump reiterated the idea of canceling briefings in a separate interview with Fox's Jeanine Pirro. Calling them ""press conferences,"" he characterized the briefings as having ""a level of hostility that’s incredible and it’s very unfair.""

The White House Correspondents Association objected to Trump's threat. Shutting down news briefings, the association said in a statement, ""would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday. (Photo: MariuszBlach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

LONDON — As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday.

The infections have disabled more than a dozen hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain's largest telecom company and universities in Italy as well as some FedEx computers. The payment was demanded per computer, to be paid in Bitcoin, an untraceable digital currency.

Infected computers showed a screen giving the user three days to pay the ransom. After that, the price would be doubled. After seven days the files would be deleted, it threatened.

The ransomware code is named WanaCrypt and has been in use by criminals since at least February. It is available in at least 28 languages, including Bulgarian and Vietnamese, according to Avast, a Czech security company that is following the fast-moving attack.

However, a new variant dubbed WannaCry was created that makes use of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was patched by Microsoft on March 14. Computers that have not installed the patch are potentially vulnerable to the malicious code, according to a Kaspersky Lab blog post on Friday.

The ransomware is believed to be linked to an exploit, computer code that takes advantage of a computer vulnerability, known to have been used by the Equation Group, which many in the security world believe is connected to the National Security Agency (NSA).

That exploit was one of many hacking tools stolen from the NSA and later published online by a group that called itself the Shadow Brokers, according to Avast.

That group has been leaking pieces of more than a gigabyte worth of older NSA software weapons since August.

Avast has recorded over 50,000 attacks globally as of Friday afternoon. The majority are targeted at Russia, the Ukraine and Taiwan but have also hit multiple other countries.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire and Cumbria were affected, according to the BBC. The National Health Service (NHS) said 16 of its organizations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ""ransomware"" attack were demanding $300 worth of the online currency Bitcoin to release files from encryption, the Mirror and Telegraph reported.

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organizations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organizations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organizations to confirm this.""

The NHS said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask users for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack, local media reported.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results. We are dealing with urgent problems only. Our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a campaign which supports NHS staff and is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

WASHINGTON – The nation's former top intelligence official Friday cast serious doubt on President Trump's claim that now-fired FBI Director James Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.''

""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI,'' Clapper said in an interview on MSNBC.

Clapper, a highly-regarded figure during his long service in government, is the latest in a growing number of former and current government officials who have rushed to defend Comey, abruptly dismissed Tuesday. For his own part, Clapper also renounced Trump's assertions that he had had offered an independent finding earlier this week that there was no collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

Trump's explosive claim about Comey came in a Thursday interview with NBC News when he said the director had requested the dinner to express his desire to continue his tenure at the FBI. That would have been an unusual request, since he was in the fourth year of a 10-year term.

But Clapper flatly dismissed Trump's account. According to Comey, the dinner invitation had been extended by Trump, Clapper said. He also said that Trump's claim that Comey sought the meeting to keep his job was completely out of character for the former director.

""I can't imagine him doing that,'' Clapper said in the interview.

In an early Friday flurry of tweets, Trump appeared to threaten Comey from offering a version of the dinner that contradicted the president's, raising the prospect that their meeting had been secretly recorded.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations,'' the president said in a tweet.

Yet one person close to Comey, who was not authorized to comment publicly, flatly dismissed the president's version as not accurate.

Clapper also rejected Trump's assertion that Comey's ouster was necessary because of long-standing ""turmoil'' within the bureau. The former intelligence chief said he regularly interacted with other FBI officials who offered no such assessments.

""From my vantage point, the morale at the FBI was very high,'' Clapper said.

Earlier this week, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel that Comey maintained ""broad support'' within the bureau.

Clapper's unflinching support of Comey came as Trump, in a separate Friday tweet, referred to the former national intelligence director's testimony to a Senate panel earlier this week. Trump said Clapper had publicly insisted there was no collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

However, that's not the full story. Clapper told lawmakers that the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any evidence of collusion. But Clapper also added that he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey disclosed it publicly in March.

""I don't know if there was collusion or not,'' Clapper said Friday in the MSNBC interview.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to dismiss the implications of Clapper's stated lack of knowledge about the ongoing inquiry and his inability to provide a definitive assessment of Russian collusion. ""It sounds like the story has changed,"" Spicer said.

1,David Boren realignment rhetoric should keep Big 12 on edge,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The college football season doesn't start until the fall but it's never too early to start looking ahead. USA TODAY Sports

With David Boren (left), on the dais with commissioner Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 put expansion to rest last fall. But Boren can't resist being restless. (Photo: LM Otero, AP)

He is a lifelong politician, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Oklahoma president David Boren can’t keep his mouth shut when it comes to realignment (even after an attempt to muzzle him was made 15 months ago) and can’t help himself from subtly suggesting — again — that the Sooners’ future may not be in the Big 12 (even as he says he’s all-in with the league).

Boren has become the master of conference realignment doublespeak, never passing up an opportunity to put Oklahoma into wild speculation involving the SEC, Pac 12 or Big Ten.

Here were some of Boren’s choice comments to reporters following a Board of Regents meeting on Thursday, as reported by The Oklahoman.

► “I think it’s very important for us to always have the possibility of making a move if we want to, but I assure you that we don’t have any plans to make a move. That’s just my responsibility to the institution not to get us into a position where we can’t make our own choice when the time comes. … It’s in our interest that the Big 12 succeed. So no, we’re not desperate to go anywhere else.”

(If the goal here is to have conference realignment speculation dominate the summer again while saying nothing of substance, good job!)

MORE COLLEGE SPORTS:

► “I’ve been thinking three or four or five years down the road if there’s any need to make a change, but I haven’t wanted us to extend our grant of rights by 20 years or something like that so that OU would have no choices.”

(At least Boren admits the obvious here. Texas and Oklahoma could ensure the Big 12’s long-term future with one stroke of a pen. Alas, the Big 12’s current grant of rights expires in 2025 and won’t be extended because Texas and Oklahoma don’t want to extend it. So unless there’s a new media deal and grant of rights for the Big 12 in 2022 or so, Texas and Oklahoma will essentially become free agents. If they want to be. Which may or may not happen.)

►“I wouldn’t write the Big 12 off yet. It’s had its struggles and obviously our losing the opportunity or letting the opportunity pass us by to have had a network when, back at the time, the networks would’ve been anxious to have us.”

(If you’re an administrator at, say, Baylor or Texas Tech, it can’t be too reassuring when the Oklahoma president is in “Don’t write us off!” mode while also taking a backhanded swipe at the conference’s inability to get in on the television network madness due to the existence of the Longhorn Network. Good times.)

And then this, from the Tulsa World, which also noted that Boren praised the “stature in the academic community” of the Pac-12 and Big Ten:

► “We wouldn’t walk away from the Big 12 lightly, I’ll put it that way. We don’t have any plans to leave right now. There’s not any active conversation going on.”

(Right now?!! Nobody in the media is going to seize on that qualifier, I’m sure. Whoops, too late.)

Look, it’s no secret Boren lost the battle with Texas that was waged last year when he went public with his desire to expand to 12 teams, re-institute a football championship game and start a Big 12 network, which would have essentially required the Longhorns to give up their own channel (and, given the current cable environment, might not have been feasible anyway). The Big 12 gave Boren one out of three, and yet Oklahoma is still hanging around. For now. And up until the day the Big 12 breaks apart or Boren retires — whichever comes first — he’s going to periodically remind his colleagues that Oklahoma controls its own destiny in the conference realignment discussion.

Whether you consider that a warning or empty rhetoric from the former governor and U.S. senator might depend on the day. Or, to be specific, where a Big 12 team falls in the College Football Playoff rankings in a particular week.

As of right now, the reality for Oklahoma is no different than it was last year or when the realignment landscape started to change: It is in a far weaker league today than it was in May 2010. But it’s not so weak that Texas and Oklahoma can’t save it.

Just as it always was, the handwringing over how many draft picks or Playoff teams the Big 12 produces comes down to Texas being Texas and Oklahoma being Oklahoma. Anything short of that, as we’ve seen the past few years with the Longhorns flailing around the middle of the pack, and it gets dicey for a 10-team league that doesn’t have a great depth of traditionally strong programs.

If Texas football gets its act together under Tom Herman, the Big 12 will suddenly look like a much better neighborhood for Oklahoma. Still, the sudden spate of conversation about Oklahoma’s conference future has to be troubling for the rest of the league after it supposedly put the issue of adding members to bed last fall. Even if it’s based on nothing more than innuendo and a politician’s ego, Boren has kept the story going and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

3,"In-cabin ban on laptops, tablets on flights from Europe to U.S. appears inevitable","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The United States and the United Kingdom are setting new carry-on restrictions for certain flights that ban laptops and other large electronic devices. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

A U.S. ban on laptops and tablets in cabins of trans-Atlantic flights to the United States appeared all but inevitable Friday after Department of Homeland Security officials briefed European governments on a proposal that would affect millions of passengers.

The move, which would impact routes that carry as many as 65 million people a year on over 400 daily flights, would expand a ban already in place for planes flying out of eight Middle East and African countries.

The restriction was introduced in March over fears that bombs or explosive materials could be concealed on electronic devices brought onboard. Cellphones would still be allowed in cabins but virtually every other electronic device would not be permitted and would need to be stowed in checked bags.

One issue that has become a focus for security officials is how to make sure that lithium batteries used in laptops aren't turned into bombs that can be detonated mid-air even if stored in luggage holds.

The United Kingdom has a similar ban in place for some in-bound flights, although its list of targeted countries differs from that of the United States.

Officials from France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy took part in the conference call Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A French official who was briefed about the talks said the Americans announced they wanted to extend the current ban, and the Europeans planned to formulate a response in coming days, according to the Associated Press. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan, said the primary questions revolved around when and how — not whether — the ban would be imposed.

Jenny Burke, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said no final decision has been made on expanding the restriction. But Homeland Security officials met Thursday with high-ranking executives of the three leading U.S. airlines — American, Delta and United — and the industry’s leading U.S. trade group, Airlines for America, to discuss expanding the laptop policy to flights arriving from Europe.

Two airline officials briefed on the discussions said DHS gave no timetable for an announcement, but they were resigned to its inevitability. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.

U.S. airlines say they still hope to have a say in how the policy is put into effect at airports to minimize inconvenience to passengers.

The current ban, which affects about 50 flights per day from 10 cities, does not prevent passengers from checking laptops and other electronic devices into luggage holds.

Still, the move could lead to fewer bookings and would complicate passengers' travel plans. The U.S. is a major destination for Europe-originated flights, with more than 10 million travelers flying there each year from destinations across the continent.

Caroline Bremner, head of travel at research firm Euromonitor International, said that before President Trump took office the U.S. was expected to see 85.2 million airline passenger arrivals by 2020. Under the new administration, arrivals to the U.S. are forecast to drop slightly to 84.2 million for the period.

6,"Sean Spicer isn't saying whether President Trump tapes his phone calls. Wait, what?","Washington (CNN) Six hours after President Donald Trump implied that he could be taping phone calls with now-deposed FBI Director James Comey , White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to rule that possibility out.

Stop. Go back and read that first sentence again. Ok. Moving on.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer repeated again and again as he was blitzed with questions about the ""tape"" tweet . ""The tweet speaks for itself.""

Deep breath.

So, here's what we know: The president of the United States made a not-so-subtle threat against the FBI director he fired to stay quiet because he might just have recorded the phone calls between the two of them. The White House press secretary, when given a chance to say definitively that no such recording happened, took a pass.

Now ask yourself this: If Trump wasn't recording phone calls, why wouldn't Spicer jump at the opportunity to clarify that as soon as humanly possible? After all, secretly recording phone calls in the White House has been off limits since Richard Nixon did so -- to great personal damage -- during his presidency.

Why, in a week in which Trump is already being compared to Nixon for his firing of Comey, would the White House not immediately swat the story down if it wasn't true?

There are two possible answers to that question as far as I can tell:

Trump refuses to acknowledge he got way over his skis in that tweet Friday morning Trump is recording his phone calls.

I genuinely don't know which one is more likely at this point.

My natural tendency would be to assume that of course Trump isn't recording phone calls because that would be incredibly cavalier and dangerous. But, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. He built a reputation and a career on saying and doing things no one else would even consider saying or doing. And it got him elected president. So, why would he feel constrained once he was sitting in the Oval Office?

On the other hand, Trump is famous (infamous?) for never saying sorry or even looking backward. His stubbornness has caused him and his staff untold agita in his first 112 days in office. One example: Trump's tweet that he was being wiretapped by President Obama during the 2016 campaign has been debunked by everyone in a position to know. And yet Trump stands by it -- trying desperately to find a way out that doesn't involve him admitting he made it up. (His latest tactic is to elide his allegation of wiretapping with the broader surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.)

Which is it then? I genuinely have no idea.

But no matter the reasons for Trump's sort-of insinuation and Spicer's refusal to knock down the idea, we now have real cause to wonder whether this president of the United States has a secret phone recording system up and running.

What a thing to contemplate.",cnn

16,Massive ransomware attack hits 74 countries,"Tens of thousands of ransomware attacks are targeting organizations around the world on Friday.

Security firm Kaspersky Lab has recorded more than 45,000 attacks in 74 countries in the past 10 hours. Most of the attacks have targeted Russia.

What is it?

The ransomware, called ""WannaCry,"" locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them. Researchers say it is spreading through a Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) Windows exploit called ""EternalBlue,"" which Microsoft released a patch for in March. A hacking group leaked the exploit in a trove of other NSA spy tools last month.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

Sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK have been hit, and some of those hospitals have canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. Spanish telecom company Telefónica was also hit with the ransomware.

Spanish authorities confirmed the ransomware is spreading through the EternalBlue vulnerability and advised people to patch.

""It is going to spread far and wide within the internal systems of organizations -- this is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" UK-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Related: NSA's powerful Windows hacking tools leaked online

Kaspersky Lab says although the WannaCry ransomware can infect computers even without the vulnerability, EternalBlue is ""the most significant factor"" in the global outbreak.

How to prevent it

Beaumont examined a sample of the ransomware used to target NHS and confirmed it was the same used to target Telefónica. He said companies can apply the patch released in March to all systems to prevent WannaCry infections. Although it won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

He said it's likely the ransomware will spread to U.S. firms too. The ransomware is automatically scanning for computers it can infect whenever it loads itself onto a new machine. It can infect other computers on the same wireless network.

""It has a 'hunter' module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks,"" Beaumont said. ""So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.""

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, Friday's attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion. When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.",cnn
16,Delta flubs electronics ban,"Even airlines are confused by the electronics ban on flights to America.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) briefly posted a sign in its Cincinnati terminal Friday warning international travelers that they would have to check any electronics, other than a cell phone, when flying back to the United States: ""Effective May 12 passengers will only be permitted to carry a cell phone onboard flights returning to the United States. All other personal electronics devices will be required to be checked.""

But although the Trump administration is considering whether to ban laptops and other large devices from cabins on flights from Europe to the United States, no such ban is in effect yet. U.S. and European officials have been discussing an expansion this week, but for now, the ban still only applies to flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and Africa. That rule went into effect in March.

Delta has direct flights from Cincinnati to three foreign airports -- Paris, Toronto and Cancun. Mexico and Canada are not part of the ban discussions as of now. A Delta spokesman apologized for the confusion that the sign caused and said it's been removed. It only appeared in Cincinnati, but it lives on social media.

It was another indication of the difficulty that the Department of Homeland Security has had as it rolls new travel policies.

That original electronics ban was first disclosed in a tweet from Royal Jordanian Airlines, rather than in an official statement from the U.S. government.

3,Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld by Italy court,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Francesco Schettino was sentenced in 2015

Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people.

Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said.

Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship.

The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.

More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the Costa Concordia capsized

Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm.

But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.

The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last.

The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.

Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine.

Five of Schettino's colleagues were also jailed for up to three years in earlier cases.",bbc-news
10,HTC U 11 teaser points to serious audio skills,"While a pressure-sensitive frame is likely to be the highlight of the HTC U11 it’s seemingly not the only trick the phone will have up its sleeve, as a new teaser suggests you’ll be able to record sound in 360 degrees.

Posted on HTC’s official Twitter account, the teaser is a short, silent video of dirt bikes circling a person, and what appears to be a visual representation of sound waves coming from all directions.

Perhaps more telling than the content though, is the caption, which reads “360 real-life recording.”

It’s all still a bit vague, but recording presumably means either audio or video, and since the HTC U 11 is rumored to have fairly ordinary single-lens cameras on the front and back it’s unlikely that it will be able to shoot 360-degree videos.

360 real-life recording. 05.16.17 #BrilliantU pic.twitter.com/2lpipWCcZN11 May 2017

Immersive audio

Audio though is another matter altogether. HTC’s phones are often known for standout sound and there have already been rumors that the HTC U 11 will have 4 microphones, with the ability to record audio in 3D, for a surround sound effect, so we’d say this teaser is almost a confirmation of that.

Last year's HTC 10 had a similar power, and did certainly shoot brilliant 4K videos (among the best we'd seen on a phone in terms of a video and audio combo) but this could be a bigger step forward.

It might sound like a niche feature, but it has the potential to make videos far more immersive, particularly when recording scenes where sound is key, such as a concert – or, as in the teaser’s example, being circled by dirt bikes.

We’ll know for sure whether this is what HTC is teasing soon, as the HTC U 11 is being revealed on May 16.",techradar

10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Google rolled out new features for its Allo chat app in early May, namely incognito mode for groups, chat backup/restore and link preview. None of these are huge new additions, but it's a sign Google is actively updating Allo, and we'll likely hear much more about it at IO.

Google has also released its official IO 2017 app with new features such as early seat reservations. It's a handy tool for IO attendees, but the app also lets those who can't make it livestream the keynote and sessions on their phone or tablet.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is referring to this year's IO as an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: A general admission Google IO 2017 ticket costs $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks for the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

The theme of this year's conference seems to be ""more,"" with even more sessions still to be announced, more space for developers, more Office Hours and more ways to connect with everything Google announces.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, this session will go over what's new for developers when it comes to Android. This includes the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O has to offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's new & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" as well as go over the work that's already been done in Android Wear and best practices for making apps for the wearable operating system.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build their own. While this may be too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features of the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
6,"As Trump implies there are 'tapes' of talks with Comey, Sean Spicer refuses to answer","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As we continue to follow the developments of FBI Director James Comey’s firing, President Donald Trump continues to add fuel to the fire. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether President Trump tapes his phone calls or conversations with others – including inside the Oval Office.

The startling non-denial at the White House press briefing came just hours after Trump, in what appeared to be a threat to his fired FBI director Friday morning, implied there may be recordings of his conversations with James Comey. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Spicer dodged multiple questions from reporters about whether Trump makes a habit of recording conversations or whether there were recording devices in the room during the meeting with Comey.

""He simply stated the fact. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said. ""There's nothing further to add on that.""

Trump's early morning tweet that set off this firestorm was a clear indication of his defensiveness as the fallout continues from this week's abrupt and controversial firing of Comey, the man who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians seeking to influence the American presidential election.

Yet Trump's tweet this morning was not actually meant as a warning to Comey not to speak to the media, Spicer said. ""That’s not a threat. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As the Trump administration continues to stand by the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the administration continues to fight the 'false narrative' of Trump administration ties with Russia. (May 12) AP

At issue here are the differing accounts of the discussions Trump had with Comey over the FBI's Russia investigation.

In his short termination letter to Comey on Tuesday, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation in the counterintelligence probe. He later elaborated, in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, that those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency's acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

Also, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, cast serious doubt on Trump's claim that Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

Clapper said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.'' In an interview on MSNBC on Friday, Clapper said: ""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI.""

Trump, on the other hand, told NBC a day earlier that Comey had requested the dinner to ask to keep his job after the election. FBI directors, by law, serve 10 year terms; Comey had six more years left.

Since the other assurances Trump mentioned apparently took place by phone, some analysts wondered if Trump's reference to ""tapes"" referred to wiretapping.

In a letter sent to the White House, House Democrats – John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland – called for the release of any tapes and recorded communications between Trump and Comey.

""Under normal circumstances, we would not consider credible any claims that the White House may have taped conversations of meetings with the president,"" they wrote. ""However, because of the many false statements made by White House officials this week, we are compelled to ask whether any such recordings do in fact exist. If so, we request copies of all recordings in possession of the White House regarding this matter.""

Wikileaks also offered $100,000 to anyone who would leak tapes of Trump and Comey's communications.

Some analysts say Trump might not be the only one to be keeping track of conversations. Comey, they said, might have his own written records of his discussions with Trump.

Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: ""Have to presume that Comey kept some kind of record of any conversation he had with the President.""

And Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice during the Obama administration, tweeted: ""One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned.""

Giving more details about the discussions at Friday's briefing, Spicer said Trump was seeking assurances from the FBI director that he wasn't under investigation because he wanted to fight back against ""the narrative"" building around the Russia story.​

Disputing the basis of the Russia investigation, Spicer said, ""There's no collusion that occurred."" In fact, Trump wants investigators to get to the bottom of Russian involvement in the election, Spicer said, so as to debunk the ""false narrative"" that the Trump campaign was somehow involved.

In the Friday briefing, Spicer also denied reports that Trump solicited a loyalty pledge from Comey during their dinner earlier this year.

A New York Times report – one that may have inspired one of Friday's tweets — said Trump asked the FBI director to pledge personal loyalty to him during their dinner. ""Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge,"" the Times reported. ""Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not 'reliable' in the conventional political sense.""

Spicer's briefing began with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster discussing the president's upcoming trip to the Middle East and Europe, despite threats from President Trump earlier in the day threatening to cancel press briefings because he was unhappy with the media coverage of Comey's dismissal.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance. ""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Spicer called the coverage of changing stories behind Comey's dismissal miss the point.

""It's always the president's decision,"" Spicer said.

He did not dispute Trump's suggestion that press briefings should be canceled, saying only, ""I think he's a little dismayed"" by the media coverage.

Trump reiterated the idea of canceling briefings in a separate interview with Fox's Jeanine Pirro. Calling them ""press conferences,"" he characterized the briefings as having ""a level of hostility that’s incredible and it’s very unfair.""

The White House Correspondents Association objected to Trump's threat. Shutting down news briefings, the association said in a statement, ""would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday. (Photo: MariuszBlach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

LONDON — As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday.

The infections have disabled more than a dozen hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain's largest telecom company and universities in Italy as well as some FedEx computers. The payment was demanded per computer, to be paid in Bitcoin, an untraceable digital currency.

Infected computers showed a screen giving the user three days to pay the ransom. After that, the price would be doubled. After seven days the files would be deleted, it threatened.

The ransomware code is named WanaCrypt and has been in use by criminals since at least February. It is available in at least 28 languages, including Bulgarian and Vietnamese, according to Avast, a Czech security company that is following the fast-moving attack.

However, a new variant dubbed WannaCry was created that makes use of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was patched by Microsoft on March 14. Computers that have not installed the patch are potentially vulnerable to the malicious code, according to a Kaspersky Lab blog post on Friday.

The ransomware is believed to be linked to an exploit, computer code that takes advantage of a computer vulnerability, known to have been used by the Equation Group, which many in the security world believe is connected to the National Security Agency (NSA).

That exploit was one of many hacking tools stolen from the NSA and later published online by a group that called itself the Shadow Brokers, according to Avast.

That group has been leaking pieces of more than a gigabyte worth of older NSA software weapons since August.

Avast has recorded over 50,000 attacks globally as of Friday afternoon. The majority are targeted at Russia, the Ukraine and Taiwan but have also hit multiple other countries. Russia’s Interior Ministry said Friday it had come under cyberattack.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire and Cumbria were affected, according to the BBC. The National Health Service (NHS) said 16 of its organizations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ""ransomware"" attack were demanding $300 worth of the online currency Bitcoin to release files from encryption, the Mirror and Telegraph reported.

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organizations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organizations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organizations to confirm this.""

The NHS said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask users for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack, local media reported.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results. We are dealing with urgent problems only. Our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a campaign which supports NHS staff and is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

WASHINGTON – The nation's former top intelligence official Friday cast serious doubt on President Trump's claim that now-fired FBI Director James Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.''

""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI,'' Clapper said in an interview on MSNBC.

Clapper, a highly-regarded figure during his long service in government, is the latest in a growing number of former and current government officials who have rushed to defend Comey, abruptly dismissed Tuesday. For his own part, Clapper also renounced Trump's assertions that he had had offered an independent finding earlier this week that there was no collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

Trump's explosive claim about Comey came in a Thursday interview with NBC News when he said the director had requested the dinner to express his desire to continue his tenure at the FBI. That would have been an unusual request, since he was in the fourth year of a 10-year term.

But Clapper flatly dismissed Trump's account. According to Comey, the dinner invitation had been extended by Trump, Clapper said. He also said that Trump's claim that Comey sought the meeting to keep his job was completely out of character for the former director.

""I can't imagine him doing that,'' Clapper said in the interview.

In an early Friday flurry of tweets, Trump appeared to threaten Comey from offering a version of the dinner that contradicted the president's, raising the prospect that their meeting had been secretly recorded.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations,'' the president said in a tweet.

Yet one person close to Comey, who was not authorized to comment publicly, flatly dismissed the president's version as not accurate.

Clapper also rejected Trump's assertion that Comey's ouster was necessary because of long-standing ""turmoil'' within the bureau. The former intelligence chief said he regularly interacted with other FBI officials who offered no such assessments.

""From my vantage point, the morale at the FBI was very high,'' Clapper said.

Earlier this week, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel that Comey maintained ""broad support'' within the bureau.

Clapper's unflinching support of Comey came as Trump, in a separate Friday tweet, referred to the former national intelligence director's testimony to a Senate panel earlier this week. Trump said Clapper had publicly insisted there was no collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

However, that's not the full story. Clapper told lawmakers that the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any evidence of collusion. But Clapper also added that he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey disclosed it publicly in March.

""I don't know if there was collusion or not,'' Clapper said Friday in the MSNBC interview.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to dismiss the implications of Clapper's stated lack of knowledge about the ongoing inquiry and his inability to provide a definitive assessment of Russian collusion. ""It sounds like the story has changed,"" Spicer said.

1,David Boren realignment rhetoric should keep Big 12 on edge,"CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The college football season doesn't start until the fall but it's never too early to start looking ahead. USA TODAY Sports

He is a lifelong politician, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Oklahoma president David Boren can’t keep his mouth shut when it comes to realignment (even after an attempt to muzzle him was made 15 months ago) and can’t help himself from subtly suggesting — again — that the Sooners’ future may not be in the Big 12 (even as he says he’s all-in with the league).

Boren has become the master of conference realignment doublespeak, never passing up an opportunity to put Oklahoma into wild speculation involving the SEC, Pac 12 or Big Ten.

Here were some of Boren’s choice comments to reporters following a Board of Regents meeting on Thursday, as reported by The Oklahoman.

► “I think it’s very important for us to always have the possibility of making a move if we want to, but I assure you that we don’t have any plans to make a move. That’s just my responsibility to the institution not to get us into a position where we can’t make our own choice when the time comes. … It’s in our interest that the Big 12 succeed. So no, we’re not desperate to go anywhere else.”

(If the goal here is to have conference realignment speculation dominate the summer again while saying nothing of substance, good job!)

MORE COLLEGE SPORTS:

► “I’ve been thinking three or four or five years down the road if there’s any need to make a change, but I haven’t wanted us to extend our grant of rights by 20 years or something like that so that OU would have no choices.”

(At least Boren admits the obvious here. Texas and Oklahoma could ensure the Big 12’s long-term future with one stroke of a pen. Alas, the Big 12’s current grant of rights expires in 2025 and won’t be extended because Texas and Oklahoma don’t want to extend it. So unless there’s a new media deal and grant of rights for the Big 12 in 2022 or so, Texas and Oklahoma will essentially become free agents. If they want to be. Which may or may not happen.)

►“I wouldn’t write the Big 12 off yet. It’s had its struggles and obviously our losing the opportunity or letting the opportunity pass us by to have had a network when, back at the time, the networks would’ve been anxious to have us.”

(If you’re an administrator at, say, Baylor or Texas Tech, it can’t be too reassuring when the Oklahoma president is in “Don’t write us off!” mode while also taking a backhanded swipe at the conference’s inability to get in on the television network madness due to the existence of the Longhorn Network. Good times.)

And then this, from the Tulsa World, which also noted that Boren praised the “stature in the academic community” of the Pac-12 and Big Ten:

► “We wouldn’t walk away from the Big 12 lightly, I’ll put it that way. We don’t have any plans to leave right now. There’s not any active conversation going on.”

(Right now?!! Nobody in the media is going to seize on that qualifier, I’m sure. Whoops, too late.)

Look, it’s no secret Boren lost the battle with Texas that was waged last year when he went public with his desire to expand to 12 teams, re-institute a football championship game and start a Big 12 network, which would have essentially required the Longhorns to give up their own channel (and, given the current cable environment, might not have been feasible anyway). The Big 12 gave Boren one out of three, and yet Oklahoma is still hanging around. For now. And up until the day the Big 12 breaks apart or Boren retires — whichever comes first — he’s going to periodically remind his colleagues that Oklahoma controls its own destiny in the conference realignment discussion.

Whether you consider that a warning or empty rhetoric from the former governor and U.S. senator might depend on the day. Or, to be specific, where a Big 12 team falls in the College Football Playoff rankings in a particular week.

As of right now, the reality for Oklahoma is no different than it was last year or when the realignment landscape started to change: It is in a far weaker league today than it was in May 2010. But it’s not so weak that Texas and Oklahoma can’t save it.

Just as it always was, the handwringing over how many draft picks or Playoff teams the Big 12 produces comes down to Texas being Texas and Oklahoma being Oklahoma. Anything short of that, as we’ve seen the past few years with the Longhorns flailing around the middle of the pack, and it gets dicey for a 10-team league that doesn’t have a great depth of traditionally strong programs.

If Texas football gets its act together under Tom Herman, the Big 12 will suddenly look like a much better neighborhood for Oklahoma. Still, the sudden spate of conversation about Oklahoma’s conference future has to be troubling for the rest of the league after it supposedly put the issue of adding members to bed last fall. Even if it’s based on nothing more than innuendo and a politician’s ego, Boren has kept the story going and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

3,"In-cabin ban on laptops, tablets on flights from Europe to U.S. appears inevitable","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The United States and the United Kingdom are setting new carry-on restrictions for certain flights that ban laptops and other large electronic devices. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60

A U.S. ban on laptops and tablets in cabins of trans-Atlantic flights to the United States appeared all but inevitable Friday after Department of Homeland Security officials briefed European governments on a proposal that would affect millions of passengers.

The move, which would impact routes that carry as many as 65 million people a year on over 400 daily flights, would expand a ban already in place for planes flying out of eight Middle East and African countries.

The restriction was introduced in March over fears that bombs or explosive materials could be concealed on electronic devices brought onboard. Cellphones would still be allowed in cabins but virtually every other electronic device would not be permitted and would need to be stowed in checked bags.

One issue that has become a focus for security officials is how to make sure that lithium batteries used in laptops aren't turned into bombs that can be detonated mid-air even if stored in luggage holds.

The United Kingdom has a similar ban in place for some in-bound flights, although its list of targeted countries differs from that of the United States.

Officials from France, Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy took part in the conference call Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A French official who was briefed about the talks said the Americans announced they wanted to extend the current ban, and the Europeans planned to formulate a response in coming days, according to the Associated Press. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan, said the primary questions revolved around when and how — not whether — the ban would be imposed.

Jenny Burke, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said no final decision has been made on expanding the restriction. But Homeland Security officials met Thursday with high-ranking executives of the three leading U.S. airlines — American, Delta and United — and the industry’s leading U.S. trade group, Airlines for America, to discuss expanding the laptop policy to flights arriving from Europe.

Two airline officials briefed on the discussions said DHS gave no timetable for an announcement, but they were resigned to its inevitability. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.

U.S. airlines say they still hope to have a say in how the policy is put into effect at airports to minimize inconvenience to passengers.

The current ban, which affects about 50 flights per day from 10 cities, does not prevent passengers from checking laptops and other electronic devices into luggage holds.

Still, the move could lead to fewer bookings and would complicate passengers' travel plans. The U.S. is a major destination for Europe-originated flights, with more than 10 million travelers flying there each year from destinations across the continent.

Caroline Bremner, head of travel at research firm Euromonitor International, said that before President Trump took office the U.S. was expected to see 85.2 million airline passenger arrivals by 2020. Under the new administration, arrivals to the U.S. are forecast to drop slightly to 84.2 million for the period.

The Chicago Sun-Times ran a cover story featuring Cubs superfan Ronnie “Woo Woo” Wickers, who claimed he was mistreated and targeted by security at Wrigley Field.

The defending World Series champion organization — holding firm that its reasoning for dismissing Wickers was based on no proof of a ticket — jabbed back on its official Twitter account. “Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket?” the Cubs' account tweeted in response to the Sun-Times’ Friday cover picture of Wickers.

@Suntimes Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket? — Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) May 12, 2017

Wickers is one of the most recognizable Cubs fans — he has sung for the 7th inning stretch and was the subject of a fandom documentary, “WooLife”. But he was removed by security from an April 19 game when he couldn’t produce his ticket. The Cubs claimed that Wickers had previously tried to enter the game without a ticket, prompting his ultimate removal.

Cubs spokesperson Julian Green told USA TODAY Sports: ""Throughout the years, Ronnie Wickers has attempted to enter Wrigley Field without a ticket, and he is politely turned away by staff. Wickers, like any other fan or celebrity, must have a ticket to attend a game at Wrigley Field. No exceptions.

""We take ticket integrity seriously, so if you attempt to enter a section in the first or seventh inning, you must produce a ticket when asked. We find it odd that Mr. Wickers is claiming some act of discrimination when he has attended several games since April 19 and received the same courtesy we would provide to all our guests.""

Green added that Wickers’ friend, Scott Miller, refused to show officials an e-ticket for Wickers and himself.

""(Miller) refused and verbally assaulted three members of our guest service staff, including a supervisor, which is a violation of our code of conduct,"" Green said. ""Cursing at our staff will get you and your guests a one-way ticket out of the ballpark, so Mr. Miller should proceed with caution if attending a future game.""

The 75-year-old Wickers, however, believes he was mistreated.

“They just lied about everything. I’m going to fight this with my last breath. I would like to sit down with Mr. Tom Ricketts for 10 minutes and let him roll back the videotape,” Wickers told the Sun-Times.

""This is simple,"" Green, the Cubs spokesman, said. ""Buy a ticket, politely show it when asked and enjoy a great day at the ballpark.""",usa-today

Although some Indigenous peoples in Canada boycott the celebration of Canada Day, many are doing so especially this year for Canada's 150th birthday. Many believe the increased call for celebration is a means of distraction from contemporary Indigenous issues, as well as Canada's history with Indigenous peoples. In short, it feels like a celebration of colonization and genocide. So, ""honouring"" First Nations with cultural appropriation for Canada Day? Triple no.

The maelstrom that followed prompted the owners of the Winnipeg Jets to ban fake headdresses from their games . But cultural appropriation goes beyond headdresses.

That's some expensive cultural appropriation.

Sometimes, cultural appropriation is more subtle. For instance, in 2013, award-winning playwright Colleen Murphy came under fire for her play ""Pig Girl."" why would anyone EVER think a play titled ""Pig Girl"" telling the story of Robert Pickton is a good idea? http://t.co/wFZuMQMubj Yeah. Pig Girl is about Robert Pickton, considered one of the worst serial killers in Canadian history, who murdered women at his pig farm in BC. More specifically, the four-character play focuses on Pickton's victims and, by extension, on missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. The play went on to win a Governor General award. But many people, including the family members of one of Pickton's victims, were not so quick to praise the performance. Mainly, because a white woman felt it was her place to tell the tragic story.

And sometimes, cultural appropriation is just a slap in the face. School stands by decision to invite two white performers in headdresses to tell Indigenous stories https://t.co/apld01cFUf The Fort Nelson Secondary School recently stirred controversy after sharing photos to their Facebook page (which appear to have since been deleted) of white performers dressed up as... I don't really know what we call this. But it's a kick in the balls, especially considering ""real"" Indigenous people from the nearby Fort Nelson First Nation were never asked to present. Maybe because they don't have ""costumes.""

Whether in the form of plagiarism, sexualization, or outright just being an asshole, cultural appropriation is still a Canadian phenomenon in 2017. Instead of worrying about an apology or deleting evidence from social media, why don't we just stop doing it.",buzzfeed

4,We Tried To Copy Kim Kardashian's New Instagram Aesthetic And It Was Hard AF,"Kim has gradually eased back into posting shots that resemble her feed prior to the robbery (vacation shots, shots of her at work) but the sense of intimacy is still there. Additionally, the photos have a vintage quality to them (either because of the way Kim filters her photos, or because she's using actual film like a Polaroid).

Gone were the opulent shots flaunting her wealth and jet set lifestyle, replaced by images of her family (with husband Kanye West and children North and Saint), shots of everyday life (eating, lounging around the house), and simpler vibes (think outfit of the day, but staged at home instead of paparazzi shots).

— We also used the apps VSCO (to adjust everything from the exposure to the contrast) and Snapseed (this added the vintage glow) to filter our photos so they would look like the ones that are on Kim's feed.

— First of all, we weren't looking to copy Kim's poses or pictures. Rather, we wanted to replicate both the aesthetic and vibe of her post-Paris pictures on our own feed for 6-9 pictures.

We wanted to see what it would be like to replicate Kim's new and frankly ICONIC Instagram presence on our own feeds. Would it be difficult? Would we learn anything from the experience? Would Kris Jenner adopt us?

My Instagram is a pretty accurate representation of the things I love. I love national parks, trees, colorful landscapes and situations, and sharing my funky clothing choices. Honestly, before this I hadn't thought much about Kim's Instagram, I knew of it and had the sort of respect one has for another women doing her thing, but it wasn't on my personal radar. I thought my experience would be that of a someone who was present, yet detached. I thought I would glide through this with a filter or two, and some sarcasm.

Many of my photos on Instagram are basic shots of me smiling straight at the camera. I'm still trying to figure out my voice on Instagram which has gone from random photos on a whim, to more polished ""fashion blogger"" style photos. I think Kim is a master of imagery and telling stories through her likeness. I was captivated by her recent turn to the nostalgic, mystery, and vulnerability. Going into it, I was excited and confident that I could apply her aesthetic to my photos.

I think Kim's Instagram is very curated; going through it, it seems like I am getting both an intimate yet outsider's view of her life. I've wanted to make my Instagram grid look more aesthetically pleasing but usually give up because it requires planning the next 3 photos in advance. It'll be cool if this reaches me how to curate my feed better.

I didn't really think about what I posted before... just whatever I felt like. So i never actually really thought about it. I mainly posted photos that I liked or thought looked nice, and to share my life with friends or brag about cool food I'm eating ;) As for KIm, I like that she started having a clear aesthetic. I mainly follow Kim because it's fun to watch that lifestyle from afar.

I found Kim's return to the social media *FASCINATING* (I mean hello, she's like the Michelangelo of Instagram. Or maybe Michelangelo was the Kim K of painting? IDK.) Say what you like about her, but there's no one better at telling a story via how she presents herself to the public — every photo she posts is one more chapter in Kim Kardashian: The Story , unlike most plebeians who are posting basic food shots! That being said, I was actually most intrigued by how I was going to make MY feed look different during the experience. I don't think Kim and I are that different on social media — we both project a confidence and self assuredness, which I think is cool. In some ways, I was nervous this was going to be a little TOO easy!

Honestly, it was really weird. I felt like it made me take the pulse of our culture for a second, and really analyze why Kim Kardashian is the figure she is and how she's molded a reality show franchise into the creation of an icon. It was difficult in the sense that it reminded me of learning how to draw or paint for the first time. It's all about replicating stylistic traits and characteristics, instead of just doing whatever you want. I found that giving up my freedom as an artist was irksome, but at times enlightening. It made me think more about things that I could be adding, or taking away from a photo to give it a certain feeling or sense. People really liked the pictures, and thought they had a mysterious quality.

My strategy was to master the following iPhone photo editing apps VSCO Cam, Snapseed, and UNUM to get the right look. For content, I aimed to capture the mystery and intimacy portrayed through Kim's photos. In her photos, the viewer feels dropped into a weekend afternoon with her family. It's weird but I get a feeling of wanting to hug the subjects in her photos. The biggest challenge for me was running out of ""everyday poses"" that still looked photographable. This challenge was fun because I've never posted photos like these before. I feel like I did pretty well. It did go against my instincts to blur and add grain to the photos since my generation has been conditioned to take the highest definition photos possible. To my surprise, commenters not only noticed this new aesthetic but also really wanted to know what filters I used! I also received positive comments from people who've never commented on my photos before.

Kim's Instagram look is often described as ""vintage"" and ""personal,"" so I thought I'd convey those themes in my own style. The first photo I posted was at a cafe: I do most of my writing there and find that to be a personal activity. But then I was told Kim wouldn't post that! Because the photos we were shown of her feed all had people looking away from the camera, I then posted a photo where I was looking off to the side. I was told I'd done it right this time, so that's what I stuck with. The most difficult part was asking my friends to take pictures of me that are posed but supposed to look candid. A big group walked by during one of them.

It was much harder than I thought. I'm not a model or actor so I never think about how I'm posing my body. It felt weird and sort of narcissistic to do it. But I ended up having fun with it. It was cool to have a reason to post photos, and my strategy was basically try not to quit, keep with it, and challenge myself out of my comfort zone. I started to feel slightly annoyed that i had to edit the photos so much — I'm used to just posting right away. It felt weird to save photos and actually put thought into what they would look like as a group. By the end it started to feel like a burden. Social media isn't a part of my job, it's a fun perk. I'm glad that it's separate from my life and I can do it whenever I feel like. It must be hard for public figures to have it so intertwined, like I have to post everyday, it's a part of my business, it's also how I express myself. Posting on a schedule made it less fun for me.

Since I don't have two kids like Kim, I tried to replicate her vibe of intimacy and confidence in my posts for the week. I think it kind of worked, because by the end of the experience, I was getting called out in the comments for filtering my photos like the Kardashians! That being said, getting it right took a LOT of work. I had to bring outfits to work, as co-workers to take pictures of me, and then take about 20-30 pictures to get ONE picture. And that's BEFORE using three — THREE!!! — apps to get the aesthetic right. Being a Kardashian seems exhausting! By the end of the week I was glad it was over. I was tired of taking pictures every day, I was tired of using all the filters, and I was tired of trying to be like Kim.

Final thoughts:

Kuwilileni: I learned that the Kim K of 5 years ago and the Kim K of today are very different people. She’s been molded by time and circumstance into something deeper then what I perceived her as before. I think her Instragram has a high level of thoughtfulness, each picture crafted to perfectly articulate herself. I've always been a lover of analog photography, and these series of photographs serve as a reminder of why I believe the quality of grain and light can have an affect on mood.

Kane: Overall, I learned that it's super fun to show different sides of your life and that I should experiment more with camera angles, filters, and poses. I learned how creative I can get with Instagram rather than just taking a traditionally ""good"" photo. I have even more appreciation of Kim's grasp of storytelling, marketing, and true mastery over her of image. Going forward, I definitely want explore new and creative ways I can tell my own story through Instagram, and now I have more tools to do so. I will also now start to think about feelings a photo conveys rather than only looking at them technically.

Rachel: It's a skill how Kim controls her narrative partly through her social media. People responded best to my photo where I'm eating Hot Cheetos and browsing the Internet because it's relatable. I think that's why she did the family photo series: celebrities want to be relatable as much as they want to be aspirational. I realized that all of us organize our social media to convey specific things about ourselves.

Ella: Overall, I think she has a really cool aesthetic. I wish that I always had someone to take, style, and help me edit my photos. It definitely takes a lot more work than it seems. I think that what I learned is that I'm pretty low maintenance when comes to social media. Adding extra steps / apps didn't seem worth it. At first I was nervous about posting photos that were a little more intimate or personal than i'm used to but in the end it was fun to open up a little in that way. What i'll take going forward is maybe being more mindful of keeping a photographic aesthetic -- not necessarily Kim's but maybe one that becomes my own.

Sam: I have a newfound respect for the amount of effort Kim K (and other social media stars) put into presenting their lives on social media. Prior to the experience, my idea of ""Instagram"" was taking a cute picture, maybe slapping a filter on it, and posting it. But trying to post like Kim shed some light on how Instagram can be used to tell a story, and the amount of time and consideration that goes in to doing so. Whoever says the Kardashians don't have talent is flat out WRONG.",buzzfeed

9,Adam Petty remembered on anniversary of his passing | FOX Sports,"When people spoke about Adam Petty as he was coming up through the stock-car ranks, the buzz was that he could talk like his father, Kyle, and drive like his grandfather, Richard Petty.

Sadly, Adam never got to realize his full potential as a driver, perishing 17 years ago today in a crash during practice for a NASCAR XFINITY Series race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. He was just 19 years old.

Above all else, Adam shared two things with his famous father and grandfather: The first was the broad, easy Petty grin, a warm and friendly smile for anyone who was near. The second was a devotion to community and serving others.

Although Adam is no longer physically present, his values and his service can still be found at Victory Junction Gang Camp, the camp founded for kids in Adam’s honor.

Victory Junction, in Randleman, North Carolina, enriches the lives of children with serious illnesses by providing life-changing camping experiences that are exciting, fun and empowering, at no cost to children or their families.

To honor Adam’s memory and raise money for Victory Junction, Kyle is getting ready to start his annual Kyle Petty Charity Ride, which begins May 13 in Portland, Oregon, and wraps up May 19 in Milwaukee.

9,Happy Hour practice results for Go Bowling 400 | FOX Sports,"Practice is now complete for Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway following the second of two sessions at the 1.5-mile track on Friday.

Tops in the 85-minute practice was defending race winner Kyle Busch, who ran a best lap of 187.963 miles per hour in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota.

Second fast was Cup Series points leader Kyle Larson at 187.833 mph. Larson was followed by Martin Truex Jr., who topped the speed charts in the morning practice.

Rounding out the top five were Ryan Blaney and Brad Keselowski. Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished ninth.

There was one major incident and it involved points leader Larson.

Just six minutes into practice, Larson got loose in Turn 2 and hit the wall, forcing his Chip Ganassi Racing crew to pull out the team’s back-up car. Later in the session, Larson’s teammate, Jamie McMurray, brushed the wall, but his damage was considerably less.

Larson said he’d been wrestling with his car all day long. “I felt like I was going to crash every lap since we unloaded today,” said Larson. “We only made like seven laps the first practice because I was spinning out every time.”

And it was a problem that was not confined to Larson.

“I’ve been extremely loose all day. I think a lot of people have,” said Larson. “I don’t know why we are all fighting loose, but we made some big adjustments between the two practices there and I was still really loose.”

Also notable in practice: Carl Long practiced for a Cup Series race for the first time since 2009, when he was fined $200,000 for running a borrowed engine that was 0.17 cubic inches too large during practice for the Sprint Showdown last-chance all-star qualifying race at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Long was 39th of 39 drivers in terms of speed, more than three seconds off the top lap turned in the session. But he made it on track, which is what matters.

Cup qualifying is tonight at 6:45 p.m., with the race on Saturday night, with coverage starting at 7 p.m. ET. Both qualifying and the race will be on FS1.

9,Who's winning the Carson Wentz trade: The Browns or the Eagles? | FOX Sports,"Leading up to last year’s NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns were desperate for a quarterback. The Philadelphia Eagles were not. Sam Bradford was entrenched as the starter, giving them a decent, very capable quarterback to go into the season with.

Yet, it was the Eagles who made a shocking move up from No. 8 to No. 2, trading a boatload of picks in order to do so. The trade wound up costing Philadelphia two first-round picks (one in 2017), a third- and fourth-rounder in 2016 and a second-round pick in 2018. The Eagles effectively got Wentz and a 2017 fourth-rounder in exchange for five picks, a haul that looked like a major win for the Browns.

The Browns decided to trade down in both 2016 and 2017, turning those five selections into a whopping nine players.

Incredibly, they’re not done making picks from that monumental trade last year. The Browns still have a first- and second-round pick to use next year as a result of the trade.",fox-sports
9,5 reasons to watch UFC 211: Miocic vs. dos Santos 2 | FOX Sports,"Will Joanna be challenged?

9,No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett admits he ‘can’t be a savior’ for the Browns | FOX Sports,"The Cleveland Browns are in desperate need of a player who can resurrect the franchise and get it back on the winning track. That player will likely be a quarterback one day, but the Browns have yet to find the right man for the job.

Some hope that No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett can save the team on the defensive side of the ball, but even he knows that’s impossible. He admitted as much Friday when speaking about the Browns in 2017.

“It takes a culmination of all these guys coming together and just having the attitude that we’re not going to lose. And that’s what we’re going to do. I can’t be a savior,” Garrett said, via NFL.com. “But I can be the best I can be. I can give it my all and make plays and dominate my side of the field, but it takes all 11 guys with a certain thought process that we’re going to go out there and we’re going to win.”

Garrett is going to be a Day 1 starter for the Browns and is the favorite to win Defensive Rookie of the Year. He has all the makings of a cornerstone defender in the mold of Von Miller and J.J. Watt, which should provide the fan base with some excitement.

That being said, he’s not going to win the Browns games without a lot of help. He’s not going to turn them into a playoff team after they won just one game in 2016.

Garrett said himself that “one person can’t win games,” making it clear that it takes an entire team to have success in the NFL. Sure, his play as a rookie will help the Browns win more often in 2017 – or at least they hope so – but he can’t do it all.

He remains as confident as ever, though, after saying he wants to sack Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger most in the NFL – and he plans to back it up.

“You just gotta back up your words. Don’t be scared from it or don’t shy from it,” Garrett said. “Make sure, if you’re willing to say something, that you worked hard enough and prepared well enough to back those things up.”",fox-sports

6,Source: Comey is 'not worried about any tapes',"The source said of the dinner between Comey and Trump on January 27 that it came at Trump's request and was one-on-one. Trump told NBC he thought Comey asked for the dinner, but the source denied the President's account, saying that if Comey had wanted to dine with Trump, he would have had to put the request in through the deputy attorney general.

""It doesn't work that way. It's ludicrous,"" the source said.

A few days before the dinner, Comey had already been told by the President that he would stay on the job, the source said.

""It is absolutely untrue that Jim asked to have dinner or that he asked to have his job,"" the source said. ""That is a complete fabrication.""

As CNN has previously reported, Comey's refusal to pledge loyalty is one of the reasons the President fired him, the other being the acceleration of the probe into alleged collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, another source close to Comey has said.

The source said Comey knew it was possible he would lose his job, especially when he did not agree to pledge loyalty and later with the fallout over refuting the President's claims that President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower, but he didn't expect it when he was fired.

The source said Comey is likely not going to testify next week to Senate intelligence. As of Friday morning, Comey had not responded to the request.

""He loved his job and the mission,"" said the source, who added, ""he'll be fine.""

The source also confirmed previously reported accounts that Comey learned of his firing by catching it on TV -- initially, Comey thought it was a joke, and teased agents around him for teasing him. Then someone pull him aside and told him it was true, the source said.

The source said Comey thought at least he would get a phone call, adding, ""the way (Trump) did it was remarkable.""

Shifting accounts of firing

The initial, official White House version of how Comey came to be fired was that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , fresh on the job, wrote a memo expressing concern about the way Comey had handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

But mounting evidence suggests Comey was actually fired because of the Russia probe.

Sources have told CNN that Trump's decision to ax Comey was made after he grew increasingly frustrated with him following a congressional hearing last week in which he said he was ""mildly nauseous"" over the idea that he helped sway the 2016 election.

Trump's surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have struggled to keep up with the shifting narrative on how and why the decision was made, and Trump tweeted Friday it was ""not possible"" for his team to recount details and talking points with ""perfect accuracy.""

On Thursday, Trump, discussing the firing of Comey, told NBC News that he was frustrated by the ongoing investigation and believed it was motivated by Democrats' fury at losing the election.

Trump told NBC's Lester Holt: ""And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.'""

Trump also reiterated in the interview Thursday that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation for his campaign's alleged ties to Russian intelligence officials.

""He told me that ... and I've heard that from others,"" Trump told Holt.

The President said Comey told him he was not under investigation once during a ""very nice dinner"" and two other times over the phone -- comments consistent with the letter Trump sent Comey informing him that he had been fired: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,"" Trump wrote.

There are still questions, however, as to whether Comey actually did tell Trump he was not under investigation at the dinner on January 27 and two more times by phone. Those close to Comey tell CNN they find it hard to believe he would speak about an ongoing investigation. Still, the conversations were one-on-one, making it impossible for the sources to know for sure.

One source was unwilling to tell CNN what was said about the investigation except that what was discussed was more nuanced than the way the President described it.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said as well in remarks at a committee markup Thursday that he and ranking member Dianne Feinstein ""heard nothing that contradicted the President's statement"" when Comey briefed them about the targets of the various investigations. Grassley added: ""It would not be appropriate for me to reveal those details before the professionals conducting the investigations are ready.""",cnn
6,"Sean Spicer isn't saying whether President Trump tapes his phone calls. Wait, what?","Washington (CNN) Six hours after President Donald Trump implied that he could be taping phone calls with now-deposed FBI Director James Comey , White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to rule that possibility out.

Stop. Go back and read that first sentence again. Ok. Moving on.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer repeated again and again as he was blitzed with questions about the ""tape"" tweet . ""The tweet speaks for itself.""

Deep breath.

So, here's what we know: The president of the United States made a not-so-subtle threat against the FBI director he fired to stay quiet because he might just have recorded the phone calls between the two of them. The White House press secretary, when given a chance to say definitively that no such recording happened, took a pass.

Now ask yourself this: If Trump wasn't recording phone calls, why wouldn't Spicer jump at the opportunity to clarify that as soon as humanly possible? After all, secretly recording phone calls in the White House has been off limits since Richard Nixon did so -- to great personal damage -- during his presidency.

Why, in a week in which Trump is already being compared to Nixon for his firing of Comey, would the White House not immediately swat the story down if it wasn't true?

There are two possible answers to that question as far as I can tell:

Trump refuses to acknowledge he got way over his skis in that tweet Friday morning Trump is recording his phone calls.

I genuinely don't know which one is more likely at this point.

My natural tendency would be to assume that of course Trump isn't recording phone calls because that would be incredibly cavalier and dangerous. But, this is Donald Trump we're talking about. He built a reputation and a career on saying and doing things no one else would even consider saying or doing. And it got him elected president. So, why would he feel constrained once he was sitting in the Oval Office?

On the other hand, Trump is famous (infamous?) for never saying sorry or even looking backward. His stubbornness has caused him and his staff untold agita in his first 112 days in office. One example: Trump's tweet that he was being wiretapped by President Obama during the 2016 campaign has been debunked by everyone in a position to know. And yet Trump stands by it -- trying desperately to find a way out that doesn't involve him admitting he made it up. (His latest tactic is to elide his allegation of wiretapping with the broader surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.)

Which is it then? I genuinely have no idea.

But no matter the reasons for Trump's sort-of insinuation and Spicer's refusal to knock down the idea, we now have real cause to wonder whether this president of the United States has a secret phone recording system up and running.

6,Comey turmoil puts Trump's isolation on view,"Washington (CNN) Days after his abrupt dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump's attempts to triage the fallout only plunged the episode further into confusion.

Conflicting accounts of how and why the firing happened ricocheted across Washington Thursday, each seeming to push the decision closer to Comey's oversight of an investigation into Russian election meddling.

Trump himself linked the decision to the Russia probe in an interview. His spokeswoman suggested Comey's dismissal could hasten the inquiry.

The turmoil surrounding Comey's dismissal has frustrated the President and his senior-most aides, according to people familiar with the situation. All have expressed anger that the decision to fire Comey wasn't properly executed and created a sharp backlash. The topic has all but consumed the West Wing, where Trump remains holed up Friday, his seventh straight day without a public event.

Attempts to move on from the firing have been minimal. Trump's own official schedule remains empty, leaving some of his allies wondering whether his governing agenda has veered drastically off course. Even the normal parade of photo-ops has been scrapped; instead, Trump signed two executive orders behind closed doors Thursday, avoiding any more questions about his decision to remove Comey from his post.

It all led to the impression of a commander in chief operating in chaotic isolation while leaving even his closest allies to pick up the pieces. Trump seemed to confirm the situation himself on Twitter Friday morning.

'I was going to fire Comey'

There are few signs that the crisis is close to lifting.

On Friday morning, Trump fired off a thinly veiled threat to Comey: ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.""

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

The tweet marks an extraordinary development in the ongoing feud between Trump and the agencies investigating alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.

Trump also threw two days of official White House accounts into dispute by insisting he'd long planned to fire Comey, even before his Justice Department provided him a reason, and suggesting he was thinking about the FBI's Russia investigation when he made the decision.

""When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,' "" Trump told NBC News.

""Regardless of the recommendation,"" Trump told NBC, ""I was going to fire Comey.""

That flew in the face of what his top deputies -- including Vice President Mike Pence -- had said publicly about the incident in the 24 hours after the dismissal. Pence said seven times on Capitol Hill Wednesday that Trump acted only after receiving the recommendation to fire Comey from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump's spokeswoman, explaining her own statements that seemed to be contradicted by the President's interview, said Trump hadn't told her that he was long planning to dismiss his FBI director.

""I hadn't had a chance to have the conversation directly,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday. ""I went off of the information I had when I answered your question. I've since had the conversation with him, right before I walked on today. And he laid it out very clearly. He had already made that decision. He had been thinking about it for months.""

Meanwhile, the FBI's acting director told a congressional panel that Comey enjoyed ""broad support"" at the FBI, further undercutting Trump's explanation that Comey had been dismissed because he'd lost the support of his staff.

Toxic atmosphere

In his interview, Trump said Comey had fostered a toxic atmosphere at the FBI, which his dismissal was meant to remedy. But on Capitol Hill, the agency's acting director denied that rank-and-file agents at the bureau were dissatisfied with their leadership. Instead, he said Comey commanded widespread respect among his employees, including himself.

""I hold Director Comey in the absolute highest regard,"" said the acting director, Andrew McCabe. ""I have the highest respect for his considerable abilities and his integrity.""

He said Comey enjoyed ""broad support within the FBI and still does to this day"" and added ""the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep, positive connection to Director Comey.""

People within the bureau said the firing had caused anger among agents toward Trump. A planned visit by Trump to FBI headquarters this week never materialized.

""He wouldn't have been received well,"" one official said of the President, noting the bureau remains shellshocked over Comey's firing.

At the White House, tensions were high. Many top officials placed blame on the press office for its handling of the situation, though few in the communications wing had advance warning that Trump was planning to fire Comey.

One official called the attempts to handle the aftermath an ""embarrassment. Another termed the cleanup attempts ""a disaster.""

The President himself thought it was ""handled poorly,"" according to one person familiar with Trump's thinking.

The scramble to contain the fallout of Trump's decision reflects a sudden change for a president who, less than a week ago, was celebrating a major victory: passage of a Republican health care plan in the House of Representatives. The moment has proven distracting for a President facing a series of hard decisions about US policy, as well as a grueling five-stop foreign swing that begins in just over a week.

Grudges

Trump himself signaled his continued preoccupation with the matter Thursday afternoon, sending a message on Twitter citing his longtime nemesis, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who called for Comey's dismissal in December.

""We finally agree on something Rosie,"" the President wrote. Moments later, he continued his Twitter tirade: ""Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.""

Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2017

The messages reflected Trump's longstanding preoccupation with the claims his campaign coordinated with Russia during last year's election. Trump has viewed the claims -- along with the FBI investigation into them -- as a challenge to the legitimacy of his presidency, according to people who have spoken with him.

Trump has been nearly perpetually frustrated by Russia probe, which he believes has overshadowed parts of his agenda, according to people familiar with his thinking.

Trump also bore a grudge against Comey for shooting down his claims during public congressional testimony that Trump's phones had been tapped by President Barack Obama's administration, according to sources.

But firing Comey did not end the conversation about the FBI's look into Russian meddling; if anything, the story has emerged with renewed force.

Investigation remains

Trump admitted in his interview with NBC that he'd asked Comey directly whether he was under investigation during a dinner sometime this year, claiming Comey had assured him that he wasn't. Trump said that Comey had requested the dinner ""because he wanted to stay on,"" even though FBI directors serve 10-year terms that span presidential administrations.

Speaking Thursday, McCabe called the Russia inquiry ""highly significant"" and said Comey's firing would not impede the agency's work.

""You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,"" McCabe said.

Meanwhile, at the White House, Trump's spokeswoman suggested that Comey's firing could hasten the FBI's work.

""We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,"" Sanders said, referring to the FBI's probe into Moscow's interference in last year's election. ""And we think that we've actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.""",cnn
6,This is the most WTF week in Washington in a long time,"(CNN) Remember that time when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in front of a Senate committee that she had warned White House counsel Don McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target?

That happened less than five days ago.

This week in politics has seemed more like a month as stories -- like the one involving Yates, Flynn and McGahn -- that would have been MASSIVE news in a normal week are forgotten amid the next MASSIVE story to break.

Walk down memory lane with me. And remember that all of these things have happened in the last 96 hours.

Tuesday, May 9

The day is dominated by talk of why Trump didn't fire Flynn for 18 days after Yates told McGahn about her concerns. Then, just before 6 p.m. ET, Trump fires FBI Director James Comey. Minutes later, CNN breaks the news that grand jury subpoenas have been delivered to associates of Flynn in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The White House communications shop goes into panic mode, with press secretary Sean Spicer's now-infamous among-the-bushes-in-the-dark briefing as the highlight/lowlight.

Wednesday, May 10

Vice President Mike Pence goes to Capitol Hill to argue that President Trump fired Comey because of a memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arguing that Comey lost the confidence of the FBI with his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. (Trump would directly contradict that assertion less than 24 hours later.) Then, Trump does a photo-op with former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even while comparisons of his firing of Comey to Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" swirl.

Later, pictures emerge of a smiling Trump shaking hands and laughing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Kislyak at the center of the Flynn investigation. And the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he met with twice during the 2016 campaign, leading to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. The White House later admits it was tricked by the Russians, who used the photos to troll Trump

It makes me tired just writing it all.

The pace at which the news moves in the Trump presidency is, literally, unheard of -- the result of the fast-twitch social media culture, Trump's unpredictability, the level of interest (positive and negative) in everything and he does and, frankly, the long hours he keeps.

It's easy amid the barrage -- and every week has been a maelstrom if not the Category 5 level of this week -- to forget things that happened even a day or two ago.

Some of that is a concerted strategy on Trump's part. If you throw 100 balls into the air every day, no one can catch them all. He has, throughout his life, shown a penchant for using a new headline (of his own making) to bump down a less favorable headline. He thinks and acts like a cable TV producer and he knows that whatever is freshest is what usually dominates.

But there's more here too. The pace at which Trump moves and acts -- and tweets -- often feels manic, as though he is playing right on the edge between strategic and totally out of control.

The events of this week seem to be firmly in the out-of-control space. Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one political/public-relations disaster to another. There appears to be no consistent message, no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one.

The image that keeps coming to my mind is Trump, alone, angry and tweeting, while his staff runs around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire -- even as two more start behind them.

Being unpredictable and unorthodox is one thing. Being totally out of control -- a car with no brakes, a roller coaster car running out of track -- is another. And Trump's White House finds itself jammed into that car -- with no clear sense of where they're headed -- right about now.",cnn
16,Massive ransomware attack hits 99 countries,"Tens of thousands of ransomware attacks are targeting organizations around the world on Friday.

Cybersecurity firm Avast said it has tracked more than 75,000 attacks in 99 countries. It said the majority of the attacks targeted Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan.

What is it?

The ransomware locks down all the files on an infected computer and asks the computer's administrator to pay in order to regain control of them.

The ransomware, called ""WannaCry,"" is spread by taking advantage of a Windows vulnerability that Microsoft released a security patch for in March. But computers and networks that haven't updated their systems are at risk. The exploit was leaked last month as part of a trove of NSA spy tools.

""Affected machines have six hours to pay up and every few hours the ransom goes up,"" said Kurt Baumgartner, the principal security researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab. ""Most folks that have paid up appear to have paid the initial $300 in the first few hours.""

Sixteen National Health Service (NHS) organizations in the UK have been hit, and some of those hospitals have canceled outpatient appointments and told people to avoid emergency departments if possible. Spanish telecom company Telefónica was also hit with the ransomware.

Spanish authorities confirmed the ransomware is spreading through the vulnerability, called ""EternalBlue,"" and advised people to patch.

""It is going to spread far and wide within the internal systems of organizations -- this is turning into the biggest cybersecurity incident I've ever seen,"" UK-based security architect Kevin Beaumont said.

Russia's Interior Ministry released a statement acknowledging a ransomware attack on its computers, adding that less than 1% of computers were affected, and that the virus is now ""localized."" The statement said antivirus systems are working to destroy it.

Megafon, a Russian telecommunications company, was also hit by the attack. Spokesman Petr Lidov told CNN that it affected call centers but not the company's networks. He said the situation is now under control.

Related: NSA's powerful Windows hacking tools leaked online

Kaspersky Lab says although the WannaCry ransomware can infect computers even without the vulnerability, EternalBlue is ""the most significant factor"" in the global outbreak.

How to prevent it

Beaumont examined a sample of the ransomware used to target NHS and confirmed it was the same used to target Telefónica. He said companies can apply the patch released in March to all systems to prevent WannaCry infections. Although it won't do any good for machines that have already been hit.

He said it's likely the ransomware will spread to U.S. firms too. The ransomware is automatically scanning for computers it can infect whenever it loads itself onto a new machine. It can infect other computers on the same wireless network.

""It has a 'hunter' module, which seeks out PCs on internal networks,"" Beaumont said. ""So, for example, if your laptop is infected and you went to a coffee shop, it would spread to PCs at the coffee shop. From there, to other companies.""

According to Matthew Hickey, founder of the security firm Hacker House, Friday's attack is not surprising, and it shows many organizations do not apply updates in a timely fashion. When CNNTech first reported the Microsoft vulnerabilities leaked in April, Hickey said they were the ""most damaging"" he'd seen in several years, and warned that businesses would be most at risk.

Consumers who have up-to-date software are protected from this ransomware. Here's how to turn automatic updates on.

It's not the first time hackers have used the leaked NSA tools to infect computers. Soon after the leak, hackers infected thousands of vulnerable machines with a backdoor called DOUBLEPULSAR.

Acting FBI Director testified on Thursday

Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey will not testify before the Senate intelligence committee next week, according to the panel's vice chairman, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.

""We just heard from the director that he's not able to make Tuesday,"" Warner told CNN's Manu Raju. ""It's my hope that that we will be able to find a time. I think it's really important that the Congress, and more broadly the American people, hear Director Comey's side of the story.""

Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump on Tuesday, was invited to speak before the committee in a closed session. The former official was in charge of the bureau's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The Virginia Democrat told MSNBC earlier Friday that Comey would not appear next week.

The intelligence committee issued a subpoena this week to former national security adviser Michael Flynn for documents regarding his interactions with Russian officials.

16,Proof that even airlines are confused about the electronics ban,"Even airlines are confused by the electronics ban on flights to America.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) briefly posted a sign in its Cincinnati terminal Friday warning international travelers that they would have to check any electronics, other than a cell phone, when flying back to the United States: ""Effective May 12 passengers will only be permitted to carry a cell phone onboard flights returning to the United States. All other personal electronics devices will be required to be checked.""

But although the Trump administration is considering whether to ban laptops and other large devices from cabins on flights from Europe to the United States, no such ban is in effect yet. U.S. and European officials have been discussing an expansion this week, but for now, the ban still only applies to flights from 10 airports in the Middle East and Africa. That rule went into effect in March.

Delta has direct flights from Cincinnati to three foreign airports -- Paris, Toronto and Cancun. Mexico and Canada are not part of the ban discussions as of now.

3,FBI chief sacking: Trump warns Comey over leaks to media,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump has insisted he was told by Mr Comey that he was not under investigation

US President Donald Trump has warned fired FBI chief James Comey against leaking material to the media.

He tweeted that Mr Comey had ""better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"", suggesting such tapes, if they existed, might contradict him.

Mr Comey, who had been leading an inquiry into possible collusion between Trump election campaign officials and Russia, was fired on Tuesday.

Mr Trump has insisted Mr Comey told him that he was not under investigation.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer later said Mr Trump had nothing more to say on the ""tapes"" but that the tweet the president had put out was ""not a threat"" to Mr Comey.

Read more:

Mr Trump has said that Mr Comey has told him three times that he was not a target of the FBI inquiry, comments that have raised accusations among opponents that the president was interfering in the investigation.

Mr Trump also said this week that he alone was responsible for the decision to sack Mr Comey, calling him a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"".

But this appeared to undermine earlier comments from administration officials that Mr Comey had been fired on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein.

The first line of Mr Trump's letter sacking Mr Comey refers to a memo written by Mr Rosenstein and says: ""I have accepted their recommendation"".

But he later told NBC he was ""going to fire him regardless of the recommendation"".

The White House said Mr Comey was fired over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email affair, but Democrats have asked, if that is the case, why it took so long.

'Flooding the zone': Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher

Donald Trump was reportedly unhappy with how his press team handled fallout from Tuesday's decision to fire Mr Comey, so he's taken things into his own hands. Boy, has he.

First he gave an interview that essentially undercut all the arguments White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, had made to paint the Comey sacking as an operation conducted through normal channels. Now he has taken to Twitter in earnest, spraying a barrage of allegations, accusations and aggressions against Democrats, the media and Mr Comey himself.

In sports terms, the strategy could be described as ""flooding the zone"" - launching a ferocious, full-out assault to overwhelm an opponent's defences. In this case, Mr Trump has the media scrambling to decide which story merits the most coverage.

Is it the details of the Comey-Trump dinner and the president's hints of secret ""tapes""? His threat to cancel press briefings? The Oval Office visit by a Russian entourage? Perhaps, as Mr Trump suggests, the ""real news"" is the tentative trade agreement between the US and China on beef and poultry products?

When everything is a big story, nothing is. At least, that's what Mr Trump may hope.

There is also a suggestion Mr Comey had asked for more resources for the FBI inquiry.

Then there is a New York Times report this week which said that, during a one-on-one dinner in late January, Mr Trump had asked Mr Comey for a pledge of loyalty but it was not forthcoming.

Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC on Friday he had spoken to Mr Comey before the dinner, and the FBI head had said he was ""uneasy"" about it as it might compromise his inquiry.

Mr Spicer later said that the president had not asked for a pledge of loyalty.

'Witch hunt'

Apparently angered by criticism of the different accounts of the sacking, Mr Trump used another of his tweets on Friday to say: ""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!""

He added: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

Mr Spicer said the president was a ""little dismayed"" that the attempts of his press team to give out information were being turned into a ""game of gotcha"" by the media.

It was unclear whether Mr Trump's reference to ""tapes"" suggested there might be secret recordings of conversations that could be used to challenge any statements by Mr Comey, or whether it was simply a way of warding him off from commenting.

Mr Spicer said he was not aware of any recording of the dinner with Mr Comey.

The reference to tapes has done nothing to silence the echoes of the Watergate affair that have resounded around the Russian interference inquiry.

CNN cited an unnamed source as saying Mr Comey was ""not worried about any tapes"" Mr Trump may have of their conversations.

Mr Trump has dismissed the FBI investigation as a ""charade"" and has said Democrats are using ""fake news"" about collusion with the Russians as an excuse for losing the election.

In another tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said: ""When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?""

Chelsea secured their fifth Premier League title with a dramatic late victory at West Brom.

Substitute Michy Batshuayi scored in the 82nd minute to secure the vital win, sliding in to turn home Cesar Azpilicueta's cut-back from close range.

After nearest rivals Tottenham lost against West Ham on 5 May, Chelsea needed only two wins from their final four matches to take the trophy.

They convincingly beat Middlesbrough 3-0 on Monday and wrapped things up with victory at The Hawthorns.

Chelsea were made to work hard on the night by a resolute West Brom.

The Blues had 14 shots on goal in the first half, including Cesc Fabregas' bending effort which went wide.

Victor Moses struck through the legs of James McClean, only to be denied by a brilliant save from Ben Foster after the break.

West Brom took control of the match, as Salomon Rondon's shot deflected wide after a rapid counter-attack and Nacer Chadli clipped his effort past the post.

But then Batshuayi scored his second league goal of the season, sending the Chelsea players and manager Antonio Conte into frenzied celebrations.

Conte becomes only the fourth manager to lift the Premier League trophy in his first season in England, emulating Jose Mourinho in 2004-05, Carlo Ancelotti in 2009-10 and Manuel Pellegrini in 2013-14.

And the Italian has claimed a fourth successive league title as a manager - adding to the three Serie A trophies he won with Juventus.

Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people.

Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said.

Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship.

The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio.

Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.

More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation.

Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm.

But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.

The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last.

The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.

Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine.

You might be thinking, ‘wait a minute, didn’t the Creators Update just roll out?’ And you’d be right, but Microsoft says their not done making its operating system even better for creative types.

Windows Story Remix

At the center of this upcoming Windows 10 build is a new creative app called Windows Story Remix. Its most interesting aspect is that it allows users to create mixed reality content. Microsoft demoed the app by adding 3D objects to photos and video to help tell stories users can explore.

Otherwise, the new app is essentially about helping users create shareable memories out of their photos and videos by automatically stitching them together. From there, users can add little creative touches like a soundtrack, theme, cinematic transitions (read: star wipes), or even draw and write on them with Windows Ink.

The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will hit many of the best 2-in-1 laptops

Windows Story Remix is also a collaborative app, that allows users to share media. For example multiple parents could all shoot different angles of a soccer game and the app will automatically pull together the footage to create a highlight reel.

With face recognition, users could also tell Windows Story remix to make a certain person the start of the video.

While this app is currently untitled, it seems like it will be an interesting new wrinkle to the Windows 10 experience and feels like a perfect fit for Windows 10 Mobile and its lineup of smartphones – which we have no doubt it will land on eventually.

Image 1 of 3 Windows 10 is getting a big makeover Image 2 of 3 Hello white taskbar Image 3 of 3 Apps get a new look too

Fluent Design System

At the heart of the Fall Creators Update is a new user interface called the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which both changes the look and how you interact with apps. Originally code named Project Neon , Fluent Design will drive more expressive and engaging apps for a wide range of devices.

Secondly, the new design language hopes to tackle input diversity head on. With a modern Windows 10 device, users can interact with touch, ink, voice, gaze and gesture. Simply put, Fluent Design hopes to create a more harmonious and responsive cross-device experience.

Pick up and go

Speaking of cross-device experiences, the Fall Creators Update comes with new features specifically designed for those who flip from one device to the next.

Microsoft introduced Timeline to help users jump back into what they were working on. It works by showing users a visual timeline of their desktop so they can get right back into the files, apps and sites they were accessing at the time. At a basic level, it’s a lot like MacOS’ Time Machine, but for revisiting your desktop state from an earlier time and place.

Beyond your PC, Cortana enables the same Pick Up Where You Left Off across a wider variety of Windows, iOS and Android devices. Microsoft gave the example of being able to work on a doc on the PC and Cortana asking a user whether they would like to finish it up on a phone.

Last but not least, Clipboard brings universal copy and paste to Windows devices and beyond. Aside from just clipping text and web links, Clipboard also allows users to transfer photos and animated GIFs from a Windows PC to their preferred mobile device.",techradar
10,HTC U 11 teaser points to serious audio skills,"While a pressure-sensitive frame is likely to be the highlight of the HTC U11 it’s seemingly not the only trick the phone will have up its sleeve, as a new teaser suggests you’ll be able to record sound in 360 degrees.

Posted on HTC’s official Twitter account, the teaser is a short, silent video of dirt bikes circling a person, and what appears to be a visual representation of sound waves coming from all directions.

Perhaps more telling than the content though, is the caption, which reads “360 real-life recording.”

It’s all still a bit vague, but recording presumably means either audio or video, and since the HTC U 11 is rumored to have fairly ordinary single-lens cameras on the front and back it’s unlikely that it will be able to shoot 360-degree videos.

360 real-life recording. 05.16.17 #BrilliantU pic.twitter.com/2lpipWCcZN11 May 2017

Immersive audio

Audio though is another matter altogether. HTC’s phones are often known for standout sound and there have already been rumors that the HTC U 11 will have 4 microphones, with the ability to record audio in 3D, for a surround sound effect, so we’d say this teaser is almost a confirmation of that.

Last year's HTC 10 had a similar power, and did certainly shoot brilliant 4K videos (among the best we'd seen on a phone in terms of a video and audio combo) but this could be a bigger step forward.

It might sound like a niche feature, but it has the potential to make videos far more immersive, particularly when recording scenes where sound is key, such as a concert – or, as in the teaser’s example, being circled by dirt bikes.

We’ll know for sure whether this is what HTC is teasing soon, as the HTC U 11 is being revealed on May 16.",techradar

Amazon Kindle deals for Mother's Day

Amazon Kindle Paperwhite

'Amazon Kindle' is basically synonymous with 'ereader', and this Mother's Day, the 6-inch slates are also synonymous with 'savings'.

Amazon is knocking $20 off the price of all of its e-readers: the standard Kindle now costs $59.99, the Kindle Paperwhite is now $99.99 and the Kindle Voyage is just $179.99. All of these include Special Offers.

Special Offers, by the way, are sponsored content that appear as screensavers when an Amazon device is in sleep mode. You typically pay more for devices that don't have them.

The recently redesigned Kindle is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and coupled with a lower price, it's the best affordable ereader on the market.

The Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Voyage offer sharper screens and Wi-Fi, and with these Mother's Day discounts, there's probably no better time to buy one.

Of course, Amazon's top-of-the-line ereader won't be left out: you can purchase the Kindle Oasis with Free 3G + Wi-Fi for $309.99 with Special Offers this week, a savings of $50.

Amazon Kindle bundle deals for Mother's Day

10,"Google IO 2017: dates, schedule and rumors for Google's big developer conference","Update: Google rolled out new features for its Allo chat app in early May, namely incognito mode for groups, chat backup/restore and link preview. None of these are huge new additions, but it's a sign Google is actively updating Allo, and we'll likely hear much more about it at IO.

Google has also released its official IO 2017 app with new features such as early seat reservations. It's a handy tool for IO attendees, but the app also lets those who can't make it livestream the keynote and sessions on their phone or tablet.

Original article below...

Google IO, the search giant's annual developer conference, is almost here. Actually, let's try that again: Google is referring to this year's IO as an ""outdoor developer festival"", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and so much more.

The Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif.

The official Google IO 2017 schedule is also out now, letting attendees and those watching from home get a taste of what Google has cooking.

We're still digesting everything Google announced at IO 2016, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat , the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.

This year's event looks to be just as jam-packed, so if you're a developer interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop on over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited in order to register). Attending IO is no cheap trip: A general admission Google IO 2017 ticket costs $1,150 (about £930, AU$1,535).

While this ""festival"" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.

Google IO 2017 schedule

Google has announced a ton of talks for the Google IO 2017 schedule , and here's some great news if you're unable to attend in person: Every technical session, all 150+ of them, will be livestreamed.

The theme of this year's conference seems to be ""more,"" with even more sessions still to be announced, more space for developers, more Office Hours and more ways to connect with everything Google announces.

Google is also doing something different this year and hosting an hour-long Developer Keynote at 1pm PT on May 17, shortly after the main keynote wraps up. This will give developers a chance to gain deeper insight into how they can utilize everything Google just announced.

A few sessions to highlight from the current schedule are:

What's New in Android : 2pm - 3pm PT May 17. In what will likely be the most well-attended and widely watched session of IO, this session will go over what's new for developers when it comes to Android. This includes the Android O Developer Preview SDK, Support Libraries and what Google says will be ""other new and exciting developments."" Expect plenty of details on what Android O has to offer both developers and users.

Android Wear: What's new & Best Practices : 9:30am - 10:30am PT on May 18. This session will ""introduce new features of the next release of Android Wear,"" as well as go over the work that's already been done in Android Wear and best practices for making apps for the wearable operating system.

What's new for Android TV : 10:30am - 11:30am PT on May 18. Here, developers will learn all the latest on the Android TV front, including new APIs, features and future platform improvements.

Introduction to Android Instant Apps : 1:30pm - 2:30pm PT on May 18. In what will likely be a key theme of the show, this session will go over Instant Apps for developers, including how to build their own. While this may be too technical for regular users, it's a sign Google will devote plenty of time - and probably officially roll out - Instant Apps at the show. Here's more on why this is a good thing for users .

Google promises more talks are on the way, so we'll keep this page updated with anything that sounds interesting between now and May 17. To get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!

Say hello to Android O

The star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.

While we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another public submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.

What will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case with Android O.

But what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.

One of the most exciting features of the early build is 'Background limits'. This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.

Android O also currently houses picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.

One final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth to your devices.

As Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, also look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.

What's the word on Android Wear 2?

Android Wear 2 launched in February, so while it's unlikely Google will announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.

For starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.

We wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2 apps are announced, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.

With Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.

Google Home invasion

Google introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write ""Google"" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features made available to the original.

One of the more robust rumors is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.

Considering Google already has the Project Fi and Google Voice services, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which puts the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.

Another report, this time from early April , says Google is considering an updated Home smart speaker that doubles as a mesh Wi-Fi router.

The device would act as a personal assistant and internet router in one, and presumably like Google Wifi would need multiple units to create a mesh network.

A few points against updated hardware or major new features are that Google Home added one of its most requested features, multiple user support , in mid-April and the device just went on sale in the UK. Still, if Google is working to improve Google Home, chances are we'll see whatever is in store at IO.

Google Chrome improvement

Another area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and this could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.

The most likely developments we'll hear about are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.

There are also whispers spreading Google is preparing an ad-blocker built into Chrome. It's almost impossible ad revenue-dependent Google would block every ad on Chrome, so it's more likely Google will introduce a tool that filters out the most offending ads. Perhaps we'll meet this quasi-ad blocker at IO.

New Google Pixel phones? Perhaps

Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL are in the works.

It's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.

Not only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, and if a recent Google investment in LG Display is anything to go by, the new Pixel phones will have curved OLED screens.

Virtual reality, Chromecast and everything else

There's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we might see:

Like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2 headset, but we'll undoubtedly have news on the VR front from the Big G. These could include a headset price reduction, or updates related to how developers create and publish content for virtual reality.

With Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , as Google recently told us, we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.

On the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 . This would certainly make sense, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the IO cards.

Another possible topic are updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.

We could also be in for a new Chromecast as it's been some months since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale. At one time the best selling streaming video device, Google may look to recapture some of that old Chromecast magic with a new and improved device.

Google is also interested in getting Assistant into more devices. The search giant released a developer preview Google Assistant SDK in late April, letting anyone build the digital helper into any device they create. While many of these gadgets will be of the prototype variety, expect some commercial products to hit the market with Assistant in tow. We'll likely hear plenty more about this initiative during IO.

The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.

Google recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.

This is not to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January. And with video app Google Duo adding voice-only calling on April 10, the chat app waters have gotten even muddier.

(Image: © Google)

What is clear is that there are one too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps the Big G will finally drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.

This was in an effort to ""focus and prioritize"" on the features and apps Google deems most important, and could be just the start of a chat service spring cleaning we'll see the culmination of at IO.

Another likely announcement is the Allo desktop and/or web app, both of which have been teased by Google execs. Users are especially keen to get Allo on the desktop, and it's a good bet Google won't want to disappoint.",techradar
10,TCL eyes the throne as one of the world's top TV makers,"“It can be overwhelming to walk into a retailer and see all the TVs on the wall. All their settings are cranked up to compete with one another,” Chris Larson, Senior Vice President, TCL tells us at a recent briefing held at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, Calif.

The discussion was about how TCL TVs … well, all TVs really, are calibrated differently for stores than they are for your home. It’s a trick TV manufacturers have been using for years – turning saturation levels up to sickening levels while cranking the brightness up to its maximum level. It’s intense, definitely, and more than a little deceitful.

But let’s not focus on that god-awful practice for a minute. Let’s focus on the wall of TVs.

For anyone who knows the difference between a composite and component cable, this wall is a visual chocolate factory – each television offering a different flavor of eye candy. We love walking into a Best Buy or Tesco to see what’s new in the world of pixels and panels. We comment on how this LG OLED might look better than Samsung’s new QLED screen, at least in terms of contrast, and quibble over whether Android TV is the best or the worst thing to ever happen to televisions in the last century.

But for others, like my parents, this section of the store – and in particular this wall of TVs – is nothing but a bunch of seemingly identical screens. Who makes a better OLED really isn’t on their list of concerns. I’ve tried to explain Quantum Dot, Dolby Vision, HDR and dozens of other technologies over the years to my parents and, honestly, they’re not interested. As long as the TV looks good and doesn’t cost much, they’re happy.

If you want to know how TCL (an acronym that at one point stood for True China Lion) became the third largest TV manufacturer in the world, it’s through people like my parents.

Quality, performance and value

Sorry, that last bit makes it sound like TCL doesn’t make very good TVs. They do. I mean, they’re not exceptional in the same way the LG Signature Series W7 OLED or the Samsung Q9F QLED TV are, but they’re quite good – especially now that they support Dolby Vision.

The reason for my visit to Dolby Labs was to check out TCL’s 2017 line-up. Two series from last year are getting a refresh (the P- and S-Series) while TCL is introducing a completely new line called the C-Series that taps into contemporary aesthetics and adds support for most HDR sources.

These TVs look good and, according to Larson, will also be priced fairly. If you’re looking for a way to help differentiate TCL from the masses of TVs on the aforementioned wall, it’s their brand promise: Delivering uncompromised experiences at a recognized value with an attractive cosmetic.

It’s a promise that seems to be harder and harder to keep every year now that new Chinese TV makers like Hisense and LeEco have moved into the market. To me, this seems like something worth fretting over, but it didn’t seem to scare anyone in that office.

Oprah might give away cars, but Ellen's got TVs covered.

Larsen told me there were already branding programs in place to help make TCL a household name. “We have a partnership with the Ellen Show and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Plus, we acquired the TCL Chinese Theater down in L.A.” Other ties include UCLA athletic teams, the San Jose Earthquakes (a MLS team based in Northern California) and the Rose Bowl, one of the biggest football games in the NCAA.

And while the list is impressive, I’m not sure a few sponsorship deals will be enough to beat out the most ubiquitous names in television like Sony, Samsung and LG – each of whom have a long and storied career in American families’ living rooms. But maybe it will be.

The grand plan

So what’s the end goal here? If TCL got this far in the TV world without an insane amount of brand recognition, why does it want to change anything?

According to Larsen, it's easy to sell smaller value TVs. It’s a crowded market, sure, but in the end value always beats out performance. But being the main screen in the house? That’s much, much harder. To get to the coveted center of the home you’ve not only got to look good in terms of picture quality and cost less than everyone else, but you need a decent design aesthetic, too.

And according to Aaron Dew, Director of Product Development at TCL, that’s where this year’s all new C-Series come in.

The new series will go on sale in late June and combines “contemporary design” (Dew’s words) and the latest in 4K HDR technology. As far as operating systems go, the TVs use Roku OS 7.5 – a close relative of the operating system used on Roku streaming boxes like the Roku Ultra, Roku Premiere+ and Roku Express.

The C-Series will come in 55-, 65- and 75-inch versions and will include both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. (HLG is something TCL is looking into, but not actively including on any TV this year.) They'll feature wide color gamut with advanced LED phosphor for more realistic colors, brighter highlights and increased light-to-dark contrast and support almost 100% of the DCI-P3 color space.

I left the demo impressed with what I saw. The Dolby Vision integration helped add some pizzazz to TCL’s panels, while Roku OS provided a familiar face that I knew could help me find the content I’ve been looking for.

And yet, I couldn’t help but think back to that wall.

When TCL’s latest series make it to showrooms in late June, will my parents be blown away by Dolby Vision? Will they care that the 2017 P-Series now has 72 Contrast Control Zones that increase contrast and clarity? Maybe. Maybe not.

But considering that TCL’s 55-inch C-Series TV, the 55C807, goes for $699 (around £540, AU$950), I guess it doesn’t matter.",techradar
3,"Massive, fast-moving cyberattack hits as many as 74 countries","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Hackers launched a massive cyber attack. They hit 74 countries. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has that story. Buzz60

As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday. (Photo: MariuszBlach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

LONDON — As many as 74 countries have been hit by a huge, fast-moving and global ransomware attack that locks computers and demands the digital equivalent of $300 per computer, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity company, said Friday.

The infections have disabled more than a dozen hospitals in the United Kingdom, Spain's largest telecom company and universities in Italy as well as some FedEx computers. Ransomware encrypts the files on a computer or network demanding that payment be made in Bitcoin or another untraceable digital currency before the criminals will unlock the files.

Infected computers showed a screen giving the user three days to pay the ransom. After that, the price would be doubled. After seven days the files would be deleted, it threatened.

In Spain, the largest telecommunications company reportedly would have had to pay close to $550,000 to unlock all the encrypted computers hit on its network.

The ransomware code is named WanaCrypt and has been in use by criminals since at least February. It is available in at least 28 languages, including Bulgarian and Vietnamese, according to Avast, a Czech security company that is following the fast-moving attack.

However, a new variant dubbed WannaCry was created that makes use of a vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was patched by Microsoft on March 14. Computers that have not installed the patch are potentially vulnerable to the malicious code, according to a Kaspersky Lab blog post on Friday.

First appearance early Friday

The attack seems to have first appeared around 2 am ET on Friday in Europe, said Kurt Baumgartner, a principal security researcher with Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.

""It's very well-written code and there is no easy way to crack the encrypted files once they're infected,"" he said.

The ransomware is believed to be linked to an exploit, which is computer code that takes advantage of a computer vulnerability, known to have been used by the Equation Group, which many in the security world believe is connected to the National Security Agency (NSA).

That exploit was one of many hacking tools stolen from the NSA and later published online by a group that called itself the Shadow Brokers, according to Avast. That group has been leaking pieces of more than a gigabyte worth of older NSA software weapons since August.

Avast has recorded over 50,000 attacks globally as of Friday afternoon. The majority are targeted at Russia, the Ukraine and Taiwan but have also hit multiple other countries. Russia’s Interior Ministry said Friday it had come under cyberattack.

Perpetrators unknown

Exactly who is behind the attack is unknown.

Kasperksy's Baumgartner did note that although the ransomware was able to offer ""how to pay"" documents in dozens of languages, the only language whose writing was perfect was Russian, with the others showing distinct signs that a non-native speaker had written them. ""The English is very good, but there are a couple of quirks that would lead me to believe it wasn't written by a native English speaker,"" he said.

Also unknown is whether there are multiple coordinated attacks underway. It's also possible that the code was released once and is now working its way around the globe.

It's moving so quickly in part because the exploit it's based on may allow it to because of a so-called ""spreader"" element it contains that allows it to spread quickly.

While the full code hasn't yet been studied it's possible that each computer network would only need to be infected once via a phishing attack, when a user unwittingly opened an email or clicked a link containing the ransomware malicious code.

That code might then be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the computer’s code to spread across any network it was a part of, said Philip Reitinger, president of the non-profit Global Cyber Alliance.

Sometimes called a “wormable” vulnerability, it is considered very serious because of the speed at which worms can infect and jump from system to system, he said.

Services in London, the central city of Nottingham, and the counties of Hertfordshire and Cumbria were affected, according to the BBC. The National Health Service (NHS) said 16 of its organizations reported they were victims.

The hackers behind the ransomware attack were demanding $300 worth of the online currency Bitcoin to release files from encryption, the Mirror and Telegraph reported.

No evidence 'patient data has been accessed'

In a statement, the NHS said: ""A number of NHS organizations have reported to NHS Digital that they have been affected by a ransomware attack which is affecting a number of different organizations. The investigation is at an early stage but we believe the malware variant is Wanna Decryptor.""

""At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed. We will continue to work with affected organizations to confirm this.""

The NHS said the attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and was affecting other organizations. It said it was working to resolve the problem.

Hackers behind the Wanna Decryptor virus, a type of malware, often ask users for money to retrieve access to files they have encrypted.

NHS Merseyside, which operates a number of hospitals in northwestern England, tweeted, “we are taking all precautionary measures possible to protect our local NHS systems and services.” The NHS Merseyside website was down Friday afternoon local time.

East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which runs four hospitals north of London, said in a statement: ""Immediately on discovery of the problem, the trust acted to protect its IT systems by shutting them down; it also meant that the trust’s telephone system is not able to accept incoming calls.”

It said it was postponing all non-urgent work and asked people not to come to the accident and emergency unit.

Doctors at some surgeries were forced to use pen and paper to record patient details following the attack.

John Caldwell, a doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian he had “no access to record systems or results.""

Chris Mimnagh, another doctor in Liverpool, told the Guardian: “Unable to access our clinical system – as a precaution our area has severed links to the wider NHS, which means no access to our national systems, no computers means no records, no prescriptions, no results. We are dealing with urgent problems only. Our patients are being very understanding so far.”

NHS Million, a campaign which supports NHS staff and is separate from the NHS, tweeted: ""We just don't understand the mentality of some people. The only people suffering are people that need emergency care. #nhscyberattack""

Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60

White House spokesman Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to confirm or deny whether President Trump tapes his phone calls or conversations with others – including inside the Oval Office.

The startling non-denial at the White House press briefing came just hours after Trump, in what appeared to be a threat to his fired FBI director Friday morning, implied there may be recordings of his conversations with James Comey. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Spicer dodged multiple questions from reporters about whether Trump makes a habit of recording conversations or whether there were recording devices in the room during the meeting with Comey.

""He simply stated the fact. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said. ""There's nothing further to add on that.""

Trump's early morning tweet that set off this firestorm was a clear indication of his defensiveness as the fallout continues from this week's abrupt and controversial firing of Comey, the man who was overseeing an ongoing FBI investigation into whether Trump's campaign associates colluded with Russians seeking to influence the American presidential election.

Yet Trump's tweet this morning was not actually meant as a warning to Comey not to speak to the media, Spicer said. ""That’s not a threat. The tweet speaks for itself,"" Spicer said.

CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share As the Trump administration continues to stand by the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says the administration continues to fight the 'false narrative' of Trump administration ties with Russia. (May 12) AP

At issue here are the differing accounts of the discussions Trump had with Comey over the FBI's Russia investigation.

In his short termination letter to Comey on Tuesday, Trump made a specific point of mentioning that he ""appreciated"" how the FBI told him three times he was not personally under investigation in the counterintelligence probe. He later elaborated, in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, that those conversations took place twice in phone calls and once at a private dinner with the FBI director.

FBI officials have questioned Trump's claims, and the agency's acting director, Andrew McCabe, on Thursday said such assurances about the scope of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation would not be ""standard practice.''

Also, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, cast serious doubt on Trump's claim that Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

Clapper said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.'' In an interview on MSNBC on Friday, Clapper said: ""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI.""

Trump, on the other hand, told NBC a day earlier that Comey had requested the dinner to ask to keep his job after the election. FBI directors, by law, serve 10 year terms; Comey had six more years left.

Since the other assurances Trump mentioned apparently took place by phone, some analysts wondered if Trump's reference to ""tapes"" referred to wiretapping.

In a letter sent to the White House, House Democratic leaders called for the release of any tapes and recorded communications between Trump and Comey. Trump’s early Friday warning even of the prospect of “tapes,"" they said, “raised the specter of possible intimidation and obstruction of justice.’’

""Under normal circumstances, we would not consider credible any claims that the White House may have taped conversations of meetings with the president,"" Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in a letter to White House Counsel Donald McGahn. ""However, because of the many false statements made by White House officials this week, we are compelled to ask whether any such recordings do in fact exist. If so, we request copies of all recordings in possession of the White House regarding this matter.""

Wikileaks also offered $100,000 to anyone who would leak tapes of Trump and Comey's communications.

Some analysts say Trump might not be the only one to be keeping track of conversations. Comey, they said, might have his own written records of his discussions with Trump.

Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted: ""Have to presume that Comey kept some kind of record of any conversation he had with the President.""

And Matthew Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice during the Obama administration, tweeted: ""One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned.""

Giving more details about the discussions at Friday's briefing, Spicer said Trump was seeking assurances from the FBI director that he wasn't under investigation because he wanted to fight back against ""the narrative"" building around the Russia story.​

Disputing the basis of the Russia investigation, Spicer said, ""There's no collusion that occurred."" In fact, Trump wants investigators to get to the bottom of Russian involvement in the election, Spicer said, so as to debunk the ""false narrative"" that the Trump campaign was somehow involved.

In the Friday briefing, Spicer also denied reports that Trump solicited a loyalty pledge from Comey during their dinner earlier this year.

A New York Times report – one that may have inspired one of Friday's tweets — said Trump asked the FBI director to pledge personal loyalty to him during their dinner. ""Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge,"" the Times reported. ""Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not 'reliable' in the conventional political sense.""

Spicer's briefing began with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster discussing the president's upcoming trip to the Middle East and Europe, despite threats from President Trump earlier in the day threatening to cancel press briefings because he was unhappy with the media coverage of Comey's dismissal.

""As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future ""press briefings"" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

In a striking reversal one day earlier, Trump told NBC News that he planned to fire Comey even before meeting with top-ranking Justice Department officials and soliciting their recommendations on his performance. ""I was going to fire regardless of (their) recommendation,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, calling Comey a ""showboat"" and ""grandstander"" who led the agency into turmoil.

He also specifically brought up the ongoing Russia investigation. ""In fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself – I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,"" Trump told NBC. ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""

These reasons contradicted the White House's assertions — and even the widely disseminated termination letter Trump sent Comey — that the dismissal was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who criticized Comey's handling of the email investigation into Hillary Clinton last year.

Spicer called the coverage of changing stories behind Comey's dismissal miss the point.

""It's always the president's decision,"" Spicer said.

He did not dispute Trump's suggestion that press briefings should be canceled, saying only, ""I think he's a little dismayed"" by the media coverage.

Trump reiterated the idea of canceling briefings in a separate interview with Fox's Jeanine Pirro. Calling them ""press conferences,"" he characterized the briefings as having ""a level of hostility that’s incredible and it’s very unfair.""

The White House Correspondents Association objected to Trump's threat. Shutting down news briefings, the association said in a statement, ""would reduce accountability, transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned.""

Former NFL receiver Michael Jackson was killed early Friday morning in a motorcycle accident just outside of Tangipahoa, La.

Jackson, 48, played for the Cleveland Browns from 1991-95 and the Baltimore Ravens from 1996-98.

Jackson's motorcycle slammed into the driver's side door of a car driven by Destiny Gordon of Kentwood, La., killing both.

According to a news release from the Louisiana State Police, ""(Jackson) was riding a 2013 Kawasaki motorcycle northbound on US 51 at a high rate of speed. Gordon was driving a 2014 Chevrolet Malibu. As Gordon was backing from a parking space, she backed across both lanes of US 51 into the path of (Jackson’s) motorcycle. The motorcycle crashed into the driver’s side door of the Malibu.""

The report said that Jackson was wearing a helmet and Gordon was properly restrained in the car.

Michael Jackson was more than a great player, he was a great man.

Jackson was drafted by the Browns out of Southern Mississippi, where his quarterback was Brett Favre. In three of his seasons in Cleveland, he played for Bill Belichick. After five years in Cleveland, he finished with 2,797 receiving yards and 28 touchdowns. His breakout season was 1996 with the Ravens -- their first year in Baltimore after the move from Cleveland -- when he was sixth in the league in receiving yards (1,201) and was tied for the lead in touchdown receptions with 14.

After retirement, Jackson turned to politics. After an unsuccessful run for the Louisiana State House, he was elected mayor of Tangipahoa, his hometown, in 2009 and served until 2013.

CBS beefed up its 2017-18 primetime slate Friday, adding four new dramas and two new comedies. The network had previously announced a third comedy, Young Sheldon, a prequel spinoff of hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory.

The new shows will feature many familiar faces, including Alan Cumming (The Good Wife), David Boreanaz (Bones), Shemar Moore (Criminal Minds), Bobby Moynihan (Saturday Night Live) and Mark Feuerstein (Royal Pains).

MORE: TV cancellation watch

The new dramas are:

WASHINGTON – The nation's former top intelligence official Friday cast serious doubt on President Trump's claim that now-fired FBI Director James Comey told the president that he was not a target of an ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials at a private White House dinner in January.

James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence who was with Comey in the hours before the Jan. 27 dinner, said the director was ""deeply uneasy'' about the meeting – but ultimately accepted the president's invitation out of ""professional courtesy.''

""He was uneasy with it just for the optics of compromising the independence of the FBI,'' Clapper said in an interview on MSNBC.

Clapper, a highly-regarded figure during his long service in government, is the latest in a growing number of former and current government officials who have rushed to defend Comey, abruptly dismissed Tuesday. For his own part, Clapper also renounced Trump's assertions that he had had offered an independent finding earlier this week that there was no collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government.

Trump's explosive claim about Comey came in a Thursday interview with NBC News when he said the director had requested the dinner to express his desire to continue his tenure at the FBI. That would have been an unusual request, since he was in the fourth year of a 10-year term.

But Clapper flatly dismissed Trump's account. According to Comey, the dinner invitation had been extended by Trump, Clapper said. He also said that Trump's claim that Comey sought the meeting to keep his job was completely out of character for the former director.

""I can't imagine him doing that,'' Clapper said in the interview.

In an early Friday flurry of tweets, Trump appeared to threaten Comey from offering a version of the dinner that contradicted the president's, raising the prospect that their meeting had been secretly recorded.

""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations,'' the president said in a tweet.

Yet one person close to Comey, who was not authorized to comment publicly, flatly dismissed the president's version as not accurate.

Clapper also rejected Trump's assertion that Comey's ouster was necessary because of long-standing ""turmoil'' within the bureau. The former intelligence chief said he regularly interacted with other FBI officials who offered no such assessments.

""From my vantage point, the morale at the FBI was very high,'' Clapper said.

Earlier this week, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told a Senate panel that Comey maintained ""broad support'' within the bureau.

Clapper's unflinching support of Comey came as Trump, in a separate Friday tweet, referred to the former national intelligence director's testimony to a Senate panel earlier this week. Trump said Clapper had publicly insisted there was no collusion between Trump associates and Russia.

However, that's not the full story. Clapper told lawmakers that the intelligence community’s report on Russian hacking, which he oversaw, did not include any evidence of collusion. But Clapper also added that he was unaware of the ongoing FBI investigation until Comey disclosed it publicly in March.

""I don't know if there was collusion or not,'' Clapper said Friday in the MSNBC interview.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to dismiss the implications of Clapper's stated lack of knowledge about the ongoing inquiry and his inability to provide a definitive assessment of Russian collusion. ""It sounds like the story has changed,"" Spicer said.

WASHINGTON – An interim FBI director could be named as soon as Friday, Justice Department officials said.

Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said that acting director Andrew McCabe, who was appointed following Tuesday's abrupt firing of Director James Comey, would remain as deputy director if he was not chosen as the new interim chief.

In addition to McCabe, Flores said that Justice officials were reviewing four candidates, including three current FBI division chiefs. They are:

Adam Lee , chief of the FBI’s Richmond, Va., office. Prior to that, Lee oversaw the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In that role, Lee led the bureau’s investigations of elected and appointed government officials and civil rights violations.

Justice officials have said that the interim appointee could also be considered as an official nominee to succeed Comey, who was dismissed just four years into his 10-year term.

Meanwhile, the White House earlier this week said Trump is considering ""several individuals"" to replace Comey.

While they wouldn't discuss potential candidates to replace James Comey permanently, attention was focused on at least seven candidates, which in addition to McCabe include: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Milwaukee County Sheriff Dave Clarke; South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy; former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly; former FBI agent and former Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers, and John Pistole, a former deputy FBI director and Transportation Security Administration director.

BOSTON — Sian-Pierre Regis was in Paris when his mother left him a voicemail that he will never forget: “I just got fired, just want you to know that. Call me. Bye.”

His 75-year-old housekeeper mother, Rebecca Danigelis, had been working in hospitality for as long as Regis could remember.

“We were raised above a hotel,” Regis says. Danigelis raised two boys by herself in Boston, over the hotel where she worked.

“I was always very aware of the fact that everything she made went into our mouths,” Regis remembers about his childhood with his brother. She cashed out her 401k to help Regis go to college. He went on to live his dreams, while hers were set aside.

Then she got fired.

Regis decided it was time for his mother to live her dreams. He wanted to help her live her best life, and he wanted them to do it together.

The bucket list

Danigelis had been working on a bucket list of things she’s always wanted to do. “When she got fired,” says Regis, “all these bucket list items took on so much more weight.”

She added a few more items to the list and together they set off to live her dreams.

“There is a spirt within her that I’ve never seen so bright.” Sian-Pierre Regis

Some of the things on her list were pure fun: Take a hip-hop lesson with a dancer from the award-winning Broadway musical Hamilton, join Instagram, milk a cow in Vermont, take a mystery trip.

But some of her bucket list items were deeper and more meaningful to her, like visiting the grave of her sister in England.

Danigelis missed her sister’s funeral because she was working. She couldn’t find someone to cover her shift, so she didn’t attend. Standing over her sister’s grave, she sobbed, saying, “I wish I had come sooner.”

“I could see all the memories of she and her sister flooding towards her, she just felt horrible,” Regis says.

No regrets

Regis says his mother has been reflective about missing out on so many things in her life, but she says she would never change any of it. “She had to put food on the table,” he said. And her boys always were her priority.

As mother and son toured the world, ticking off her bucket list items, the duo has shared many laughs.

“There is a spirit within her that I’ve never seen so bright, she’s 75 but I’ve never seen her younger than in these moments,” Regis says.

Next chapter

This dynamic duo isn’t done with mom’s bucket list. Danigelis has yet to skydive or walk the Boston Marathon route, something she plans on doing with both her sons. She is actively looking for a job in hospitality, but says she is having trouble finding an employer who is seeking someone her age.

Regis has filmed their adventure since the beginning, hoping to share his mother’s struggle with the world, but also give her something she can cherish forever. “She’s always wanted to write a memoir,” Regis says. “So many people in their day-to-day jobs render that dream impossible, but now through this film, she’s able to tell her story and be in control of this story.”

They will continue completing items on mom’s bucket list through the end of 2017. Regis has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for production costs for his mother's film, which they've titled Duty Free.

In the meantime, follow her adventures on Instagram and Facebook. And if you see Danigelis painting a picture of her neighborhood in Boston’s Back Bay, know that she’s fulfilling another one of her dreams.

The Chicago Sun-Times ran a cover story featuring Cubs superfan Ronnie “Woo Woo” Wickers, who claimed he was mistreated and targeted by security at Wrigley Field.

The defending World Series champion organization — holding firm that its reasoning for dismissing Wickers was based on no proof of a ticket — jabbed back on its official Twitter account. “Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket?” the Cubs' account tweeted in response to the Sun-Times’ Friday cover picture of Wickers.

@Suntimes Anyone else you want us to let in without a ticket? — Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) May 12, 2017

Wickers is one of the most recognizable Cubs fans — he has sung for the 7th inning stretch and was the subject of a fandom documentary, “WooLife”. But he was removed by security from an April 19 game when he couldn’t produce his ticket. The Cubs claimed that Wickers had previously tried to enter the game without a ticket, prompting his ultimate removal.

Cubs spokesperson Julian Green told USA TODAY Sports: ""Throughout the years, Ronnie Wickers has attempted to enter Wrigley Field without a ticket, and he is politely turned away by staff. Wickers, like any other fan or celebrity, must have a ticket to attend a game at Wrigley Field. No exceptions.

""We take ticket integrity seriously, so if you attempt to enter a section in the first or seventh inning, you must produce a ticket when asked. We find it odd that Mr. Wickers is claiming some act of discrimination when he has attended several games since April 19 and received the same courtesy we would provide to all our guests.""

Green added that Wickers’ friend, Scott Miller, refused to show officials an e-ticket for Wickers and himself.

""(Miller) refused and verbally assaulted three members of our guest service staff, including a supervisor, which is a violation of our code of conduct,"" Green said. ""Cursing at our staff will get you and your guests a one-way ticket out of the ballpark, so Mr. Miller should proceed with caution if attending a future game.""

The 75-year-old Wickers, however, believes he was mistreated.

“They just lied about everything. I’m going to fight this with my last breath. I would like to sit down with Mr. Tom Ricketts for 10 minutes and let him roll back the videotape,” Wickers told the Sun-Times.

""This is simple,"" Green, the Cubs spokesman, said. ""Buy a ticket, politely show it when asked and enjoy a great day at the ballpark.""",usa-today

4,Here’s What Indigenous Cultural Appropriation Is And Why Canada Needs To Stop Doing It,"Everything about this is a mess.

2017 also happens to mark the 150th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada. Which is why this mas band thought it was a good idea to ""celebrate"" with this. A Carnival band has designed Indigenous costumes to celebrate Canada's 150th. A CityNews viewer says it's offensive… https://t.co/4YLq7ZVfLQ

Toronto-based mas band Carnival Nationz previewed two of their designs called, ""Oh Kanata"" and ""One Nationz"" ahead of the annual Toronto Caribbean Carnival. Both designs featured headgear styled in reference to sacred Indigenous headdresses.

And there were a lot of feelings. Even about the way CityNews Toronto chose to word their tweet. @CityNews Indigenous ""costumes"" are actually called regalia and portraying Native traditional wear as a costume can… https://t.co/aa0WiGNqut

@CityNews I am proud of my Caribbean culture. However on this, members of Indigenous community should have been engaged.

@CityNews Why are you even asking?

Now, if you're not quite sure ~why~ this is a bad thing, we'll break it down for you. Not only did Carnival Nationz get accused of appropriating Indigenous culture; people were pretty pissed that it was meant to be a celebration of Canada's 150th birthday.

Which Indigenous peoples have some... varying opinions on. @IPSMO1 Ottawa 2017: 150 Years of Genocide #canada150 #decolonize

Although some Indigenous peoples in Canada boycott the celebration of Canada Day, many are doing so especially this year for Canada's 150th birthday. Many believe the increased call for celebration is a means of distraction from contemporary Indigenous issues, as well as Canada's history with Indigenous peoples. In short, it feels like a celebration of colonization and genocide. So, ""honouring"" First Nations with cultural appropriation for Canada Day? Triple no.

Yikes. Cultural appropriation is also especially bad when it's supposed to be sexy. Nah @CNzInc, you guys screwed this one up. You don't get to steal the culture of Indigenous Canadians and claim it'… https://t.co/539uJzqoRK

Some thought it was a positive display of ""cultural appreciation."" Carnival Nationz wins this year. Really pulled through with some beautiful costumes. Thank god.

The Facebook post was originally shared over 2,500 times and commented on over 2,000 times in 24 hours. View this post on Facebook facebook.com

Now, this is what mas band costumes usually look like. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

And this is what female powwow dancers at Gathering of Nations looked like. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

Just to clarify, this is okay. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

And this is okay, too. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

This, on the other hand, is questionable. View this photo on Instagram instagram.com

The mas band's costumes brought up the discussion of headdresses, too. Also can we please acknowledge that Indigenous ppls have multiple cultures, and that this particular style of headdress is specific?

Recently, a teen apologized for cultural appropriating a headdress at Coachella. Welp, weekend 2 of #Coachella2017 had at least a few headdress offenders. I can't believe we're still dealing w/thi… https://t.co/aSLJ0NmN8O

Not only is the headdress considered a sacred object, it's also commonly viewed as "" pan-Indigenous "" (a term referring to the misconception/stereotype that all Indigenous people dress the same, look the same, etc.). View this photo on Instagram instagram.com That's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and National Chief Perry Bellegarde of the Assembly of First Nations.

Many chiefs reserve wearing of the headdress for special occasions and ceremonial purposes. (A.K.A. Not Coachella)

It is something to be treated with respect. This is Chief Red Cloud's warbonnet. This is who & what we rep. Honor the ancestors.

Native people culturally appropriate, too. First Nations Chicago Blackhawks fan wears fake headdress to a game and confuses everyone: http://t.co/uofAok6IHX In 2015, a man named Rob Bear stirred controversy after he was shown on-air wearing a headdress and drinking beer. He was reportedly approached at the Winnipeg Jets vs Chicago Blackhawks game but refused to take the headdress off.

The maelstrom that followed prompted the owners of the Winnipeg Jets to ban fake headdresses from their games . But cultural appropriation goes beyond headdresses.

While many people believe the past Miss Universe Canada and Carnival Nationz' costumes honour the first peoples of Canada, some are still pretty heated over the outright ""sexualization"" of First Nations culture. Chief calls for feathered bonnet and First Nations-inspired costumes to be pulled from Toronto Caribbean Carnival https://t.co/uRgHArOC39

In a statement on Facebook , Carnival Nationz apologized for the costumes. But, they didn’t say whether they’d still be worn to the carnival. View this post on Facebook Facebook: carnivalnationz

This all comes less than a month after a non-Indigenous Toronto artist was called-out for cultural appropriation of Native artwork. For anyone trying to decide whether Amanda PL is ""influenced"" or straight up copying NM. I offer this side by side… https://t.co/2dEwTTZlyV

The Canadian artist, known as Amanda PL, claimed to be ""inspired"" by the work of renowned Anishinaabe artist Norval Morrisseau. But people were quick to call the art out for being a ""rip-off.""

@AylanX Not content on just ripping off Morriseau #AmandaPL also plagiarized Corey Bulpitt & Larissa Healey

She signs her name in fucking syllabics, y'all. Don't give me your ""be niece to this well intentioned White Girl"" b… https://t.co/IRYJSinrpT

Amanda PL isn't the first non-Indigenous Canadian artist to be accused of plagiarism. Beautiful. Our Home and Native Land by Canadian female artist Jennifer Adomeit #cdnpoli #canada150 #cdngov #CAN2017… https://t.co/ijFQtqxoBk This piece, by Jennifer Adomeit, is being sold on Etsy for a whopping $200. That's some expensive cultural appropriation.

Sometimes, cultural appropriation is more subtle. For instance, in 2013, award-winning playwright Colleen Murphy came under fire for her play ""Pig Girl."" why would anyone EVER think a play titled ""Pig Girl"" telling the story of Robert Pickton is a good idea? http://t.co/wFZuMQMubj Yeah. Pig Girl is about Robert Pickton, considered one of the worst serial killers in Canadian history, who murdered women at his pig farm in BC. More specifically, the four-character play focuses on Pickton's victims and, by extension, on missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. The play went on to win a Governor General award. But many people, including the family members of one of Pickton's victims, were not so quick to praise the performance. Mainly, because a white woman felt it was her place to tell the tragic story.

And sometimes, cultural appropriation is just a slap in the face. School stands by decision to invite two white performers in headdresses to tell Indigenous stories https://t.co/apld01cFUf The Fort Nelson Secondary School recently stirred controversy after sharing photos to their Facebook page (which appear to have since been deleted) of white performers dressed up as... I don't really know what we call this. But it's a kick in the balls, especially considering ""real"" Indigenous people from the nearby Fort Nelson First Nation were never asked to present. Maybe because they don't have ""costumes.""

Whether in the form of plagiarism, sexualization, or outright just being an asshole, cultural appropriation is still a Canadian phenomenon in 2017. Instead of worrying about an apology or deleting evidence from social media, why don't we just stop doing it.",buzzfeed

4,'Snatched' Is Proof That The White-Women-Behaving-Badly Comedy Needs To Take A Break,"Emily Middleton, the thirtysomething New Yorker that Amy Schumer plays in Snatched, is a gross miscalculation of a character. But that realization takes a while to settle in. From afar, Emily looks like she might be a variation on the comedic persona Schumer has honed and weaponized in her standup and on her TV series, Inside Amy Schumer. You know the type — the Schumerian hot mess, the one who shuts the bar down, who’s unruffled to find herself waking up next to a stranger, who’s ditzy and lazy, and who parties and selfies as hard as she can to escape her feelings of inadequacy.

When Emily describes her plans for her upcoming Ecuadorian vacation to someone, they consist of how she hopes to transition from poolside cocktails in the day to red wine and then scotch at night. But after she’s divested of her retail job and her musician boyfriend (a welcome cameo from Randall Park) in quick succession, she’s left with no one to take with her on the nonrefundable trip. No one, that is, except for her divorced, anxiety-ridden mother, Linda (Goldie Hawn, making a questionable choice for her first role in 15 years), a necessity the film treats as deeply embarrassing. And so the two women travel to a resort, and soon find themselves kidnapped and held for ransom, then figure out a way to flee their captors and end up getting lost in the Amazon. It’s a misadventure in which Hawn acquits herself better as the neurotic straight woman than Schumer does as, basically, an asshole. Snatched, which is directed by 50/50’s Jonathan Levine and written by Katie Dippold (of The Heat, Ghostbusters, and this legendary tweet), is a talent-packed, terrifically unfunny movie that, more than anything else, underscores just how difficult it is to translate Schumer’s sharp-elbowed stylings to the conventions of a movie.

This was a challenge for her first big-screen leading role in Trainwreck, too, a better film that reveled in her character’s sloppy, standards-defying splendor only to then “solve” her with monogamy and sobriety. Snatched does much worse by having Emily let it all hang out without a hint of the savage self-awareness or sly feminism with which Schumer, not always perfectly, infused her show. Emily is Schumer’s vapid white girl schtick shorn of any of the underlying commentary, the movie treating her terribleness as endearing, right on through the two people she accidentally murders (lol!). That Snatched plays those incidents for uncertain laughs is an indication of how unsure it is of who it’s making fun of. It makes a joke about Linda’s xenophobic fears by having her mishear a “welcome” cocktail as being full of “whale cum” and react in horror, but it also affirms them by having her and her daughter abducted by a group of glowering South American stereotypes who prey on female tourists. Their leader, the crime lord Morgado (Óscar Jaenada), lambasts the Americans who come to his country only to stay in the resorts, but Snatched presents itself as one big warning against leaving those luxury confines. It’s on a day trip in the company of a suave but possibly sinister Brit (Tom Bateman) that the women get grabbed, and in their subsequent escape, they trek miles through the wilderness, get infected with tapeworms, and almost fall off a cliff. Meanwhile, Ike Barinholtz, as Emily’s agoraphobic brother, tries to annoy the State Department into helping out, and Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack get underused as a pair of platonic (they insist) fellow vacationers with a particular set of skills. More than anything else, Snatched feels like an exhausted dead end for a type of comedy that Schumer and Lena Dunham, in particular, became famous for in the last decade — a comedy that consists of pitilessly self-lacerating white-women-behaving-badly scenarios that leans into its characters’ uglier tendencies while also inquiring into the standards by which those characters get judged.",buzzfeed

4,When Only Memories Can Fill The Cracks,"When I was a teenager, I drew the floor plan of my house a lot. It helped me tell stories about my family, where it was important to understand the view I had from my bedroom, or that there was a dividing half-wall between the kitchen and the living room in an otherwise open concept house. I’d draw lines to illustrate the trajectory of our tiny dog, who’d ricochet against the fridge, scramble down the hallway, bank off the doorframe into my parents’ bedroom, and steal a pair of socks. If I adjusted the scale of my drawing, I could show how close the house was to a nearby conservation area, and to the river beside where I’d sneak cigarettes and spray myself with CK One perfume before returning home, as though my mother wasn’t wise to the fact that the wooded areas of Guelph don’t smell like department store fragrance. My parents sold that house last fall, and moved into my mother’s childhood home — Nonna’s house, to me. Nonna is still alive, but her dementia means she’s been relocated to a retirement community, leaving her house empty. It wasn’t an easy process: My parents, looking to downsize, hadn’t found anything suitable after two years of looking. And Nonna, fiercely independent and living alone since the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier, wasn’t ready to let the house leave the family. She might not have ever moved were it not for the dementia, which, as a byproduct of its gradual erasure of Nonna’s memory, had made it dangerous for her to live alone. Once my parents bought the house, they began the physically necessary but emotionally taxing work of making it their own: a full reno, new appliances, new furniture. In addition to Nonna herself, most of the stuff that reminded me of her — the baby-blue shag carpet, the just-for-show purple towels in the upstairs bathroom, the Jesus portrait hanging above the staircase — is gone too. Nonna, for most of my life, would spend hours in conversation with me — in person at her house in Guelph, then over the phone once I moved to Toronto. Last time I saw her, she remembered me as her “granddaughter,” and that took 30 minutes. Nonna is physically recognizable to me, but the version of her who exists in my mind — the woman who anchored my family down — now lives only in the objects I connected to my formative memories of her: The kitchenwares, framed photographs, and textiles that were split among her living family members after my parents bought the house. They were once just home furnishings, but are now a direct line to a person in the midst of being erased. When I think of my parents’ new house, I draw the floor plan to Nonna’s house in my head. Then I fill it with all her physical belongings, the ones that still remind me of her, the ones I couldn’t save and that I’ll never see again. Even though Nonna is still alive, I include her.

When architects go on digs, the artifacts they uncover serve as irrefutable scientific evidence of the past. But they’re also objects that connect us to this past on a more visceral, sentimental level than carbon-dating. Physical artifacts can, to the trained eye, go well beyond confirming the existence of history — these objects tell us about habits, customs, fears, superstitions, victories celebrated and losses mourned; they tell us that people existed, and they tell us who those people were.

When my mother’s family moved to Canada from Northern Italy in 1959, they were stuff-less by necessity because there was no home ready for such things. The four of them — my mother, her older sister, and my Nonna and Nonno — first rented part of a house in a predominantly Italian neighbourhood in Guelph, later renting a whole house, all the while saving money for the plot of land they would eventually buy not far away by slowly buying only the stuff they needed: A matching pink couch, loveseat and chair, and a tufted, brocade couch for the basement; a television with knobs you’d twist to change the channels; a solid-wood kitchen table, so massive and imposing I always imagined they lowered it in with a crane before the house had a roof. After her husband died in 1984 — and, I think, even before — Nonna didn't replace things often, if ever, giving the impression that everything I ever knew Nonna to own was all she had ever owned.; Iin my mind she and her furniture, her pots and pans, her plates and cooking tools, are all inextricable from her. iThey were always in the same place (and, consequently, talways in the same place as her),and always in the same condition. Nonna and her things were constants, and while the stuff wasn't expensive or elaborate, but it was hers. She favoured olds sets of dishes for weeknight dinners of meaty pasta or perfect fried chicken cutlets with garlicky, parsley-studded mushrooms, and ancient tupperware for food storage. When things broke a little, she kept using them; when they broke a lot, she would fix them. There was a system to the way things were cared for: No plate or glass ever hit the kitchen table without a coaster or placemat beneath. Nonna cared about her home and possessions not because they were expensive, but because she bought them with her own money, and kept them in good shape. Her independence reflected in the purchase, the care, and the maintenance of a set of powder-pink living room furniture that may well have been brand new if not for their sort of awful late-60s hue. The way Nonna viewed her home and her things reflected how she viewed herself (and vice versa): With meticulous grooming, diligent upkeep, and the ability to either work around breaks as they happened, or fix them on her own. She cared for herself like a person who had the potential for permanence. There came a point when things began to degrade beyond her capacity for repair and upkeep. At first, this had to do mainly with Nonna’s physical limitations. It was difficult for her to descend the stairs to vacuum the basement, for example, so the rec room became permanently sealed off. Soon, my family was beginning to pitch in with laundry and small household chores. Without Nonna’s diligence, the house began to show its age. The plates, pans and utensils in her cupboards collected dust as they fell into disuse — she’d still cook sometimes, sure, but she didn’t have the energy for family dinners anymore. And sometimes, the recipes tasted just a bit off, like she’d forgotten a step, or confused the measurements for a couple of ingredients. She became anxious, distracted, and confused. But despite the physical evidence collecting around her — the house and everything in it, spotless and new for decades, was suddenly old and worn — Nonna denied there was anything wrong. Four years ago, she left a pot of water on the stove so long it was blackened beyond the point of cleaning or repair. She had completely forgotten it was there. In any other context, the incident might have been innocuous, but for Nonna — who had already been slowly losing grip on her stuff, her home, her independence — it was a tipping point. lLiving alone was no longer safe. My family began discussions about moving her to a retirement home, which involved discussions about what would come of her house, and of course, all her things. Near the end of Nonna’s time at the house, that kitchen table — around which we’d gather every Christmas, and at least on Sunday a month — began to crack right down the middle. The springs on the basement couch had become so worn, you’d almost hit the floor if you sat on it. And and who wanted a television that forced you to walk up to it just to change the channel? As anyone who’s divided an estate will tell you, the conversation around a loved one's possessions revolves largely around one question: What do you want? Some things were readily spoken for — the only two pots that remained of the set shipped over from Italy went to my mother and aunt. An espresso set, long coveted by one of my cousins, was set aside for him. The basement furniture, all of it worn by time or by the misuse of my sister and I, was donated or trashed. Last Easter, my sister and I sat down in my aunt’s basement to divide the possessions that had been set aside for us — mostly things from the kitchen. What was initially a conversation of utility, of looking at objects and determining, as I always do when deciding what I should own, whether they’re of actual use to me, became an exercise in remembering Nonna through her possessions. Things became impossible to discard. When presented with the physical manifestation of every Sunday dinner I’d ever eaten, invisibly imprinted with the memory of the woman who cooked them as I watched over her shoulder. I couldn’t imagine living without any of it. I took broken Tupperware that might have once carried leftover lasagna from Nonna’s house to ours, and a full set of cutlery despite already owning more than enough forks. I took a giant gilded soup tureen that I had never even seen before, because I knew it was part of a set that had been carefully carried over on a boat, in 1959, and an awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot whose only use, as far as I can tell, is boiling water. I wrapped it all up in a set of rags—threadbare after years of use dusting the framed photos of Nonno, which, along with some wedding gifts and pieces of jewellery, were the only sentimental things I knew Nonna to own—that are now vacuum sealed and packed away, to preserve Nonna’s crisp hemmed edges, never again to be used for their intended purpose. In Nonna’s things, I can still see her the way I remember her best: Proudly self-sufficient and independent. And if I keep her things clean, in good working order and in good repair, I feel like I can keep that Nonna — the one she herself fought to maintain, the one she tried for so long to deny we were all losing, the one who, in reality, disappeared many years ago — alive forever.

The last time I talked to Nonna on the phone, it was on her 87th birthday. She told me that she was very old now, that she hadn’t really felt up to doing anything that day. She asked if I was happy with my job and my apartment. Then she thanked me for calling and said goodbye. No “I love you.” Until four or five years ago, Nonna would repeat her “I love yous” at the end of a phone call until I had no choice but to hang up on her. I don’t doubt that she still loves me; it’s more likely that these days, after a few minutes, she doesn’t remember who called.

When I was younger, I took for granted what an indomitable force Nonna was. She lived alone and kept a home by herself for three decades, while acting as an emergency contact for my entire family, no matter what we needed: A ride, a loan, a night off. She could be difficult and demanding, but we were close. I was patient with her when she struggled with English, and, later, eager to learn from her when she cooked. When she still lived at home but had begun to experience waking nightmares, I spent a night there, and she felt safe enough to sleep through the night. In my adult life, I have used Nonna’s immovable spirit of independence as a guiding principle. Now, her loss of independence is devastating because it means I have lost the part of her of which I was most in awe, but also, because I am terrified of someday losing my own. The same things that happened to Nonna will probably happen to me, with or without dementia. I might not be able to wash the plates I took from her kitchen to mine, because they’re too heavy. My eyesight might prevent me from patching up small holes in t-shirts and dish cloths, and my back — which is already in bad shape, frankly — could make it hard for me to vacuum my carpets. I might forget how to cook the things I most love to eat. I will get old, and I will fight back against age as it claws back against my ability to do things for myself. And I, like Nonna, might refuse to negotiate and to accept that I simply can’t do things the way I used to. Frankly, I probably will: I’ve adopted a lot of Nonna’s obstinate self-sufficiency. I wonder if I’ll forget her awkwardly-shaped, tall spouted pot on the stove someday, and I wonder who will decide what happens to all of the things I’ve inherited from Nonna after I’ve forgotten that most of them ever existed in the first place. When I first saw how my parents had changed Nonna’s house, was like one of those dreams where you know you’re at your old high school but everything looks like your best friend’s kitchen. The cognitive disconnect was overwhelming. On an early visit, I ran my hand along one of the hallway walls, wondering if I’d be able to physically register that it now ends sooner than it used to. I’d close my eyes while sitting on the new, grey couch and pretend I was still sitting on the old, pink one; a feat of imagination assisted by a living room window that’s still the same width and height that it used to be. Though, with horizontal blinds replacing the old vertical ones — and slightly less light coming in — it feels like everything has gotten a bit colder, and a bit smaller. The truth is actually kind of the opposite: Nonna’s furniture took up so much more space than the stuff my parents own. Especially the table. And somehow, they lifted the massive wood one that hosted all the Christmas dinners, coffees, and conversations we never had anywhere else, and moved it out of the house. Nobody saved it. The crack down its middle had deepened into a chasm; the solid foundation that had once supported our family gatherings was being gradually replaced by a widening, empty gulf, unyielding as it was irreparable.",buzzfeed
9,The Spurs' Game 6 win was the ultimate proof Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate | FOX Sports,"In case that were still up for debate (you know, since the polling closed a month ago), San Antonio's Game 6 blowout of the Houston Rockets with Leonard on the bench served as all the evidence you need.

With Leonard on the sideline, the Spurs played a classic, Spurs-ian game. They moved the ball on offense, finding the open man and punishing the smaller Rockets on the interior. At one point, Houston had 64 total points, while San Antonio had 54 points in the paint alone.

This is no indictment of Leonard, no matter what some might tell you. (If anything, the result showed how valuable James Harden is to the Rockets. When he vanishes while somehow leaving his corporeal form behind, Houston is doomed.) In fact, credit LaMarcus Aldridge for playing within himself and the Spurs' natural offensive flow. He would have looked right at home on the championship-winning teams that beat LeBron James' Miami Heat.

Yet that's the point. The Spurs haven't had that same freedom of movement with Leonard running the offense this season, because he's learning on the job. He's learning quickly, sure, but he's not quite at the elite level as a primary offensive option that so many people think he is.

He's still adding pieces to his game — exploring what it means to be the creator on offense and the destroyer on defense, while trying to strike the balance between the two — and managing to play like one of the NBA's very best players along the way.

It wasn’t all rookies at the event, as the team asked 10-time Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas – the longest-tenured Brown – to attend.

Tight end David Njoku, one of Cleveland’s three first-round picks, probably wishes his first meeting with Thomas went a little bit differently because it was definitely awkward. He thought Thomas was a coach, which I guess is an honest mistake.

But these players, they're testing how long their rope is a fifth of the way through the year. How long can they stay out there before they get pulled?

For some, there's a young player clipping at their heels. For others, a contract that won't protect them from a demotion. Some have neither an immediate, obvious replacement or a short-term deal — they're just playing so poorly their teams have to consider a relegation.

Look no further than matchday 2, when the Blues trailed 1-0 at Watford in August. Fabregas came on in the 78th minute and Chelsea scored an equalizer two minutes later.

9,Happy Hour practice results for Go Bowling 400 | FOX Sports,"Practice is now complete for Saturday night’s Go Bowling 400 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Kansas Speedway following the second of two sessions at the 1.5-mile track on Friday.

Tops in the 85-minute practice was defending race winner Kyle Busch, who ran a best lap of 187.963 miles per hour in his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota.

Second fast was Cup Series points leader Kyle Larson at 187.833 mph. Larson was followed by Martin Truex Jr., who topped the speed charts in the morning practice.

Rounding out the top five were Ryan Blaney and Brad Keselowski. Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished ninth.

There was one major incident and it involved points leader Larson.

Just six minutes into practice, Larson got loose in Turn 2 and hit the wall, forcing his Chip Ganassi Racing crew to pull out the team’s back-up car. Later in the session, Larson’s teammate, Jamie McMurray, brushed the wall, but his damage was considerably less.

Larson said he’d been wrestling with his car all day long. “I felt like I was going to crash every lap since we unloaded today,” said Larson. “We only made like seven laps the first practice because I was spinning out every time.”

And it was a problem that was not confined to Larson.

“I’ve been extremely loose all day. I think a lot of people have,” said Larson. “I don’t know why we are all fighting loose, but we made some big adjustments between the two practices there and I was still really loose.”

Also notable in practice: Carl Long practiced for a Cup Series race for the first time since 2009, when he was fined $200,000 for running a borrowed engine that was 0.17 cubic inches too large during practice for the Sprint Showdown last-chance all-star qualifying race at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Long was 39th of 39 drivers in terms of speed, more than three seconds off the top lap turned in the session. But he made it on track, which is what matters.

Cup qualifying is tonight at 6:45 p.m., with the race on Saturday night, with coverage starting at 7 p.m. ET. Both qualifying and the race will be on FS1.

The Philadelphia Eagles were not. Sam Bradford was entrenched as the starter, giving them a decent, very capable quarterback to go into the season with.

The trade wound up costing Philadelphia two first-round picks (one in 2017), a third- and fourth-rounder in 2016 and a second-round pick in 2018. The Eagles effectively got Wentz and a 2017 fourth-rounder in exchange for five picks, a haul that looked like a major win for the Browns.

The Browns decided to trade down in both 2016 and 2017, turning those five selections into a whopping nine players.

9,No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett admits he ‘can’t be a savior’ for the Browns | FOX Sports,"The Cleveland Browns are in desperate need of a player who can resurrect the franchise and get it back on the winning track. That player will likely be a quarterback one day, but the Browns have yet to find the right man for the job.

Some hope that No. 1 overall pick Myles Garrett can save the team on the defensive side of the ball, but even he knows that’s impossible. He admitted as much Friday when speaking about the Browns in 2017.

“It takes a culmination of all these guys coming together and just having the attitude that we’re not going to lose. And that’s what we’re going to do. I can’t be a savior,” Garrett said, via NFL.com. “But I can be the best I can be. I can give it my all and make plays and dominate my side of the field, but it takes all 11 guys with a certain thought process that we’re going to go out there and we’re going to win.”

Garrett is going to be a Day 1 starter for the Browns and is the favorite to win Defensive Rookie of the Year. He has all the makings of a cornerstone defender in the mold of Von Miller and J.J. Watt, which should provide the fan base with some excitement.

That being said, he’s not going to win the Browns games without a lot of help. He’s not going to turn them into a playoff team after they won just one game in 2016.

Garrett said himself that “one person can’t win games,” making it clear that it takes an entire team to have success in the NFL. Sure, his play as a rookie will help the Browns win more often in 2017 – or at least they hope so – but he can’t do it all.

He remains as confident as ever, though, after saying he wants to sack Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger most in the NFL – and he plans to back it up.

“You just gotta back up your words. Don’t be scared from it or don’t shy from it,” Garrett said. “Make sure, if you’re willing to say something, that you worked hard enough and prepared well enough to back those things up.”",fox-sports
6,Russian jet flies within 20 feet of US Navy plane,"Story highlights Encounter described by US Navy as ""safe and professional""

US official said pilot took photos of US plane

Washington (CNN) A Russian military jet ""came within approximately 20 feet"" of a US Navy P-8A Poseidon surveillance plane while it was flying in international airspace over the Black Sea earlier this week, US Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze told CNN on Friday.

The encounter occurred on Tuesday and was described by the US Navy as ""safe and professional.""

""Distance is only one of many variables considered when defining what is safe and professional,"" Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said. ""For aviation interactions, distance, speed, altitude, rate of closure, visibility and other factors impact whether an event is characterized as safe or unsafe, professional or not professional.""

A US defense official told CNN that the Russian aircraft was armed with six air-to-air missiles and that the pilot took photos of the US plane during the encounter.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, ""The Russian fighter carried out a 'greeting' maneuver. After that, the US surveillance aircraft changed his flying course away from the Russian border.""

3,FBI chief sacking: White House denies Comey loyalty pledge,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Did President Trump threaten the former FBI director in a tweet?

The White House has denied reports that President Donald Trump asked former FBI chief James Comey to pledge loyalty to him.

Press secretary Sean Spicer rejected a New York Times report that the president sounded out Mr Comey at a private White House dinner in January.

According to the newspaper, the now-former FBI director said he would offer the president honesty, but not loyalty.

Mr Trump has faced a backlash for firing Mr Comey on Tuesday.

The FBI probe and parallel congressional investigations into alleged Russian political meddling, and whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the Kremlin, have dogged his young presidency.

In Friday's daily briefing, Mr Spicer refused to comment on questions about whether Mr Trump had been making surreptitious recordings in the White House.

Mr Trump tweeted hours earlier that Mr Comey had ""better hope there are no tapes"" of their conversations.

Mr Spicer denied the tweet was a threat towards Mr Comey.

""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" he told reporters repeatedly when pressed about the tweet. ""The tweet speaks for itself"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump addresses the reasons for the sacking in an NBC interview

However, Mr Comey believes ""if there is a tape, there is nothing he is worried about"", a source told CNN.

Mr Trump's comments provoked fresh comparisons between his administration and that of disgraced President Richard Nixon, who famously recorded conversations, speeding his downfall during the Watergate scandal.

Why is Watergate in the news again?

The top Democrats on the House judiciary and oversight committees wrote to the White House on Friday demanding copies of any recordings.

John Conyers and Elijah Cummings' letter noted ""it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony"".

'Flooding the zone': Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher

Donald Trump was reportedly unhappy with how his press team handled fallout from Tuesday's decision to fire Mr Comey, so he's taken things into his own hands. Boy, has he.

First he gave an interview that essentially undercut all the arguments White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, had made to paint the Comey sacking as an operation conducted through normal channels. Now he has taken to Twitter in earnest, spraying a barrage of allegations, accusations and aggressions against Democrats, the media and Mr Comey himself.

In sports terms, the strategy could be described as ""flooding the zone"" - launching a ferocious, full-out assault to overwhelm an opponent's defences. In this case, Mr Trump has the media scrambling to decide which story merits the most coverage.

Is it the details of the Comey-Trump dinner and the president's hints of secret ""tapes""? His threat to cancel press briefings? The Oval Office visit by a Russian entourage? Perhaps, as Mr Trump suggests, the ""real news"" is the tentative trade agreement between the US and China on beef and poultry products?

When everything is a big story, nothing is. At least, that's what Mr Trump may hope.

Mr Comey has declined an invitation to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee next Tuesday.

President Trump told NBC News that Mr Comey had requested the one-on-one, but the former FBI director reportedly maintains that it was the president who invited him.

Mr Comey had said he was ""uneasy"" before the dinner, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

He told MSNBC on Friday that he had spoken to Mr Comey before the White House meeting.

Read more:

The FBI chief had confided he was concerned it might compromise his Trump-Russia inquiry.

Mr Trump has said Mr Comey told him three times he was not a target of the FBI inquiry, comments that have raised accusations among opponents that the president was interfering in the investigation.

Still chafing at media coverage of the firing, Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do Trump supporters think about Comey's firing?

Mr Spicer said the president was a ""little dismayed"" that his press team's attempts to give out information were being turned into a ""game of gotcha"" by the media.

Mr Trump doubled down in an interview with Fox News by threatening to hold the press briefings only once a fortnight, with himself at the podium.

""Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don't have them. I think it's a good idea. First of all, you have a level of hostility that's incredible and it's very unfair.""

9,NFLPA sets up reserve fund in case of work stoppage,"NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (Photo: H. Darr Beiser, USA TODAY Sports)

If the NFL goes through another work stoppage after the 2020 season, its players union intends to be ready financially — and efforts to save money are about to ramp up.

The NFL Players Association’s board of representatives approved a resolution in March that will divert millions of dollars in licensing royalties to a work-stoppage fund, three people with knowledge of the resolution told USA TODAY Sports this week.

Based on current rates, that could add in the neighborhood of $90 million to the NFLPA’s coffers over the next four years before the current collective bargaining agreement expires around March 2021, on top of union dues that already are saved for that purpose.

According to one of the people — all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because NFLPA resolutions aren’t public — players still will receive their royalty checks this fall as usual from the 2016 fiscal year. Only the “equal share” distributed to all players will be affected starting next year, not any additional royalties earned by individuals, the person said.

MORE NFL:

The NFLPA’s last annual report, filed in June 2016 with the U.S. Department of Labor, shows the equal share was $13,200 for 2015. Multiplied over 53 players on 32 active rosters, the total would be $22,387,200. That doesn’t factor in additional players who spend time on rosters, nor the probability of annual growth in the multibillion-dollar industry.

The resolution passed in March says royalties would be held in the work stoppage fund until there is a work stoppage or upon a player’s retirement. If there’s no work stoppage, the funds would be paid out to players immediately upon approval of a new CBA. If there is a work stoppage, the funds would be paid out as determined by the NFLPA board — something it did a little over a month after owners locked out players in March 2011.

A person with knowledge of the NFL’s thinking said the league has no such work-stoppage fund at this time. (In 2011, the union contended the NFL had illegally secured a “war chest” of $4 billion in TV revenue as a means to survive the lockout, leading to one of many legal battles.)

The league has approached the union several times about renegotiating the 2011 CBA, but no bargaining talks have occurred, people with knowledge of the situation said.

Among other issues that could prompt an early extension, the NFL is out of so-called “stadium credits” to support construction as allotted under the 2011 CBA. The evolving media landscape creates a new frontier for negotiating TV deals that are a primary revenue source (one from which players draw 55% under the current deal.) The commissioner’s authority over discipline and offseason practice rules also are sure to come up, but financial matters drive everything.

Amidst labor strife, money tends to create a pain point more quickly for players, many of whom can’t afford to miss paychecks that usually begin in September. Union dues, which ranged from $1,000 to $16,312.50 last year, already go into savings. (The NFLPA listed over $314 million in net assets, including over $60 million in cash, on its federal filing last year.)

Replacing the late Gene Upshaw after his death in 2008, NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith had been on the job less than two years when the 2011 lockout hit. Creating the work-stoppage fund is one way the union seems to be using the extra lead time to get ready.",usa-today

Critics frequently accuse the Kremlin of wanting to discredit US politics. That work seems to be proceeding without them.

That ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, dubbed a key Russian spy by US officials, is at the center of allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials that Comey was investigating before he was dismissed.

6,Sources: Rosenstein sees no need for special prosecutor in Russia probe,"(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doesn't see a need at this point for a special prosecutor in the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, people familiar with his thinking tell CNN.

Democratic lawmakers and others have pushed for the move in the wake of the controversy over President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Critics of the Trump administration's handling of the Russia investigation have long held the view that a special prosecutor is needed.

The investigation is led by Dana Boente, the US attorney in Alexandria, Va., who also serves as the head of national security prosecutions at Justice Department headquarters.

One source says Rosenstein isn't inclined to make a change unless the FBI investigation appears to be imperiled. And at this point, FBI officials are confident that the investigation is moving ahead, despite Comey's abrupt firing earlier this week.

Indeed, Rosenstein has privately vowed to lawmakers and staff that he plans to allow the bureau's investigation to move forward, uninhibited by pressures from the White House.

WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has indicated that he is not yet inclined to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the FBI's inquiry into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

The ultimate decision on whether to seek an outside counsel, which Democrats have demanded following President Trump's abrupt dismissal of FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, falls to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any involvement in the Russia probe.

The latest details on Rosenstein's position on the matter, which was first reported by CNN, comes as the Justice Department leader agreed to brief the full Senate on his role in President Trump's firing of Comey.

Rosenstein, who along with Sessions recommended Comey's dismissal, informed Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer's office on Friday that he would meet with senators next week, according to Matt House, Schumer's spokesman. The time and date are still being worked out, he said.

Rosenstein is certain to face grilling from Democrats, who have ramped up their calls a special prosecutor to takeover the Russia investigation. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, pushed the issue further on Friday, saying Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor or resign.

Contrary to his administration's early assertions, Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt on Thursday he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein and Sessions' recommendation. He added that he was thinking of ""this Russia thing"" when he made the decision, calling it a ""made-up story.""

In a morning tweetstorm, he appeared to threaten Comey if he leaked ""tapes"" of their conversations to the media.

James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017

Durbin cast Trump's statement as an admission that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation, which he said is ""dangerously close to obstruction of justice."" He said Trump's tweet could be another violation of law.

""This morning, the President tweeted a thinly-veiled threat to Mr. Comey, which could be construed as threatening a witness in this investigation, which is another violation of federal law,"" Durbin said in a statement. ""To preserve his reputation as a credible prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must appoint an independent special prosecutor to pursue possible criminal charges, or he must resign.""

Read more:

In a memo to Sessions justifying Comey's dismissal, Rosenstein cited Comey’s controversial handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. But there has been wide skepticism among Democrats and some Republicans about the president's motives.

Because of Rosenstein's role, Schumer has argued that a non-political appointee of the Justice Department should be responsible for tapping a special prosecutor rather than Rosenstein. He called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to invite not only Rosenstein but Sessions to brief all senators in separate and possibly classified meetings.

McConnell has said that opening a new probe into the Trump campaign's alleged Russian connections would impede the work of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation.

Comey had been invited to testify before the committee on Tuesday, but the panel's top-ranking Democrat said on MSNBC on Friday that won't happen. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said he hopes Comey will appear before the committee in the ""not too distant future.""

""I have enormous respect for Jim Comey and I believe that at the appropriate time and place he's going to tell his side of the story and my hope is that that place at least will be in front of our committee,"" Warner said.

“I wasn’t sure how this team was going to be post-Tim Duncan. And this team grew on me all year long. I just like what it’s made of. I like the will and I like the skill. There’s some grit and guts to this team featuring Patty Mills and Manu Ginobli, that I love.

""And I think it’s going to shine through against Golden State. So im going to say that the Spurs are going to win this in seven games because if LeBron can win a Game 7 in Oakland, I believe my Spurs can win one this year. And if they do, LeBron James is in trouble because I will guarantee you my Spurs will beat LeBron in the Finals if they can get through Golden State.”",fox-sports
9,Daniel Cormier vs. Jon Jones 2 official for UFC 214 in Anaheim | FOX Sports,"More than a year after their last fight was cancelled, light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier will finally met Jon Jones at UFC 214 in Anaheim on July 29.

The new bout was announced as part of the UFC’s Summer Kickoff press conference on Friday.

The two longtime rivals were last scheduled to meet at UFC 200 last July, but Jones was pulled off the card after he was flagged for a doping violation stemming from an out-of-competition drug test.

Cormier stayed on the card where he defeated former middleweight champion Anderson Silva. Jones ultimately faced a one-year suspension as a result of his UFC anti-doping policy infraction but he returns to eligibility in July.

Cormier (19-1) fought most recently at UFC 210 in Buffalo where he submitted Anthony “Rumble” Johnson with an impressive performance to mark his second title defense since winning the belt in 2015.

Meanwhile, Jones (22-1) has gone through a tumultuous few years to finally get back to fight for the light heavyweight title again.

Jones was initially stripped of the belt after he was involved in a hit-and-run accident that ended with a long suspension from the UFC. Jones finally returned last April where he defeated Ovince Saint-Preux by unanimous decision to win an interim title while Cormier was out of action due to injury.

Jones was then stripped of that belt after he tested positive for the banned substance before he sat out for a year as punishment.

Now the long road back will lead Jones to a rematch with arguably his greatest rival while Cormier tries to erase the only loss of his professional fighting career.",fox-sports
9,Watch the goal that clinched the Premier League title for Chelsea | FOX Sports,"For more than 80 minutes, it looked as though Chelsea’s title-winning celebrations would have to be put on hold. West Bromwich Albion played a tight and organized defense under Tony Pulis at the Hawthorns, keeping a lid on the Blues. Chelsea pushed forward, and the Baggies pushed them away.

With the Blues looking frustrated, manager Antonio Conte pulled a double switch to try and find a difference-maker. Surprisingly, off came Eden Hazard and Pedro for Willian and Michy Batshuayi in the 75th and 76th minutes. But as he’s done all season, Conte pressed the exact right button as the seldom-used Batshauyi delivered the title-clinching goal in the 82nd minute.

And, exhale. It wasn’t the prettiest match-winner, but it counted all the same. It was just Batshuayi’s second Premier League goal of the season, his first since matchday 2. The Belgian has played a grand total of 123 minutes in the competition and was viewed as a bit of a bust following his €39 million summer transfer from Marseille.

He came through when the Blues needed him, though. His first year with Chelsea might not have been as impactful as he would have liked, but Friday’s goal certainly made it unforgettable.",fox-sports
9,Watch Chelsea players go nuts celebrating their Premier League title | FOX Sports,"The English Premier League has a new champion. It’s not as if anyone other than Chelsea were expected to come out on top, but the inevitability of it all sure didn’t dampen the excitement of the team or its supporters, who all celebrated Friday’s win like crazy.

While a lot of people made Chelsea’s title run possible, the trophy is arguably manager Antonio Conte’s, as he masterminded Chelsea’s tactical identity that made them the best in the league. The fans knew it too, singing his name after the whistle while players through the Italian coach into the air:

9,Former champ Chris Weidman faces Kelvin Gastelum at FOX UFC Fight Night in New York | FOX Sports,"Former middleweight champion Chris Weidman said it was a dream to one day fight at Nassau Coliseum near his home on Long Island, New York.

Now he’ll get his chance.

Weidman will face rising middleweight contender Kelvin Gastelum in the main event at FOX UFC Fight Night on July 22 in New York.

The new matchup was announced as part of the UFC’s Summer Kickoff press conference on Friday.

Weidman (13-3) will have to contain his excitement about fighting close to home as he attempts to stave off a four fight losing streak when he returns in July.

The former champion has fallen on harder times lately with three straight TKO losses, although the most recent defeat to Gegard Mousasi came in controversial fashion after the fight was stopped due to a pair of knee strikes that the referee deemed illegal. The knees landed were actually legal and rather than restarting the fight, Weidman was deemed unable to continue and the bout was stopped.

As for Gastelum (13-2, 1 NC), the fight will serve as his third straight bout since returning to the middleweight division.

Gastelum was originally supposed to face Anderson Silva at UFC 212 in Brazil but he tested positive for marijuana following his last bout against Vitor Belfort in March before he was suspended 90 days for the infraction.

Now Gastelum will look to maintain his current momentum against another former champion in Weidman as he steps into enemy territory for the matchup in New York in a five round bout.",fox-sports

6,Lib Dems to back a 'regulated cannabis market' in UK,"Image caption The party has long argued drugs laws are a ""failure"" and made fresh calls for a regulated cannabis market

The Liberal Democrats would legalise selling and growing cannabis if elected, the party has confirmed ahead of publishing its manifesto.

The party would allow licensed shops to sell the drug to over-18s, let people grow cannabis at home and introduce small ""cannabis social clubs"".

The Lib Dem spring conference in 2016 backed a regulated cannabis market.

The party's manifesto will also include a promise to extend paid parental leave for fathers from two weeks to a month.

Under UK legislation, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments - but many argue that the law is not enforced.

Supplying or producing cannabis, which is a class ""B"" drug, attracts a maximum 14-year prison sentence, unlimited fine or both, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

'Criminal gangs'

It is legal to consume small amounts of marijuana in some other countries - including Norway, the Netherlands and Portugal - while in other countries police do not arrest people for possession.

In 2001, Portugal became the first country in the world to decriminalise the use of all drugs.

Last year, the Lib Dems backed proposals for a ""regulated market"" to control the pricing, potency and packaging of sales to over-18s.

The proposals were outlined in a report, co-authored by the government's former chief drugs adviser Sir David Nutt, which argued that cannabis should be taxed - and that doing so could yield up to £1bn a year for the government.

Image caption In the Netherlands, cannabis products are sold in ""coffee shops"" and possession of small amounts for personal use is allowed

The Lib Dems' Julian Huppert confirmed the policy would appear in its upcoming manifesto to BuzzFeed, saying: ""The market is run by criminal gangs and they have no interest in public health - the system is causing huge amounts of harm.""

During the 2015 election campaign, the Lib Dems called for drug use to be treated as a health rather than a public policy issue.

Labour in its 2015 manifesto called for better drug treatment services, while the Conservatives said they would introduce random drug-testing in jails.

Speaking last year, the Lib Dems' health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said that ""the war on drugs has been a catastrophic failure"".

""We criminalise thousands of people, blighting their careers,"" he said. ""When people buy cannabis from criminals, they have no idea what they are buying.""

'Health and happiness'

The party is also promising extra paid paternity leave - which it is calling ""Daddy Month"" in a bid to encourage more sharing of parental responsibilities.

Jo Swinson, equalities minister in the coalition government when shared parental leave was introduced in 2015, said: ""More needs to be done to encourage men to take leave when they become a dad.

""Research shows that fathers being more involved in their children's lives is good for children's development and good for the health and happiness of the whole family.""

Labour has also said it supports extending paid paternity leave.",bbc-news

9,Danica Patrick on Stenhouse Jr. win: 'We absolutely never mess with each other' | FOX Sports,"In any healthy adult relationship, establishing clear-cut boundaries is important for both parties. Even when the two parties are both Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series drivers.

So when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. scored his first career Cup win Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway, there was no trash talk towards his girlfriend and rival driver Danica Patrick.

Patrick said Friday at Kansas Speedway that teasing each other about what happens on the track is strictly forbidden

“We absolutely never mess with each other when it comes to that stuff,” said Patrick. “I think it is obviously because it means so much to us that it is a pretty crappy thing to do. Would you mess with your wife or girlfriend?”

Recreational sports, however, are fair game.

“When it comes to golf or something I will totally mess with him but when it comes to something like this (racing), no,” Patrick said. “We don’t talk about that at all. I was just simply happy for him and my weekend sucked yet again. Actually my weekend didn’t really suck. I had a fine race going and it just ended early so I had another terrible result, which has been the case so far this year.”

That said, Patrick was clearly happy to see Stenhouse win, which was made easier by the fact that she got wrecked and knocked out of the race.

“I am really glad I had the chance to watch him win,” she said. “I think that was pretty cool and that I was ready to go. All I did was throw my tennis shoes on and got out the door on the golf cart and went to victory lane and waited for him to pull in.

“That was a gift of an experience to be able to have in our relationship because most of the time I would be dealing with my team and dealing with whatever I had going on. I had that chance to regroup,” Patrick said. “I was fresh as a daisy. I had showered and spend the afternoon standing around celebrating with him. It was a great day.”

9,Michael Johnson welcomes Justin Gaethje to the UFC at 'Ultimate Fighter 25' Finale | FOX Sports,"Highly touted lightweight Justin Gaethje has officially booked his first fight in the UFC.

The undefeated knockout artist, who just recently inked a multi-fight deal with the UFC, will face off with veteran competitor Michael Johnson in the main event at “The Ultimate Fighter” 26 finale on July 7 in Las Vegas.

The new fight was announced as part of the UFC’s Summer Kickoff press conference on Friday in Dallas.

Gaethje (17-0) was one of the most sought after free agents available in the open market after finishing out his previous contract with World Series of Fighting.

During his time with that promotion, Gaethje reigned as lightweight champion would putting on some of the most thrilling bouts every single time he stepped into the cage. Now Gaethje will look to test himself against the best of the best in the UFC starting with his fight against Johnson.

Johnson (17-11) will look to hand Gaethje his first professional loss as he steps back into the Octagon for the first time since suffering a loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov last November at UFC 205.

Prior to that setback, Johnson earned a “Performance of the Night” bonus for his stunning first round knockout against Dustin Poirier.

6,Trump lying about Comey firing isn't new,"This is the same guy who maintained for years that Obama was born in Kenya.

Protest in Washington on May 10, 2017. (Photo: Shawn Thew, epa)

Even before President Trump announced his firing of FBI director James Comey last Tuesday, the White House was mired in a credibility crisis. Trump’s dictatorial tendencies, his apparent inability to tell a consistent story and his perennial challenge with the truth have brought us, in the eyes of some of his critics, to the verge of a constitutional crisis. At the very least, his behavior has made it virtually impossible for anyone but the most gullible to believe much of what he says — including the reasons given for firing Comey.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner deemed “laughable” the official explanation that Comey was fired for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email scandal. And that laughable explanation — added to countless other questionable or outright false statements from Trump and his surrogates — has forced America to grapple with a serious question: What happens when government believes in neither facts nor in the truth? We are beginning to find out.

This week, before Comey’s firing shocked the nation, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was dismissing several members of its Board of Scientific Counselors with an eye toward replacing them with industry hacks. Impartial scientists and their bothersome facts apparently are no longer welcome at the EPA.

Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he was replacing his predecessor’s “Smart on Crime” initiative with what can only be called a “Stupid on Crime” punitive approach that few serious scholars of criminal justice believe is either warranted or effective.

This, of course, comes on the heels of the House passage of a health care bill whose likely bad consequences Trump’s supporters chose to deny and whose tax cuts were peddled to the public using the same “voodoo economics” rationale that George H. W. Bush rightly denounced nearly four decades ago.

Trump’s distaste for truth and verifiable facts is no surprise. During the presidential campaign The New York Times reminded readers that in 2011 Trump settled a case claiming that he and members of his family had lied about the market for his luxury condominium hotel apartments. And The Washington Post exhaustively reported on a 2007 deposition in which Trump admitted repeating false allegations rooted in nothing more than “my perception.” Then, of course, there was the years-long running roadshow during which Trump suggested Barack Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim. That misbegotten crusade yielded gems such as this one from a Trump appearance on The Today Show: “His grandmother in Kenya said, 'Oh, no, he was born in Kenya…' She's on tape and I think that tape's going to be produced fairly soon. Somebody is coming out with a book in two weeks, it will be very interesting."" No book or tape, of course, ever came out. It was all just a figment of Trump’s peculiar “perception.”

Following Trump’s electoral college victory, the only real question was whether he would bring the methods and ethics of a truth-challenged real estate huckster to what is arguably the most important job in the world — a job in which integrity and truth should count for something. After a blizzard of tweets and comments — including the notable nonsense that Obama tapped Trump’s phones — the answer is obvious.

Trump’s treatment of Comey is nothing if not consistent with his past behavior. As widely reported, during the campaign, Trump praised Comey for his “guts” and for making “the move” on Clinton. Now Trump finds those very actions grounds for dismissal. What is the truth of how Trump actually feels? Apparently, he expects people to accept whatever version of truth or untruth is convenient for him at the moment. And while that may have worked well for a while, even gullible people have their limits — which Trump is sorely testing.

Still, Trump’s people are shocked, SHOCKED, that so many of his constituents don’t believe him, that despite Trump wrapping himself in the trappings and power of the White House, many look at him and still see the real-estate salesman out to con a gullible public for his own glory and enrichment.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

When the Trump administration came to office, we heard a lot about so-called alternative facts. But what we are seeing instead is a government that prefers to act on the basis of no facts at all and that dismisses truth with assertions that often prove to be lies — all the while shouting about fake news.

Unfortunately, dismissed facts don’t simply go away. Eventually many surface as serious problems — problems that could and should have been foreseen and addressed. The question Trump’s presidency vividly raises is how much his fellow Americans are prepared to accept or buy into his fantastical fact-free approach. Clearly many are already fed up. Others, for any number of possible reasons (apathy, anger, fear and gullibility among them), are content to close their eyes to the consequences of Trump’s actions. Also, because Trump is no longer a simple reality star and real estate flim flam man but the most powerful politician in the world, there is a sincere desire, in some quarters, to believe in him — if only out of respect for the office he holds. But perhaps what most empowers Trump is partisanship, the reluctance of all but a precious few of his fellow Republicans to utter anything remotely resembling criticism of him, or to demand that he be held to account — even if that makes them complicit in covering up possible collusion with a foreign power. It should not be so difficult for anointed guardians of the public trust to demand truth, transparency and accountability; but it seems that much of the modern Republican Party has lost is way. And Trump is only too happy to lead his feckless enablers ever farther into the weeds.
